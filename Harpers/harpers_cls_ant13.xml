<div2 id="crossmacedonia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Macedonia">Macedonia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μακεδονία</foreign>). A country in Europe, north of Greece, said to have been originally named <ref type="cross" target="crossemathia">Emathia</ref>. Its boundaries before the time of Philip, the father of Alexander, were, on the south, Olympus and the Cambunian Mountains, which separated it from Thessaly and Epirus; on the east, the river Strymon, which separated it from Thrace; and on the north and west, Illyria and Paeonia. Macedonia was greatly enlarged by the conquests of Philip. He added to his kingdom Paeonia on the north; a part of Thrace on the east as far as the river Nestus, which Thracian district was usually called Macedonia Adiecta; the peninsula Chalcidicé on the south; and on the west a part of Illyria as far as Lake Lychnitis. On the conquest of the country by the Romans, B.C. 168, Macedonia was divided into four districts, independent of one another; but the whole country was formed into a Roman province after the conquest of the Achaeans in 146.</p>
 <p>Macedonia may be described as a large plain, surrounded on three sides by lofty mountains. Through this plain, however, run many smaller ranges of mountains, between which are wide and fertile valleys, extending from the coast far into the interior. The chief mountains were Scordus, <cb /> or Scardus, on the northwest frontier, towards Illyria and Dardania; further east Orbelus and Scomius, which separated it from Moesia; and Rhodopé, which extended from Scomius in a southeasterly direction, forming the boundary between Macedonia and Thrace. On the southern frontier were the Cambunii Montes and Olympus. The chief rivers were in the direction of east to west— the Nestus, the Strymon, the Axius, the largest of all, the Ludias or Lydias, and the Haliacmon. The chief cities were Aegae and Pella, the capitals, and Pydna, Potidaea, Olynthus, Amphipolis, and Philippi. The great bulk of the inhabitants of Macedonia consisted of Thracian and Illyrian tribes. At an early period some Greek tribes settled in the southern part of the country. They are said to have come from Argos, and to have been led by the three sons of Temenus, the Perdiccas, the youngest of the three, was looked upon as the founder of the Macedonian monarchy. A later tradition, however, regarded Caranus, who was also a Heraclid from Argos, as the founder of the monarchy. These Greek settlers intermarried with the original inhabitants of the country. The dialect which they spoke was akin to the Doric, but it contained many barbarous words and forms; and the Macedonians accordingly were never regarded by the other <figure id="fig.00989">
<head orig="Silver Coin of Macedonia after the Roman Conquest.">Silver Coin of Macedonia after the Roman Conquest.</head>
</figure> Greeks as genuine Hellenes. Moreover, it was only in the south of Macedonia that the Greek language was spoken. See Brugmann, <title>Comp. Gram.</title> vol. i. p. 7.</p>
 <p>Very little is known of the history of Macedonia till the reign of Amyntas I., who was a contemporary of Darius Hystaspis; but from that time their history is more or less intimately connected with that of Greece, till at length Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, became the virtual master of the whole of Greece. The conquests of Alexander extended the Macedonian supremacy over a great part of Asia; and the Macedonian kings continued to exercise their sovereignty over Greece till the conquest of Perseus by the Romans, in B.C. 168, brought the Macedonian monarchy to a close.

 <p>A Roman emperor from April, A.D. 217, to June 218. Born of humble parentage at the Mauretanian Caesarea, he became praetorian praefect under Caracalla, whom he accompanied against the Parthians, and whose death he procured, in order that he might become his successor. As emperor he won considerable popularity by the remission of certain oppressive taxes, but suffering at Nisibis a defeat at the hands of the Parthians, and losing the love of his soldiers by his severe discipline, he was attacked by the forces who had proclaimed Elagabalus as emperor and defeated by them. Escaping in disguise, he was taken prisoner in Chalcedon and put to death. His life has come down to us written by Capitolinus.

 <p>A grammarian probably of Greek extraction, since he says in the preface to his <title>Saturnalia</title> that Latin was to him a foreign tongue. He lived in the fourth century A.D., and was probably a pagan. His extant works are: (1) <title>Saturnaliorum Conviviorum Libri VII.</title>, consisting of a series of discussions on history, mythology, criticism, and various points of antiquarian research, supposed to have been delivered during the holidays of the Saturnalia at the house of Vettius Praetextatus, who was invested with the highest offices of State under Valentinian and Valens. The form of the work is avowedly copied from the dialogues of Plato, especially the <title>Banquet:</title> in substance it bears a strong resemblance to the <title>Noctes Atticae</title> of Gellius; and the material of it is drawn from a great variety of sources, such as Suetonius, Seneca, Plutarch, and Athenaeus. The first book treats of the festivals of Saturnus and Ianus, of the Roman calendar, etc. The second book commences with a collection of bon mots, ascribed to the most celebrated wits of antiquity; to these are appended a series of essays on matters connected with the pleasures of the table. The following four books are devoted to criticisms on Vergil. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvergilius-maro">Vergilius</ref>.) The seventh book is of a more miscellaneous character than the preceding. The <title>Saturnalia</title> contains the first pagan mention of the Slaughter of the Innocents at Bethlehem (ii. 4).</p>

A river in Asia Minor, proverbial for its wanderings, rising in the south of Phrygia, close to the source of the Marsyas, flowing between Lydia and Caria, of which it forms the boundary, and at last falling into the Icarian Sea between Myus and Priené. Its chief tributaries are the Marsyas, Cludrus, Lethaeus, and Gaeson on the right (northern) side; and the Obrimas, Lycus , Harpasus, and a second Marsyas on the left (southern) side.

<div2 id="crossmaecenas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Maecēnas</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gaius Cilnius</foreName>
 <p>A famous statesman, courtier, and patron of literature of the Augustan Age at Rome. The date of his birth is uncertain, but is to be placed between the years B.C. 73 and 63, on the 13th of April ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>iv. 11</bibl>). His family was of Etruscan origin—a great subject of boasting in a society where Etruscomania was as great a fad as is Anglomania in certain American communities to-day—and was even traced to Porsena, so that we find Augustus addressing him in his somewhat ironical style as <title>berylle Porsenae</title> (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 4" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 4</bibl>).</p>
 <p>He received a careful education, and was well versed in both Greek and Roman literature, to which he himself contributed in verse as well as prose. He is thought to have been with Octavius in Apollonia at the time of the assassination of Iulius Caesar, perhaps as the director of his studies; and from this time his name appears continually <cb /> in conjunction with that of the future emperor. He assisted in arranging a marriage between Augustus and Scribonia, the daughter of Libo, and negotiated the peace of Brundisium by which Antony and Augustus were temporarily reconciled, and which led to the marriage of Antony with Octavia, the sister of Augustus (Dio Cass. xlviii. 16; <title>B. C.</title> v. 64). In B.C. 36 he accompanied Augustus to Sicily in the campaign against Sextus Pompeius, from which he was twice sent back to Rome to suppress revolts that had there broken out. So well did he discharge the task that he was soon after placed in charge first of Rome and then of the administration of all Italy. In this capacity he crushed out the dangerous conspiracy of the younger Lepidus, which contained the germs of a disastrous civil war; and in every way he so justified the confidence reposed in him as to have received from Augustus his seal and a commission to act with Agrippa as the personal representative of the young Caesar in all negotiations with the Senate.</p>
 <p>After the establishment of the Empire he continued for a long time to exercise a supreme influence in the counsels of Augustus. By his advice, against that of Agrippa, Augustus decided not to restore the Republic (Dio Cass. lii. 14); and it was Maecenas who brought about the marriage of Iulia, the daughter of Augustus, with Agrippa. The influence of Maecenas over his master continued undiminished until about the year B.C. 18, when by his own choice the former withdrew from any active participation in matters of State. This withdrawal was coincident with a coolness that arose between the two men, which rendered their personal intercourse one of much restraint, and which, though it has been often explained as due to the predominance of Agrippa in the favour of the emperor, is much more certainly to be ascribed to the seduction by Augustus of Terentia, the wife of Maecenas. This woman, beautiful and accomplished, was the object of her husband's passionate love, and to a nature such as his—sensitive, ardent, and honourable—the thought of her continued infidelity was not to be endured with the complaisant toleration that so many Roman husbands appear to have exhibited. The city was filled with the pasquinades in which the wits of the day jeered at the progress of this amour. Even Augustus, who was remarkably thick-skinned, is said by Tacitus to have made a journey to Gaul on one occasion (B.C. 16) to escape the shower of epigrams, jests, and lampoons, and it is easy to surmise what torture they must have inflicted upon the statesman who felt himself to be at once injured and made a public laughing-stock. (See Dio Cass. liv. 19; lv. 7;  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>68</bibl>, in which last passage the Terentilla alluded to in Antony's indecent letter is undoubtedly Terentia.) Maecenas died in B.C. 8, leaving no children.</p>
 <p>Maecenas is best known as the fosterer of literature and literary men, so much so that his very name has passed into all languages as a generic term for a munificent patron of letters. His enormous fortune ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 53</bibl><bibl n="Tac. Ann. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. Ann., 55</bibl>) made it possible for him to give a princely protection and support to poets, wits, and, in fact, to all the virtuosi of distinction, who were received with magnificent hospitality at his mansion on the Esquiline, with its beautiful gardens, in which he spent nearly all the year, visiting the country but seldom 
<pb n="992" /><cb /></p>
 <p>( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 53</bibl>). So lavish was his entertainment that it became open to the charge of being too indiscriminate, so that Augustus called his table <seg lang="la">mensa parasitica</seg> ( <title>Vit. Horat.</title>). It must be recollected, however, that he drew the line very sharply between his general hospitality and his private friendship, which last was reserved for the select few, such as Vergil and Horace, who were possessed of the fine culture and delicate feeling so essential to familiar intercourse among gentlemen.</p>
 <p>Much of the personal eccentricity which Maecenas exhibited must be ascribed to the condition of his health. He suffered for many years from insomnia and nervous prostration, and resorted to many devices to secure sleep, listening to soft music and to the plash in his house of artificial waterfalls; and his luxurious indolence was perhaps only the self-indulgence of an invalid, seeking distraction from the thought of his own condition. His passionate clinging to life is best expressed in a short verse of his that has come down to us in the pages of Seneca, and whose frantic eagerness is at once pathetic and repulsive: <lb />“Debilem facito manu <lb />Debilem pede, coxa; <lb />Tuber adstrue gibberum <lb />Lubricos quate dentes: <lb />Vita dum superest, bene est. <lb />Hanc mihi vel acuta <lb />Si sedeam cruce sustine.”</p>

 <p>The richest of the plebeian knights, who employed his fortune in buying up corn in Etruria in the great famine at Rome in B.C. 439. This corn he sold to the poor at a small price, or distributed it gratuitously. The patricians accused him of aiming at the kingly power, and appointed L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, then eighty years of age, as dictator. C. Servilius Ahala, the master of the horse, summoned Maelius to appear before the tribunal of the dictator; but as he refused to go, Ahala rushed into the crowd and slew him. His property was confiscated and his house pulled down; its vacant site, which was called the Aequimaelium, continued to subsequent ages a memorial of his fate.

The two consuls completed the subjugation of Latium; they were both rewarded with a triumph, and equestrian statues were erected to their honour in the Forum. The statue of Maenius was placed upon a column, called Columna Maenia, which appears to have stood near the end of the Forum, on the Capitoline. Maenius, in his censorship (B.C. 318), allowed balconies to be added to the various buildings surrounding the Forum, in order that the spectators might obtain more room for beholding the games which were exhibited there: these balconies were called after him <hi rend="SmallCaps">Maeniāna</hi> (sc. <seg lang="la">aedificia</seg>).</p>

 <p>(3) A contemporary of Lucilius. He was a great spendthrift, who squandered all his property, and afterwards supported himself by playing the buffoon. He possessed a house in the Forum, which Cato in his censorship (184) purchased of him for the purpose of building the Basilica Porcia. Some of the scholiasts on Horace relate that when Maenius sold his house, he reserved for himself one column, the Columna Maenia, from which he built a balcony that he might thence witness the games. The true origin of the Columna Maenia and of the balconies called Maeniana has been explained above.

<head orig="Magistrātus">Magistratus</head>

 <p> at Rome, designated alike the office and the office-holder, the magistracy and the magistrate.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. The Republican Magistrates</hi>. In the widest sense the term <seg lang="la">magistratus</seg> included all the governmental officers of the State, elected and appointed, civil and military. In a narrower sense it was restricted to the officials elected by the Roman people, excluding the promagistrates (proconsuls, propraetors, etc.), whose authority rested on decrees of the Senate, and the subordinate officers with delegated powers who were appointed by the magistrates. In the narrowest and most usual 
<pb n="994" /><cb />
 sense the term was not extended to include the subordinate military officers (<seg lang="la">tribuni militum</seg>) or the city officials below the rank of quaestor (<seg lang="la">vigintisexviri, curatores</seg>, etc.), in spite of the fact that these were elected by the people. On the other hand the dictator or <seg lang="la">magister populi</seg> and his lieutenant, the <seg lang="la">magister equitum</seg>, although not elected, were always regarded and described as magistrates.</p>
 <p>1. <title>Historical Development.</title> In the early Republic the only regular or ordinary magistrates were the consuls and the quaestors; the only extraordinary magistrates the dictator and his lieutenant. The tribunes and aediles of the plebs, officials whose right and duty it was to protect their order against the regular magistrates, were not regarded as magistrates until the struggle between the orders had come to an end. The <seg lang="la">decemviri legibus scribendis</seg> (B.C. 451-449) and the military tribunes (B.C. 444-367), who for a time replaced the consuls and exercised consular powers, were regarded as magistrates; and so also were the censors, praetors, and curule aediles, officials who were first elected during or at the close of the conflict between the orders. With the termination of this conflict and the recognition of the plebeian tribunes and aediles as representatives of the whole people, the list of magistrates, as the term was commonly employed, was closed. For fuller description, see the special article upon each magistracy. For the promagistracy, fully developed only towards the end of the Republic, see <ref type="cross" target="crossprovincia">Provincia</ref>.</p>
 <p>From the period of the conflict between the orders dates the division of magistracies into “patrician” and “plebeian.” In the later Republic the term patrician magistracy was merely an historical reminiscence; it designated the offices from which the plebeians had formerly been excluded. The term plebeian magistracy, on the other hand, continued to express a fact; the offices of tribune and of plebeian aedile were never thrown open to the patricians.</p>
 <p>2. <title>The Relation of the different Magistrates to each other</title> was not determined, at Rome, by assigning to each office special and distinct powers and duties; nor were the different magistrates protected against each other's interference. The earliest magistrates, the consuls, held an undifferentiated complex of military, judicial, and administrative powers; and the creation of new magistracies was not at first accompanied (except in the case of the censors) by any logical separation of these powers. The trend of development, especially in the later Republic, was towards a division of <seg lang="la">provinciae</seg> or spheres of power; but the separation never became complete. Powers of interference were so general as to amount to a fundamental principle of the constitution—a principle which found its extreme expression in the tribunate.</p>
 <p>The Romans themselves classed their magistrates not according to the kind of power, but according to the degree of power, which each exercised. Their term for general power was <seg lang="la">imperium.</seg> The dictator and his lieutenant, the consuls and the praetors, all had imperium. The consular imperium was <seg lang="la">minus</seg> as regarded the dictator and his lieutenant, <seg lang="la">maius</seg> as compared with that of the praetors. The other magistrates (censors, tribunes, aediles, quaestors, etc.) had not imperium—i. e. their powers were not general, but special. These, therefore, strictly speaking, were all lower or lesser <cb /> magistrates (<seg lang="la">magistratus minores</seg>). The censors, however, by reason of the importance of their duties, were regularly classed among the <seg lang="la">magistratus maiores;</seg> and so also, on more technical grounds, were the curule aediles.</p>
 <p><title>Maior potestas.</title> In principle, any magistrate with imperium might issue commands and prohibitions to any magistrate without imperium. The exceptions to this rule were as follows: neither the tribunes nor the censors were subject to the commands or prohibitions of the magistrates with imperium; and the tribunes might intervene negatively, by prohibitions, against the acts of all magistrates except the dictator, his lieutenant, and the censors. The exceptional position of the censors was due to their possession of a distinct field of duties. They had no occasion to interfere with other magistrates, and no other magistrates were permitted to interfere with them. The peculiar position of the tribunes was a survival from the period of the conflict between the orders. Negatively the tribunes had <seg lang="la">maior potestas</seg> as against the consuls; but no Roman would have so expressed it, for the Romans meant by <seg lang="la">potestas</seg> power to act rather than power to prevent.</p>
 <p>In principle, again, a magistrate with <seg lang="la">maius imperium</seg> might issue commands to a magistrate with <seg lang="la">minus imperium;</seg> so that a dictator might command and restrain a consul, and a consul might similarly direct or check a praetor.</p>
 <p><title>Par potestas.</title> Further possibilities of interference resulted from the fact that every magistracy except the dictatorship was held by two or more persons. Between such colleagues there was, in principle, no division of power; each possessed all the powers of the office. Each, therefore, might act alone, and without regard to the views or wishes of his colleague or colleagues; and if they remained passive, his act was valid and effective. But if a colleague stepped in (<seg lang="la">intercessit</seg>) and forbade the act, then equal power stood opposed to equal power and the result was a deadlock. This was true not merely as between two colleagues, but also when a larger number held the same magistracy; majority rule was not recognized; the negative will of one was as powerful as the positive will of any larger number. A veto, therefore, could not be vetoed—a rule which was of peculiar importance in the tribunate. In that body one tribune could prevent the other nine from doing any positive act—e. g. from presenting a bill to the people; but nine tribunes could not prevent one from vetoing the act of a consul or other magistrate.</p>
 <p><title>Provinciae.</title> In principle, therefore, the positive powers of each magistracy could be exercised only when the colleagues were of one mind; and this unanimity was necessary for each single act. In fact, however, some division of power, by agreement or by lot, was customary from the earliest period of the Republic (e. g. one consul sometimes took the field with an army while the other governed the city); but it does not appear that in the early Republic any such division of the field of consular duties was made for the year. The assignment to a single magistrate of a distinct field of power for his full annual term apparently dates from the establishment of the praetorship. The praetor was not simply a judicial officer, nor was his authority limited to the city; but by force of constant custom civil jurisdiction within the city 
<pb n="995" /><cb />
 became his peculiar “province.” When a second praetorship was instituted, B.C. 242, a division of the judicial field became usual; but the assignment to each praetor of his special competence was made after election and by lot. The same system prevailed when the number of praetors was successively increased to four, six, and eight, and when such distinct functions as the government of subject provinces and the presidency of special criminal courts (<seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>) were attached to the office. No Roman was ever elected to a special praetorship; he was simply elected praetor, and his special duties were determined by lot. The same system was extended to the quaestors, and gradually, in the later Republic, to the consuls. For some time after the establishment of the city praetorship the consuls acted jointly. They even took the field together, the supreme command alternating day by day. But as foreign wars became more numerous they began, often by the advice of the Senate, but technically, in every case, by agreement, to divide the legions and the field of military operations, and to draw lots for their respective armies and “provinces.” The Senate indeed might recommend or the people decree the assignment of a particular campaign or territory to a particular magistrate <seg lang="la">extra sortem;</seg> but this was unusual.</p>
 <p>From the fact that all magistrates of equal rank were colleagues with equal powers and that the division of functions here described was primarily a <seg lang="la">de facto</seg> rather than a legal division, it followed, in principle, that either consul could interfere with the other in the field of military operations, and that any praetor could intercede against the act of any other praetor in the city. Such interference was practically impossible outside of the city, if different fields of activity had been assigned to the consuls, because of the rule that intercession must be made in person; and within the city it was regularly excluded by custom (but see Cicero, <title>Verr.</title> i. 46, 119).</p>
 <p>3. <title>Powers of the Magistrates.</title> The imperium conferred upon the higher magistrates was, in principle, the same sort of power that had been exercised by the kings (<seg lang="la">imperium regium</seg>). It was primarily military power (<seg lang="la">imperium militiae</seg>), and was understood to include all governmental power not distinctly withheld by custom or law. Special limitations were first imposed in the field of justice, criminal and civil. The royal power of capital punishment has been practically annulled, according to Roman tradition, by the recognition of a right to appeal to the assembly (<seg lang="la">provocatio</seg>); and in the early Republican period this power passed wholly to the people, the magistrate retaining only the power to investigate and accuse. The power of the magistrates to fine was also limited by law. Civil cases were regularly referred, for decision, to a private <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> or <seg lang="la">arbiter</seg>, or a board of elected <seg lang="la">iudices.</seg> All these limitations, however, were confined to the city; and the restrictions afterwards imposed upon imperium out of the city (e. g. right of appeal in capital cases) were less extensive. Outside of the city, moreover, the magistrates with imperium were freed from the interference of the tribunes. The Romans accordingly came to distinguish <seg lang="la">imperium militiae</seg> from <seg lang="la">imperium domi</seg>, the complete power exercised beyond the city limits from the restricted power exercised within the city. The dictator alone had <seg lang="la">imperium militiae</seg> <cb /> within the city—i. e. by the appointment of a dictator the city was placed under martial law.</p>
 <p>Practically, of course, the governmental power of the higher magistracy was lessened by the multiplication of magistrates, by their short terms of office, and by their accountability to the people after the expiration of their terms. The power of the single magistrates was also practically diminished, in the later Republic, by the assignment of special fields of action to special magistrates; but in spite of all these facts, no magistrate clothed with imperium was ever regarded as an officer of special, designated powers. Imperium was always, in theory, general power; and every magistrate with imperium had, as against the people, all powers not legally denied him. The consuls, by virtue of their higher imperium, had residuary governmental power, not only as against the people, but also as against the magistrates with lower imperium and those without imperium—i. e. a consul could do whatever law and custom had neither forbidden to him nor assigned to the exclusive competence of another magistrate.</p>
 <p><title>Special powers</title> included in imperium, many of which were exercised also by magistrates without imperium, were as follows: (1) <title>Ius agendi cum populo</title>—i. e. the right of summoning and presiding over the meetings of the people (<seg lang="la">comitia centuriata</seg>), submitting proposals to them, causing a vote to be taken and announcing the result. Whether the business of the meeting was legislation, criminal justice, or the election of magistrates for the ensuing year, the initiative was wholly in the magistracy. The magistrates determined the form of a bill and accepted or rejected proposed amendments. They decided whether accusation should be brought against a person suspected of crime, and what penalty the people should be asked to impose. They submitted the list of candidates to be voted for, and no names could be brought before the people without their assent. This <seg lang="la">ius agendi cum populo</seg> belonged exclusively to the magistrates with imperium. The tribunes, however, had similar control over the meetings of the plebeians; and when the <seg lang="la">concilia plebis</seg> had developed into the <seg lang="la">comitia tributa</seg> and had obtained concurrent powers of legislation, a limited criminal jurisdiction and the right of electing the lower magistrates, the <seg lang="la">ius agendi cum plebe</seg> gave the tribunes an initiative similar to that of the consuls and praetors. The analogous right of summoning the Senate and obtaining an expression of its opinion, originally an exclusive right of the magistrates with imperium, was also extended to the tribunes. In the field of legislation the power of the tribunate thus became legally equivalent to that of the magistrates with imperium. Practically it was greater; for if a consul or a praetor proposed a bill to the popular assembly or a resolution to the Senate, the tribunes could veto the proposal and thus arrest legislative action, while they themselves were not subject to such interference from the other magistrates. It is therefore not surprising that the most important laws of the later Republic were <hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi> proposed by the tribunes.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>Ius edicendi.</title> The people alone could establish a law (<seg lang="la">lex</seg>); but all magistrates had power to issue commands and prohibitions (<seg lang="la">edicta, interdicta</seg>) and means of punishing disobedience. Their ordinances, therefore, had the force of law (<seg lang="la">legis vicem</seg>), at least during the terms of the magistrates who 
<pb n="996" /><cb />
 issued them. In principle there was nothing to prevent a magistrate from invading by his edicts the field of general legislation. In the later Republic the development and the reform of the private law were chiefly accomplished by the edicts of the praetors, and important contributions to the law of sale were made by the aediles. As a rule, however, the ordinances of the magistrates were not intended to override the general law, but to secure its observance; and the edicts and interdicts of each set of magistrates were commonly confined to that sphere of administration which law and custom allotted them.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <title>Ius coercendi.</title> The means by which the magistrates enforced obedience to their commands were as follows: (<seg lang="la">a) prensio</seg>, arrest; (<seg lang="la">b) in vincula ductio</seg>, imprisonment; (<seg lang="la">c) verberatio</seg>, scourging; (<seg lang="la">d) multae dictio</seg>, imposition of a fine; (<seg lang="la">e) pignoris captio</seg>, seizure of movable property. All of these powers were included in imperium; the second and third were accorded only to magistrates with imperium. Imprisonment ordered by a magistrate was probably limited to his term of office; from a sentence of scourging <seg lang="la">in urbe</seg> a <title>lex Valeria</title> authorized an appeal to the people. The power to arrest was held by the tribunes and by the censors. The powers of fining and of seizing property were apparently exercised by all the magistrates, and constituted the ordinary and normal method of coercion. That it was a very ancient method is shown by numerous Aryan analogies, and by the fact that among the Romans fines were originally levied in sheep and oxen. The power to fine was first limited by the rule that the fine must not exceed the half of the estate of the delinquent; later laws (<title>Aeternia Tarpeia, Menenia Sestia</title> [?]) confined <seg lang="la">multae dictio</seg> to a definite maximum (two sheep and thirty oxen; two sheep and five oxen. For an ingenious explanation of these numbers, see Karlowa, pp. 167- 169). The magistrate who wished to fine beyond the legal maximum had to obtain the consent of the assembly (<seg lang="la">multae irrogatio</seg>). By the <title>lex Iulia Papiria</title> money fines were introduced and a pecuniary maximum substituted, the sheep being reckoned at ten as, the ox at one hundred. <title>Pignoris captio</title>, like imprisonment, might be employed to secure the payment of a fine; but it was often (and perhaps originally) used as a milder means of constraint, the property being restored to the owner if he promptly purged himself of contempt and subjected himself to the commands of the magistrate.</p>
 <p>The fact that the tribunes could arrest (<seg lang="la">prendere</seg>) other magistrates, while the <seg lang="la">leges sacratae</seg> protected them against all coercion, was the key to their peculiar position in the Roman State.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <title>Auspicia.</title> Before taking any important step, it was the right and the duty of the magistrates to ascertain whether the act in contemplation was favoured by the gods. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugur">Augur</ref>.) The magistrate who acted without proper auspices, or in defiance of unfavourable auspices, took the risk of punishment at the end of his term; and if his act was of a legal nature (e. g. the calling of <seg lang="la">comitia</seg>), it was the right and duty of the Senate, after obtaining the expert opinion of the augurs, to rescind the act and annul its results (e. g. the passage <ref id="n3" target="ref3"><seg lang="la"></seg><title></title></ref> <cb /> of a <seg lang="la">lex</seg> or the choice of magistrates). Auspices were regularly taken, at least in the earlier Republic, by the augurs; but the answer of the gods, as interpreted by these priests, referred to the inquiry of the magistrate at whose instance the auspices were taken. It was, of course, possible that the gods should be consulted on the same matter by different magistrates, and that different answers should be obtained. The result was then determined by the relative authority of the magistrates: <seg lang="la">maiora auspicia</seg> (i. e. auspices taken at the instance of a magistrate with <seg lang="la">maior potestas</seg>) overrode <seg lang="la">minora.</seg> As between colleagues with <seg lang="la">par potestas</seg>, unfavourable auspices prevailed over those of a favourable character.</p>
 <p>It is a plausible hypothesis that in the early Republic, when the entire constitution had a sacral colour, the doctrine of <seg lang="la">maior</seg> and <seg lang="la">par potestas</seg> was worked out by the priests in the form of a doctrine of auspices. It accords with this theory that the lower patrician magistrates were under the auspices of the higher, and that the non-magistrate, who exercised delegated powers, was said to act under the auspices of the magistrate who appointed him.</p>
 <p>4. <title>Responsibility.</title> The lower magistrates, as we have seen, were generally subject to the control of the higher, and the higher magistrates to the negative control of the tribunate; but the magistracy, as a whole, was not subject to the direct control of the people, or even to the control of the law. It enjoyed regal irresponsibility. During their terms of office the higher magistrates could not be made defendants in civil actions (<seg lang="la">in ius vocari</seg>), nor could criminal proceedings be instituted against them. In the later Republic magistrates were occasionally deposed by a vote of the assembly which had created them, but such action was contrary to the spirit of the constitution.</p>
 <p>An indirect control of a moral character was exercised by the <seg lang="la">consilia</seg> of the magistrates (see below) and by the Senate (q. v.); and a very strong indirect control lay in the unlimited responsibility of the magistrates after their terms of office had expired. Not only did they then become liable to ordinary civil and criminal proceedings, but they might be punished by the people on purely political grounds.</p>
 <p>5. <title>Expenses.</title> The republican magistrates received no pay; the technical term for office was <hi rend="italic">honour;</hi> but they were not expected to waste their substance in the service of the State. They were provided with an ample force of paid assistants and attendants. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapparitores">Apparitores</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossscribae">Scribae</ref>.) If their duties called them out of the city, they received a liberal outfit from the treasury, and were entitled to transportation and sustenance <seg lang="la">sumptu publico.</seg> What they could not obtain by requisition from the subjects of Rome, they paid for; and for such outlays they were reimbursed from the treasury. In the later Republic it was not unusual to grant round sums by way of allowance for expenses, without requiring any account to be rendered.</p>
 <p>6. <title>Insignia, attendants</title>, etc. The quasi-royal position held by the magistrates was strikingly expressed in the ceremonial and formal distinctions accorded them. The years were designated by the names of the consuls. The higher magistrates were accompanied, within and without the city, by numerous public attendants. Before the 
<pb n="997" /><cb />
 highest magistrates, those clothed with imperium, marched lictors, bearing the symbols of punitive power. When a magistrate approached, the citizens rose from their seats, dismounted from their horses, descended from their carriages. The lower magistrates observed the same respect towards those of higher authority. Public business was transacted by a seated magistracy in the presence of a standing people. Magistrates who acted singly had chairs or stools (<seg lang="la">sellae</seg>); those who, like the tribunes, acted collectively, as a board, sat on benches (<seg lang="la">subsellia</seg>). The higher magistrates had stools of a special pattern (the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>), and their garments were distinguished from those of the ordinary citizens. On ceremonial occasions ex-magistrates were permitted to resume the distinctive apparel of their office, and it was ostentatiously associated with their memory by their descendants (<seg lang="la">ius imaginum</seg>). For details, see <ref type="cross" target="crossapparitores">Apparitores</ref>; Insignia.</p>
 <p>7. <title>Consilia.</title> It was a principle of Roman law, private and public, that he who exercised power over others should not act unadvised. It was equally a principle of the law that advice was not binding. The power to act was not impaired by the dissent of advisers, nor did their assent diminish or divide responsibility.</p>
 <p>The Senate, which had been the council of the kings, was also, in a broad sense, the council of the whole higher magistracy; but each magistrate had a special <seg lang="la">consilium.</seg> This always included any lower magistrates who were assigned to the same “province,” or field of administration, and the principal assistants or deputies selected by the magistrate himself; but it also included persons chosen by him as advisers simply. The choice was limited, by custom, to the senatorial and equestrian orders. It was often based on personal friendship, but chiefly on the reputation of the persons chosen for knowledge and experience of affairs. In the administration of justice the urban and peregrine praetors and the provincial governors were regularly assisted by the counsel of the most eminent Roman jurists.</p>
 <p>8. <title>Election, terms</title>, etc. All the magistrates, except the dictator, were elected (<seg lang="la">creati</seg>) by the people; the higher magistrates, including the censors and curule aediles, by the <seg lang="la">comitia centuriata;</seg> the tribunes, plebeian aediles, quaestors, vigintisexviri, curatores, and military tribunes, by the <seg lang="la">comitia tributa.</seg> All except the censors were elected annually; the censors every fifth year. All were elected during the year preceding their assumption of office, the magistrates in office (consuls, praetors, or tribunes) summoning and directing the <seg lang="la">comitia</seg> in which their successors were chosen. The election of tribunes took place in July; that of the other magistrates later in the year. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.</p>
 <p>The term of office, except in the case of the dictator and in that of the censors, was one year. The dictatorship was limited to six months. The censors originally held office until their work was done; later, the rule was established that their work must be done in eighteen months. The annual terms, in the early Republic, did not begin at any fixed date; in case of abdication or death of both consuls, their successors were chosen, not for the residue of the term, but for a full year. In the later Republic the practice was changed; at the close of the third century B.C. the official <cb /> year began on the 15th of March; in the second century it began on the 1st of January. The quaestors, however, took office December 5th, and the tribunes December 10th.</p>
 <p><title>Lex curiata de imperio.</title> According to Roman tradition, the king-elect had no imperium until it was granted him by a special law. Under the Republic the consuls and praetors, at the beginning of their terms of office, were obliged to summon the old patrician assembly (<seg lang="la">comitia curiata</seg>) and obtain from it a similar grant. The necessary law seems always to have been voted as a matter of course; and in the late Republic its adoption was a singularly empty form, the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg> being represented by lictors. At some intermediate period the theory that a formal grant of power should follow election and accompany the assumption of office was extended to some of the officials without imperium—e. g. a <seg lang="la">lex curiata</seg> was regularly passed for the benefit of the quaestors. In the case of the censors, a law authorizing them to enter upon the discharge of their duties was voted by the centuriate assembly. No <seg lang="la">lex curiata</seg> or other confirmatory law was ever passed in the case of the plebeian magistrates.</p>
 <p>9. <title>Eligibility </title> (<seg lang="la">ius honorum</seg>). The power of the magistrates to strike unfit persons from the list of candidates could never have been exercised on purely political grounds without serious risk of subsequent punishment; and in the course of the republican period the grounds of exclusion were defined, by custom or statute, with considerable exactness. Non-citizens, lunatics, and persons afflicted with serious bodily infirmities were, of course, excluded; so also were women. Condemnation for political offences (and for ordinary crimes and torts when the condemnation carried with it <seg lang="la">infamia</seg>) operated as a bar to office; and it lay in the power of the magistrate to exclude those whose occupations made them infamous. Freedmen and their sons were ineligible, and originally their grandsons also; but in the later Republic the grandsons were eligible. Tradesmen were regularly excluded, trade on a small scale being regarded as an illiberal occupation.</p>
 <p>At different periods in the history of the Republic candidacy for office was made conditional on the previous performance of military duty, upon the observance of a definite order of advancement with intervals between the different offices, and upon the attainment of certain age limits. For details, see <ref type="cross" target="crosshonores">Honores</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Re-election.</title> As early as B.C. 342 a plebiscite forbade re-election to the same office until ten years had elapsed; but from this rule frequent dispensations seem to have been granted. Re-election to the censorship was absolutely forbidden. In the year B.C. 151 the same rule was established for the consulate, but it was abrogated seventy years later.</p>
 <p>10. <title>Vacancies and Representatives.</title> The fact that every magistracy was held by a number of persons, each of whom possessed all the powers of the office, and the further fact that the consuls possessed residuary governmental power, excluded the assumption that a vacancy was created by the death or resignation of any single magistrate. Even when a distinct field of administration had been allotted to such a magistrate, his duties could be assigned to a colleague or assumed by one of the consuls. Cases even occurred where 
<pb n="998" /><cb />
 the duties associated with one magistracy were temporarily assigned by the Senate to another (e. g. duties of an aedile to a praetor).</p>
 <p>The death or abdication of both consuls (if at the time there was no dictator) meant more than a mere vacancy in the consular office: it meant the temporary disappearance of the ordinary government. By the sacral tradition praetors, curule aediles, and even quaestors were bound to resign their offices; the auspices under which they held their respective positions were extinguished, and it was necessary to institute a new administration with new auspices. The situation was the same as that produced in the royal period by the death of the king: there was an <seg lang="la">interregnum.</seg> As in the royal period, the auspices were with the Senate, and the Senate designated the temporary holders of supreme power—one <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi> after another, each holding for five days—until the centuries could be assembled and new magistrates elected. As soon as a single consul was chosen, the <seg lang="la">interregnum</seg> was at an end. The <seg lang="la">interregnum</seg> exercised no influence upon the plebeian magistrates, for they were not under the same auspices.</p>

According to the official theory, promulgated by Augustus and accepted by his successors, the establishment of the <seg lang="la">principatus</seg> left the republican constitution intact, and in the early Empire republican forms were scrupulously observed. The magistrates were elected, during the reign of Augustus, by the people; under Tiberius and his successors they were “created” by the Senate and “announced” in the popular assembly. Under both systems they were selected by the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, and however independent they might be in theory, in fact they were unable to cross the imperial purposes. They were not, however, the real agents of the imperial government. The emperors preferred to exercise the more important powers of sovereignty through officers whom they appointed openly and directly, and whose authority was theoretically as well as actually a delegated authority. The real officials of the Empire were the prefects and legates of Augustus. The republican magistrates were loaded with honours, but they were quietly deprived, from the start, of all their political powers and confined to the exercise of judicial and administrative functions; and, later on, these functions also were gradually absorbed by the imperial officials—police powers and criminal justice first, minor administrative duties and civil jurisdiction last. The development of the new official hierarchy was practically completed in the second century. The republican magistracies became mere titles, earned by heavy outlays for the amusement of the people. In this form they continued to exist throughout the principate, and were even transferred to the Eastern Empire. Allusions to the tribunate occur in the fifth century; and as late as 541 an “Oriental consul” was elected at Constantinople, and for a quarter of a century the years were officially dated from his consulate.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. Municipal Magistrates</hi>. With the development of self-governing colonies and the extension to allied and subject cities of Roman citizenship and municipal autonomy, there appeared, at <cb /> the close of the republican period, a municipal magistracy closely modelled on that of Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmunicipium">Municipium</ref>.) Under the principate, this system, first worked out for Italy, was gradually extended throughout the Empire, until the municipal magistrates became everywhere the regular organs of local government. In the legal literature of the Empire, therefore, <seg lang="la">magistratus</seg> regularly refers to the municipal magistracy, the titular dignitaries of Rome being distinguished as <title>magistratus populi Romani.</title></p>

<div2 id="crossmaiestas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Maiestas">Maiestas</head>

 <p> in Roman criminal law, meant the inviolable dignity or sovereignty of the State; and all conduct derogatory to the dignity or power of the people, or of those to whom the people had intrusted power, was <seg lang="la">crimen imminutae maiestatis</seg> ( <title>De Invent.</title> ii. 17, 53). This particular conception of treason appeared late in the history of the Republic, and was at first supplementary to the older conception of <seg lang="la">perduellio.</seg> An attack upon the existence of the State was <seg lang="la">perduellio;</seg> anything less than this was the crime of impaired majesty. The Republican laws <seg lang="la">de maiestate</seg> were all passed in a period of bitter, and often bloody, political strife, and all the prosecutions under these laws were essentially partisan. The expression <seg lang="la">imminuta maiestas</seg> seems first to have been used in the <title>lex Apuleia</title> (B.C. 103?); and the principal object of this law, apparently, was to protect the sovereignty of the people as incorporated in the tribunate. The conception was further developed by a <title>lex Varia</title> (B.C. 90?) and (in the conservative interest) by a <title>lex Cornelia</title> of Sulla (B.C. 80), until the crime against majesty practically covered and included <seg lang="la">perduellio.</seg> In a <title>lex Iulia</title> (ascribed by some authorities to Julius Caesar, by others to Augustus, while others again hold that there were two <title>leges Iuliae de maiestate</title>), the two crimes were fused, and <seg lang="la">perduellio</seg> thenceforward meant simply a grave case of lese-majesty (cf. <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>3</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 1</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 5</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 48, 4, 11; Codex, 9, 50, 2). This <title>lex Iulia</title> remained the basis of the law of treason through the Imperial period, but the number of possible offences against majesty was greatly increased by succeeding statutes. The <seg lang="la">maiestas publica</seg> was primarily and chiefly embodied in the person of the emperor (<seg lang="la">maiestas principatus, augusta</seg>); and the <seg lang="la">crimen laesae maiestatis</seg> included not only acts injurious to the State, but all plots against the emperor and his family, and all acts derogatory to his dignity and honour. Thus libels upon the emperor, destruction of his statues, false or violated oaths <seg lang="la">per genium principis</seg>, and, under some of the more tyrannic rulers, hostile and even disrespectful speech were punished as lesemajesty. Arcadius, who repealed all laws of the last-mentioned character, extended the law of treason to include plots against the higher officials of the Empire (A.D. 397). <cb /></p>
 <p>Trials for <seg lang="la">perduellio</seg>, under the Republic, were always <seg lang="la">in comitiis</seg>—i. e. prosecution took the form of a bill, and the decision lay with the popular assembly. Prosecutions <seg lang="la">de maiestate</seg>, on the other hand, were conducted before special courts (<seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>). In the early Imperial period cases of treason were tried by the Senate; later by the emperor himself or his praefects. Accusation could be brought, even under the Republic, by slaves, infamous persons, and others who were debarred in ordinary criminal cases; and under the emperors torture was applied to freemen and even to persons of rank (<seg lang="la">honorati</seg>) for the purpose of obtaining evidence.</p>
 <p>The penalty in the Republican period was exile, or rather outlawry (<seg lang="la">aquae et ignis interdictio</seg>). In the Empire it varied, according to the gravity of the offence, the social position of the offender, and the temper of the reigning emperor, from death in various forms (<seg lang="la">humiliores vestiis obiiciuntur vel vivi exuruntur, honestiores capite puniuntur</seg>, Paul, v. 29, 1) to scourging or simple <seg lang="la">relegatio.</seg> In both periods the extreme penalty carried with it the escheat or confiscation of the criminal's property, and, under the Empire, attainder of the blood, so that the sons of the criminal could neither hold office nor take inheritances or legacies (Codex, 9, 8, 5). The same results attached to condemnation when prosecution was instituted after the death of the criminal (<seg lang="la">damnatio memoriae</seg>).

 <p>A Roman who was consul in B.C. 137. He was defeated by the Numantines, and purchased his safety by making a peace with them. The Senate refused to recognize it, and went through the hypocritical ceremony of delivering him over to the enemy, who refused to accept him. On his return to Rome he was expelled from the Senate by the tribune P. Rutilius on the ground that he had lost his citizenship, as being still technically a prisoner (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspostliminium">Postliminium</ref>); but his rights were restored by a special law (Vell.

 <p> (from <hi rend="italic">manus + capio</hi>, “a taking with the hand”). A formal mode of purchase among the Romans, which seems to go back to a time when the price of purchase was weighed out in bars of copper. In the presence of six Roman citizens of the age of puberty, one of whom, called the <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi> (weigher), held a copper balance, the purchaser took hold of the thing and uttered certain prescribed words. He then struck the balance (<seg lang="la">libra</seg>) with a small piece of copper (<seg lang="la">aes</seg> or <seg lang="la">raudusculum</seg>), which he gave to the seller as symbol of the price. This mode of purchase <seg lang="la">per aes et libram</seg> was employed in the case of <seg lang="la">res mancipi</seg>—i. e. estates in Italy or provinces with Italian law, in the country or in towns, slaves, and domestic animals and beasts of burden needed for agricultural purposes; also in a certain kind of testaments, in the form of marriage called <hi rend="italic">coëmptio</hi>, and in transferring one's power over a person (<seg lang="la">manus</seg>) to another.

For some years they were faithful allies of the Carthaginians; but in consequence of the generous treatment which the wife of Mandonius and the daughters of Indibilis received from P.

But in B.C. 206 the illness and reported death of Scipio gave them hopes of shaking off the yoke of Rome, and they excited a general revolt not only among their own subjects, but the neighbouring Celtiberian tribes also. They were defeated by Scipio, and upon suing for forgiveness were pardoned. But when Scipio left Spain in the next year (B.C. 205) they again revolted.

 <p> (from <seg lang="la">mānus</seg>, “good”). A name euphemistically given by the Romans to the spirits of the dead, which were held to be immortal like the gods, and hence designated as such (<seg lang="la">dii manes</seg>). They dwelt below the earth, and only came forth at certain seasons of the year. On the Mons Palatinus at Rome, there was, as in other Italian towns, a deep pit with the shape of an inverted sky, known as <seg lang="la">mundus</seg>, the lowest part of which was consecrated to the infernal gods and also to the Manes, and was closed with a stone, <seg lang="la">lapis manalis</seg>, thought to be the gate of the nether world. This stone was lifted up three times a year (August 24, October 5, November 8), and the Manes were then believed to rise to the upper world; on this account those days were <seg lang="la">religiosi</seg>—i. e. no serious matter might be undertaken on them. Sacrifices were made to the Manes as to the dead; water, wine, warm milk, honey, oil, and the blood of black <cb /> sheep, pigs, and oxen were poured on the grave; ointments and incense were offered; and the grave was decked with flowers, roses and violets by preference. Oblations, which chiefly consisted of beans, eggs, lentils, bread and wine, were placed on the grave, and the mourners partook of a meal in its neighbourhood. Besides the private celebrations there was also a public and universal festival, the Parentalia, which lasted from the 13th to the 21st of February, the last month of the older Roman year; the last day had the special name Feralia. During these days all the temples were closed, marriages were prohibited, and the magistrates had to appear in public without the tokens of their office. The festival of the dead was followed by that of the relations on February 22, called <ref type="cross" target="crosscaristia">Caristia</ref> (q.v.). This was celebrated throughout the town by each individual family, the members of which exchanged presents and met at festal banquets.

An Egyptian, a priest at Heliopolis in the reign of the first Ptolemy (B.C. 283-246), and who was the first Egyptian to give in Greek an account of the history and religion of his native country. One work was entitled <foreign lang="greek">Τῶν Φυσικῶν Ἐπιτομή</foreign>, dealing with the theology of the Egyptians and with the origin of the world; the second was styled <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγυπτιακὴ Ἱστορία</foreign>, and in three books treated of Aegyptian chronology and history. The first book covers the mythical period prior to the eleventh dynasty; the second, from the eleventh to the twentieth; the third, from the twentieth dynasty to the reign of Nectanebus, the last native Egyptian king. The original works of Manetho are lost, but copious extracts remain preserved by the ecclesiastical writers, especially Iulius Africanus, Eusebius , and Georgius Syncellus. The sources of Manetho's history were the early archives and sacred books of Egypt, and in recent years much corroborative evidence of the truth of what he wrote has been derived by Egyptologists from the hieroglyphics and other sources. The fragments of Manetho are collected and edited by C. Müller in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> (Paris, 1856)</bibl>.

The author certainly intended to write a sixth book, but it has either been lost or was never written. The poet, who shows extensive knowledge, frequently boasts of having been the first among Roman poets to treat the subject, and handles his difficult theme with a dexterity and a moral earnestness that recall Lucretius, whose language he has frequently imitated.

In 385 he defended the cause of the plebeians, who were suffering severely from the harsh and cruel treatment of their patrician creditors. In the following year he was charged with high treason by the patricians; and being condemned to death by the people, he was hurled down the Tarpeian Rock by the tribunes.

<head orig="Mantĭké">Mantike</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μαντική</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>). The name given by the Greeks to the gift or art of divination. The belief of the ancients that it was possible to find out what was hidden or what was going to happen sprang from the idea that the gods, when implored by prayer, or even when unimplored, graciously communicated revelations to men by means of direct inspiration or through signs requiring interpretation. Hence the ancients distinguished between natural and artificial divination.</p>
 <p>Divination is natural when a man receives the supposed inspiration in a dream or in an ecstatic state. The belief in divine inspiration in dreams is of the greatest antiquity, and continued to be held when the natural causes of dreams had been ascertained. The meaning of prophetic dreams cannot, however, always be immediately comprehended; they are mostly symbolical, and therefore require an interpretation. As a guide to this, there arose in the course of time certain rules resulting from experience, which produced a special art—that of interpreting dreams—of which some idea is given by the <foreign lang="greek">Ὀνειροκριτικά</foreign>, on the interpretation of dreams, by <ref type="cross" target="crossartemidorus">Artemidorus</ref> (q.v.). Similarly, the dreams obtained by sleeping at holy places (<seg lang="la">incubatio</seg>), which were always considered prophetic, usually needed a priest to interpret them.</p>
 <p>The power of more or less clearly seeing in waking hours things concealed from ordinary vision was believed by the Greeks to be a special gift of Apollo. It is from him that Homer makes Calchas receive his revelations, although no mention is made of his being in the ecstatic state usually connected with this kind of soothsaying. At the oracles this state was usually produced by external influences (see <ref type="cross" target="crossoracula">Oracula</ref>); women were held to be particularly susceptible to them. Besides oracles and persons reputed to be inspired, use 
<pb n="1003" /><cb />
 was made of various collections of older oracular sayings and pretended predictions of prophets and prophetesses of former times, such as the Branchidae of Miletus, the Iamidae of Olympia, the Eumolpidae of Athens, and the Sibyls. Such collections were not only in the possession of States and priesthoods, but also in that of private individuals, called <foreign lang="greek">χρησμολόγοι</foreign>, who drew on their store when paid to do so by those who believed in them, and often also explained the dark sayings. Like the prophets by immediate inspiration, those also were called seers who interpreted according to certain rules the divine signs which formed the subject of the artificial variety of the art of divination.</p>
 <p>From the very oldest times special importance was attached to omens of birds (whether in answer to prayer or not), which were discriminated from one another by various rules, with regard partly to the kind of birds, partly to the manner of their appearing—e. g. direction (favourable from the right, unfavourable from the left), flight, alighting, singing, and anything else they did. The principal birds consulted were the birds of prey that fly highest and alone—the eagle (the messenger of Zeus), the heron, the hawk, the falcon, and the vulture; in the case of ravens and crows, the cawing was an omen.</p>
 <p>Second in importance were the various phenomena of the sky considered as divine signs. Whether thunder and lightning were favourable or not was also decided by the direction, right or left, from which they came. At Sparta, shooting stars were thought to show that the gods were displeased with the kings. Eclipses of the sun and moon, comets, and meteors were signs that inspired terror. Prophesying from the stars, however, did not become known in Greece till the time of Alexander the Great.</p>
 <p>In important enterprises, especially in war, recourse was had to an examination of the condition of sacrificed animals or <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροσκοπία</foreign>—oxen, sheep, and also pigs being most frequently the victims. The points observed were: normal or abnormal nature of the entrails, especially the liver, with the gall-bladder, and also the heart, spleen, and lungs. The various kinds of entrails and their abnormal conditions were made the subject of a highly elaborate system, so that no Greek army could dispense with a skilled interpreter of signs. When the omens were unfavourable, the sacrifice was repeated till they were favourable, or the enterprise was postponed. The manner, too, in which animals went to be sacrificed, whether willingly or with reluctance ( <bibl n="Juv.  12. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xii. 5</bibl>, with Mayor's note), was looked upon as an omen, as also the way in which the sacrifice burned on the altar, the burning of the flame itself, the rising or sinking of the smoke, etc. These signs drawn from fire were the subject of <foreign lang="greek">πυρομαντεία</foreign>.</p>
 <p>There was, indeed, a general inclination to regard all striking and unusual events as hints from the gods, and to interpret them one's self, or to have them interpreted by skilled seers. From ancient times the chance utterances of others were thought to be prophetic in so far as they applied to the circumstances of the moment. For such omens also the gods were asked. Besides these, lots and dice were used for predictions. There were many other artificial varieties of the art of divination, some of them very strange, <cb /> which were in special favour in the lower classes of the people and in later times; as, for instance, soothsaying with a sieve suspended by threads, for the purpose of finding out thieves, or remedies for illness, etc., that name being thought the one required, at mention of which the sieve ceased to turn round. As early as Aristotle allusion is made to chiromancy, or palmistry.

<head orig="Manumissio">Manumissio</head>

 <p> The legal act by which slaves and persons <seg lang="la">in mancipii causa</seg> were released from the <seg lang="la">manus</seg> of their masters and presented with freedom. There were three kinds of manumission: (<seg lang="la">a) vindictā, (b) censu, (c) testamento</seg>, on which classification see <bibl n="Gaius  1. 17." default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, i. 17.</bibl></p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Manumissio by <seg lang="la">vindicta</seg> was probably the earliest form (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 5</bibl>), and was the assertion before a magistrate of the slave's freedom to which the owner made no defence, whereupon the magistrate declared the slave a freeman. The ceremony was as follows: The master brought his slave before the praetor, since it was his province to exercise jurisdiction in civil causcs. The praetor's lictor, who came to be used as <seg lang="la">adsertor libertatis</seg>, in order to save the trouble of bringing a person to take this part, holding a rod (<seg lang="la">vindicta</seg> or <seg lang="la">festuca</seg>) with one hand, and with the other laying hold of the slave, said, <title>Hunc ego hominem ex iure Quiritium liberum esse aio</title>, at the same time touching him with the rod; the master then using the same formalities, and turning the slave round and releasing his hold of him, as seems to have been the 
<pb n="1004" /><cb />
 custom ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 5. 78" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>v. 78</bibl>), admitted his freedom, either expressly or by his silence, which was followed by the <seg lang="la">pronuntiatio</seg> of the magistratus, <title>Quandoque Numerius Nigidius non contra vindicat, hunc ego hominem ex iure Quiritium liberum esse dico.</title></p>
 <p><title>Addicere</title> is the technical term to express this act of a magistrate by which he pronounced in favour of a right, in this case a right to freedom ( <title>Ad Att.</title> vii. 2). This form of manumission derived its name from the <seg lang="la">vindicta</seg> or rod, otherwise called <seg lang="la">festuca</seg>, which was used in the proceeding (Plaut. <bibl n="Asc. Mil. 4. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Mil.</title>iv. 1</bibl><bibl n="Asc. Mil. 15" default="NO" valid="yes"> Mil., 15</bibl>).</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Ulpian (1, 8) thus describes manumissio by the <seg lang="la">census:</seg> “Slaves were formerly manumitted by census, when at the lustral census (<seg lang="la">lustrali censu</seg>) at Rome they gave in their census at the bidding of their masters.” The slave must of course have had a sufficient <seg lang="la">peculium</seg>, or the master must have given him property, so that he might become a taxpayer.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The Twelve Tables confirmed freedom that was granted by will (<seg lang="la">testamento</seg>). There were three kinds of testamentary manumission—when the master freed the slave by will and made him a <seg lang="la">heres;</seg> when the master gave his slave his freedom as a direct legacy; and when a person requested his heir or legatee to manumit the slave.</p>
 <p>Manumission according to legal form not only freed a slave, but made him a citizen. There were other informal ways of manumitting—e. g. <seg lang="la">inter amicos</seg>, which was a declaration by the master in the presence of witnesses that the slave was free. An invitation to dinner sent to a slave was regarded as such a declaration. For restrictions on manumission, see <ref type="cross" target="crossservus">Servus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The legal act of manumission was often followed by a religious ceremony in the temple of Feronia, where the freedman appeared clad in the toga or dress of a Roman citizen, and with a <hi rend="italic">pileus</hi>, or particular kind of cap, on his shaven head. This last circumstance explains the expression <seg lang="la">servos ad pileum vocare</seg> ( <bibl n="Liv.  24. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxiv. 32</bibl>), which means to promise slaves their liberty in order to induce them to join in some civil disturbance (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Am. 3.4.16" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Amph.</title> iii. 4, 16</bibl>; <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5. 2.2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poen.</title>v. 2. 2</bibl>; <title>Ad Aen.</title> viii. 564). The <hi rend="italic">pileus</hi> was still worn in the time of Justinian, since he declares that slaves who attend the funeral of their master with the cap of freedom on their heads (<seg lang="la">pileati</seg>) become Roman citizens.

 <p> In its wider sense, the name given by the Romans to the power of the chief of a family over the whole of that family, especially the power of the husband over his wife, whose person and property were so completely his own that he was legally responsible for her actions, but at the same time had the right to kill, punish, or sell her. As in this respect, so also with respect to the right of inheritance, the wife was placed on a level with the children, as she obtained the same share as they.

 <p> (laying on of the hand). In the oldest Roman legal procedure a kind of execution levied on the person of one who had been condemned to pay a certain sum. If this was not done within thirty days of the condemnation, the plaintiff could seize the debtor and bring him before the praetor, who handed him over to the creditor <cb /> with the word <seg lang="la">addico</seg> (I hand over), unless he paid there and then, or a <seg lang="la">vindex</seg> came forward to pay for him or to show there was no ground for complaint. The creditor kept the debtor in chains at his house for sixty days; if his claims had not been satisfied during this period, he might kill him or sell him as a slave in foreign parts. From the fourth century on wards a less severe arrangement was usual; the relation of the <seg lang="la">addictus</seg> to his creditor was that of a <seg lang="la">homo liber in mancipio.</seg> See Bekker, <title>Die Actionen des röm.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μαραθών</foreign>). A deme of Attica, belonging to the tribe Leontis, was situated near a bay on the east coast of Attica, twenty-two miles from Athens by one road, and twenty-six miles by another. It originally belonged to the Attic tetrapolis, and is said to have derived its name from the hero Marathon. This hero, according to one account, was the son of Epopeus, king of Sicyon, who having been expelled from Peloponnesus by the violence of his father, settled in Attica; while, according to another account, he was an Arcadian who took part in the expedition of the Tyndaridae against Attica, and devoted himself to death before the battle.</p>
 <p>The site of the ancient town of Marathon was probably not at the modern village of Marathon, but at a place called Vraná, a little to the south of Marathon. Marathon was situated in a plain, which extends along the sea-shore, about six miles 
<pb n="1005" /><cb />
 in length, and from three miles to one mile and a half in breadth. It is surrounded on the other three sides by rocky hills and rugged mountains. Two marshes bound the extremity of the plain; the northern is more than a square mile in extent, but the southern is much smaller, and is almost dry at the conclusion of the great heats. Through the centre of the plain runs a small brook. In this plain was fought the celebrated battle between the Persians and Athenians, August 12th, B.C. 490. The Persians, numbering some 100,000 men, were drawn up on the plain, and the Athenians, 10,000 strong, under Miltiades, on some portion of the high ground above the plain; but the exact ground occupied by the two armies cannot be identified, notwithstanding the investigations of modern travellers. The Athenians lost 192 men, the Persians 6400. The tumulus or mound, raised over the Athenians who fell in the battle, is still to be seen. It is an isolated knoll in the plain, about 40 feet in height and 600 feet in circumference. Excavations made by Schliemann and others yielded nothing until 1890, when, under the direction of the Greek Archaeological Society, a number of vases of the fifth century B.C. and burned bones were found, undoubtedly those of the Athenians slain in the battle. The mound is now called the Sorós.

<head orig="Marcellus">Marcellus</head>

 <p> The name of an illustrious plebeian family of the Claudia gens. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Claudius Marcellus</hi>, celebrated as having been five times consul and commander of Syracuse. In his first consulship, B.C. 222, Marcellus distinguished himself by slaying in battle with his own hand Britomartius or Virdomarus, the king of the Insubrian Gauls, whose spoils he afterwards dedicated as <seg lang="la">spolia opima</seg> in the temple of Iupiter Feretrius. This was the third and last instance in Roman history in which such an offering was made. Marcellus was one of the chief Roman generals in the Second Punic War. He took Syracuse in B.C. 212, after a siege of more than two years, in which all his powerful military engines were rendered wholly unavailing by the superior skill and science of Archimedes, who directed those of the besieged. On the capture of the city Archimedes was one of the inhabitants slain by the Roman soldiers. Marcellus fell in battle against Hannibal in 208, and was buried by the enemy with military honours.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Claudius Marcellus</hi>, consul B.C. 51 and a bitter enemy of Caesar. In B.C. 46 he was pardoned by Caesar on the intercession of the Senate; whereupon Cicero returned thanks to Caesar in the oration <title>Pro Marcello</title>, which has come down to us. Marcellus, who was then living at Mitylené, set out on his return; but he was murdered at the Piraeus by one of his own attendants, P. Magius Chilo.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">C. Claudius Marcellus</hi>, brother of the preceding and also an enemy of Caesar. He <cb /> was consul in 49, when the Civil War broke out.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">C. Claudius Marcellus</hi>, first cousin of the two preceding and, like them, an enemy of Caesar. He was consul in 50, but he did not join Pompey in Greece, and was therefore readily pardoned by Caesar.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Claudius Marcellus</hi>, son of the preceding and of Octavia, the daughter of C. Octavius and sister of Augustus. He was born B.C. 43. Augustus, who had probably destined him for his successor, adopted him as his son, and gave him his daughter Iulia in marriage (B.C. 25). In 23 he was curule aedile, but died in the same year, to the great grief of Augustus as well as of his mother Octavia. The memory of Marcellus is immortalized by the well-known passage of Vergil ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 860" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>vi. 860</bibl>-886), which was recited by the poet to Augustus and Octavia.

In 451 Marcian assembled the Council of Chalcedon, in which the doctrines of the Eutychians were condemned. He died in 457, and was succeeded by Leo.</p>

<head orig="Marius">Marius</head>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, a distinguished Roman general and statesman, who was born near Arpinum in B.C. 157 of an obscure family in humble circumstances. His father's name was C. Marius, and his mother's Fulcinia; and his parents, as well as Marius himself, were clients of the noble plebeian house of the Herennii. So indigent, indeed, is the family represented to have been, that young Marius is said to have worked as a common peasant for wages, before he entered the ranks of the Roman army. (Cf. Juv. viii. 246.) The meanness of his origin has probably been somewhat exaggerated; but, at all events, he distinguished himself so much by his valour at the siege of Numantia in Spain (134) as to attract the notice of Scipio Africanus, who is said to have foretold his future greatness. His name does not occur again for fifteen years; but in 119 he was elected tribune of the plebs, when he was thirty-eight years of age. In this office he came forward as a popular leader, and proposed a law to give greater freedom to the people at the elections; and when the Senate attempted to overawe him, he commanded one of his officers to carry the consul Metellus to prison.</p>
 <p>Marius now became a marked man, and the aristocracy opposed him with all their might. He lost his election to the aedileship, and with difficulty obtained the praetorship; but he acquired influence and importance by his marriage with Iulia, the sister of C. Iulius Caesar, who was the father 
<pb n="1007" /><cb />
 of the future ruler of Rome. In 109 Marius crossed over into Africa as lieutenant of the consul Q. Metellus. Here, in the war against Iugurtha, the military genius of Marius had ample opportunity of displaying itself, and he was soon regarded as the most distinguished officer in the army. He also ingratiated himself with the soldiers, who praised him in the highest terms in their letters to their friends at Rome. His popularity became so great that he resolved to return to Rome, and become at once a candidate for the consulship; but it was with great difficulty that he obtained from Metellus permission to leave Africa. On his arrival at Rome he was elected consul with an enthusiasm which bore down all opposition before it; and he received from the people the province of Numidia and the conduct of the war against Iugurtha (107). On his return to Numidia he carried on the war with great vigour; and in the following year (106) Iugurtha was surrendered to him by the treachery of Bocchus, king of Mauretania. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossiugurtha">Iugurtha</ref>.) Marius sent his quaestor Sulla to receive the Numidian king from Bocchus. This circumstance sowed the seeds of the personal hatred which afterwards existed between Marius and Sulla , since the enemies of Marius claimed for Sulla the merit of bringing the war to a close by obtaining possession of the person of Iugurtha.</p>
 <p>Meantime Italy was threatened by a vast horde of barbarians, who had migrated from the north of Germany. The two leading nations of which they consisted were called Cimbri and Teutoni, the former of whom are supposed to have been Celts, and the latter Gauls. To these two great races were added the Ambrones, and some of the Swiss tribes, such as the Tigurini. The whole host is said to have contained three hundred thousand fighting men, besides a much larger number of women and children. They had defeated one Roman army after another, and it appeared that nothing could check their progress. The utmost alarm prevailed throughout Italy; all party quarrels were hushed. Every one felt that Marius was the only man capable of saving the State, and he was accordingly elected consul a second time during his absence in Africa. Marius entered Rome in triumph on the first of January, 104, the first day of his second consulship. Meanwhile, the threatened danger was for a while averted. Instead of crossing the Alps, the Cimbri marched into Spain, which they ravaged for the next two or three years. But as the return of the barbarians was constantly expected, Marius was elected consul a third time in 103, and a fourth time in 102. In the latter of these years the Cimbri returned into Gaul. The barbarians now divided their forces. The Cimbri marched round the northern foot of the Alps, in order to enter Italy by the northeast, crossing the Tyrolese Alps by the defiles of Tridentum (Trent). The Teutoni and Ambrones, on the other hand, marched against Marius, who had taken up a position in a fortified camp on the Rhône. The decisive battle was fought near Aquae Sextiae (Aix). The carnage was dreadful. The whole nation was annihilated, for those who did not fall in the battle put an end to their own lives. The Cimbri, meantime, had forced their way into Italy. Marius was elected consul a fifth time (101), and joined the proconsul Catulus in the north of Italy. The two <cb /> generals gained a great victory over the enemy on a plain called the Campi Raudii, near Vercellae (Vercelli). The Cimbri met with the same fate as the Teutoni; the whole nation was destroyed. Marius was received at Rome with unprecedented honours. He was hailed as the saviour of the State; his name was coupled with the gods in the libations and at banquets, and he received the title of third founder of Rome.</p>
 <p>Hitherto the career of Marius had been a glorious one; but the remainder of his life is full of <figure id="fig.01007">
<head orig="Gaius Marius. (Duruy.)">Gaius Marius. (Duruy.)</head>
</figure> horrors, and brings out the worst features of his character. In order to secure the consulship the sixth time, he entered into close connection with two of the worst demagogues that ever appeared at Rome, Saturninus and Glaucia. He gained his object, and was consul a sixth time in 100. In this year he drove into exile his old enemy Metellus; and shortly afterwards, when Saturninus and Glaucia took up arms against the State, Marius crushed the insurrection by command of the Senate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssaturninus">Saturninus</ref>.) His conduct in this affair was greatly blamed by the people, who looked upon him as a traitor to his former friends. For the next few years Marius took little part in public affairs. He possessed none of the qualifications which were necessary to maintain influence in the State during a time of peace, being an unlettered soldier, rude in manners, and arrogant in conduct. The Social War again called him into active service (90). He served as legate of the consul P. Rutilius Lupus; and after the latter had fallen in battle, he defeated the Marsi in two successive engagements. Marius was now sixtyseven, and his body had grown stout and unwieldy; but he was still as greedy of honour and distinction as he had ever been. He had set his heart upon obtaining the command of the war against Mithridates, which the Senate bestowed upon the consul Sulla at the end of the Social War (88). In order to gain his object, Marius allied himself to the tribune, P. Sulpicius Rufus, 
<pb n="1008" /><cb />
 who brought forward a law for distributing the Italian allies, who had just obtained the Roman franchise, among all the Roman tribes. As those new citizens greatly exceeded the old citizens in number, they would of course be able to carry whatever they pleased in the Comitia. The law was carried, notwithstanding the violent opposition of the consuls; and the tribes, in which the new citizens now had the majority, appointed Marius to the command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla fled to his army, which was stationed at Nola; and when Marius sent thither two military tribunes, to take the command of the troops, Sulla not only refused to surrender the command, but marched upon Rome at the head of his army. Marius was now obliged to take to flight. After wandering along the coast of Latium, and encountering terrible sufferings and privations, which he bore with unflinching fortitude, he was at length taken prisoner in the marshes formed by the river Liris, near Minturnae. The magistrates of this place resolved to put him to death, in accordance with a command which Sulla had sent to all the towns in Italy. A Gallic or Cimbrian soldier undertook to carry their sentence into effect, and with a drawn sword entered the apartment where Marius was confined. The part of the room in which Marius lay was in the shade; and to the frightened barbarian the eyes of Marius seemed to dart out fire, and from the darkness a terrible voice exclaimed, “Man, durst thou murder C. Marius?” The barbarian immediately threw down his sword, and rushed out of the house. Straightway there was a revulsion of feeling among the inhabitants of Minturnae. They got ready a ship, and placed Marius on board. He reached Africa in safety, and landed at Carthage; but he had scarcely put his foot on shore before the Roman governor sent an officer to bid him leave the country. This last blow almost unmanned Marius; his only reply was, “Tell the praetor that you have seen C. Marius a fugitive sitting on the ruins of Carthage.” Soon afterwards Marius was joined by his son, and they took refuge in the island of Cercina.</p>
 <p>During this time a revolution had taken place at Rome, in consequence of which Marius was enabled to return to Italy. The consul Cinna (87), who belonged to the Marian party, had been driven out of Rome by his colleague Octavius, and had subsequently been deprived by the Senate of the consulate. Cinna collected an army, and resolved to recover his honours by force of arms. As soon as Marius heard of these changes he left Africa, and joined Cinna in Italy. Marius and Cinna now laid siege to Rome. The failure of provisions compelled the Senate to yield, and Marius and Cinna entered Rome as conquerors. The most frightful scenes followed. The guards of Marius stabbed every one whom he did not salute, and the streets ran with the blood of the noblest of the Roman aristocracy. Among the victims of his vengeance were the great orator M. Antonius and his former colleague Q. Catulus. Without going through the form of an election, Marius and Cinna named themselves consuls for the following year (86). But he did not long enjoy the honour: he was now in his seventyfirst year; his body was worn out by the fatigues and sufferings he had recently undergone; and eighteen days after his assumption of the consulate he died of an attack of pleurisy.

<head orig="Mars">Mars</head>

 <p> (also <ref type="cross" target="crossmavors">Mavors</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossmamers">Mamers</ref>). After Iupiter the principal deity of the inhabitants of Italy, and therefore honoured with particular reverence by the Latins and Romans from the very earliest times, especially as the latter regarded him as the father of Romulus, the founder of Rome. He was held to be the son of Iuno, who bore him in consequence of touching a wonderful spring-flower, and the husband of Nerio or Neriené, a goddess of strength. Through the emphasizing of one of his attributes he gradually came to be considered as, above all, the god of war; for originally he was at the same time one of the mightiest gods of nature, the Vedic Marut, who accords fertility and protection to fields and herds.</p>
 <p>The first month of the old Roman year was dedicated to him as the fertilizing god of spring; in the very ancient chant of the Arval Brothers (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>), at the May-day festival of the Dea Dia, the help and protection of Mars were demanded. In earlier times he was also invoked at the hallowing of the fields (see <ref type="cross" target="crossambarvalia">Ambarvalia</ref>), that he might bless the family, the field, and the cattle, and keep off sickness, bad weather, and all else that did harm. (Cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossrobigus">Robigus</ref>.) In later times the names of Ceres and Bacchus were substituted for his on this particular occasion. At the festival on 15th October a horse was sacrificed to him to insure the fair growth of the seed that had been sown. As god of war (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossquirinus">Quirinus</ref>), his symbols were the ravenous wolf, the prophetic and warlike woodpecker, and the lance. When war broke out, the general solemnly invoked his aid, by smiting his holy lance and the holy shields (<seg lang="la">ancilia;</seg> see <ref type="cross" target="crosssalii">Salii</ref>) with the cry, “Mars, awake!” (<title>Mars vigila!</title>) Many sacrifices were also offered to him during the campaign and before battle; and in his <cb /> name military honours were conferred. The Field of Mars (Campus Martius) was dedicated to him as the patron god of warlike exercises; contests with battle-steeds, called Equirria, were there held in his honour on the 27th February, 14th March, and 15th October. On the last-mentioned day the horse on the right of the victorious team was sacrificed on his altar in the Field of Mars; it was known as the horse of October (<title>October equus</title>), and its blood was collected and preserved in the temple of Vesta, and used at the Palilia for purposes of purification. The cult of Mars was entrusted to a special priest, the flamen Martialis (see <ref type="cross" target="crossflamen">Flamen</ref>), and the college of the <ref type="cross" target="crosssalii">Salii</ref> (q.v.), which worshipped him more particularly as god of war. His principal festival was in March, the month sacred to him. As early as the time of King Tullus Hostilius, Pavor and Pallor (Fear and Pallor) are said to have been worshipped as his companions in the fight, in sanctuaries of their own. Augustus caused him to be honoured in a new form, as Mars Ultor (the avenger of Caesar), in the magnificent temple in the Forum Augusti, consecrated B.C. 2, where statues of him and of Venus, as the two divine ancestors of the Julian family, were set up. In later times he was identified completely with the Greek Ares. See <ref type="cross" target="crossares">Ares</ref>.

In B.C. 304, the Marsi, Peligni, and others concluded a peace with Rome, but later took a prominent part in the Social War for the Roman franchise, which from their bravery is often called the Marsic War.

 flute. Among the Phrygians the flute entered into the worship of Cybelé and Dionysus, and Marsyas is said to have instructed Olympus in playing upon that instrument. According to a Greek legend, Athené had invented the flute, and then cast it aside because it distorted the features of the player. Marsyas took it up, and became so skilful as to challenge Apollo, the patron god of the lyre. The Muses having declared him vanquished, the god flayed him; his skin was hung up in the cave from which the river Marsyas issued, and was said to move about joyfully when a flute was played. King Midas, who had decided in his favour, received as punishment from Apollo a pair of ass's ears. The contest was a favourite subject in art. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmidas">Midas</ref>.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Valerius</hi>, a writer of Latin epigrams, was born at Bilbilis in Spain, in the third year of Claudius, A.D. 43. He came to Rome in the thirteenth year of Nero, 66; and after residing in the metropolis thirty-five years, he returned to the place of his birth, in the third year of Trajan, 100. He lived there for upwards of three years at least, on the property of his wife, a lady named Marcella, whom he seems to have married after his return to Bilbilis. His death cannot have taken place before 104. His fame was extended, and his books were eagerly sought for not only in the city, but also in Gaul, Germany, and Britain; he secured the patronage of the emperors Titus and Domitian, obtained by his influence the freedom of the State for several of his friends, and received for himself, although apparently without family, the privileges accorded to those who were the fathers of three children (<seg lang="la">ius trium liberorum</seg>), together with the rank of tribune and the rights of the equestrian order. His circumstances appear to have been easy during his residence at Rome, for he had a mansion in the city, whose situation he describes, and a suburban villa near Nomentum, to which he frequently alludes with pride.</p>
 <p>The extant works of Martial consist of a collection of short poems, all included under the general appellation <title>Epigrammata</title>, upwards of 1500 in number, divided into fourteen books. Those which form the last two books, usually distinguished respectively as <title>Xenia</title> and <title>Apophoreta</title>, amounting to 350, consist of couplets, descriptive of a vast variety of small objects, chiefly articles of food or clothing, such as were usually sent as presents among friends during the Saturnalia and on other festive occasions. In addition to the above, nearly all the printed copies include thirty-three epigrams, forming a book apart from the rest, which has been commonly known as <title>Liber de Spectaculis</title>, because the contents relate to the shows exhibited by Titus and Domitian; but there is no ancient authority for the title. The different books were collected and published by the author, sometimes singly and sometimes several at one time. The <title>Liber de Spectaculis</title> and the first nine books of the regular series involve a great number of historical allusions, extending from the games of Titus (80) down to the return of Domitian <cb /> from the Sarmatian expedition, in January, 94. All these books were composed at Rome, except the Third, which was written during a tour in Gallia Togata. The Tenth Book was published twice: the first edition was given hastily to the world; the second, that which we now read (x. 2), celebrates the arrival of Trajan at Rome, after his accession to the throne (99). The Eleventh Book seems to have been published at Rome, early in 100, and at the close of the year he returned to Bilbilis. After keeping silence for three years (xii. prooem.), the Twelfth Book was despatched from Bilbilis to Rome (xii. 3, 18), and must therefore be assigned to 104. Books xiii. and xiv., <title>Xenia</title> and <title>Apophoreta</title>, were written chiefly under Domitian, although the composition may have been spread over the holidays of many years. It is well known that the word epigram (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίγραμμα</foreign>), which originally denoted simply “an inscription,” was, in process of time, applied to any brief metrical effusion, whatever the subject might be, or whatever the form under which it was presented. Martial, however, first placed the epigram upon the narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions converge to one sharp point, which forms the termination of the piece. See <ref type="cross" target="crossepigramma">Epigramma</ref>.</p>
 <p>Martial's epigrams are distinguished by singular fertility of imagination, prodigious flow of wit, and delicate felicity of language; and from no source do we derive more copious information on the national customs and social habits of the Romans during the first century of the Empire. But, however much we may admire the genius of the author, we can feel no respect for one whose fulsome servility towards the great is equalled only by the frightful obscenity of much that he has written—an obscenity scarcely conceivable in modern times. He himself seems to feel a certain shame for so pandering to the corrupt tastes of his rich and dissolute patrons, and in one epigram he tries to draw the line between his life and his writings. “My Muse is wanton, but my life is pure” (i. 4, 8); and in the prose dedication to the First Book he explains that he is only following out the traditions of this form of literature; but these are excuses which, to many minds, only heighten the enormity of his offence.</p>
 <p>The principal value of Martial's epigrams is in the insight they give us into the daily life of the times, since they abound in personal details, and are an indispensable contribution towards the <title>Culturgeschichte</title> of Ancient Rome. In modern literature they have been continually imitated and translated, but rarely equalled except now and then by the French.</p>
 <p>The MSS. fall into three “families,” of which the typical representatives are a Paris Codex (T) of the ninth century, a Codex Palatinus (P) of the fifteenth century, and an Edinburgh Codex (E) of the tenth century.

In the Second Punic War he at first fought on the side of the Carthaginians in Spain (B.C. 212), but afterwards deserted their cause and joined the Romans. On his return to Africa he was attacked by the Carthaginians and his neighbour Syphax, and with difficulty maintained his ground till the arrival of Scipio in Africa (B.C. 204). He rendered important service to Scipio, and reduced Cirta, the capital of Syphax. Among the captives that fell into his hands on this occasion was Sophonisba, the wife of Syphax, who had been formerly promised in marriage to Masinissa himself. The story of his hasty marriage with her, and its tragical termination, is related elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssophonisba">Sophonisba</ref>). In the decisive battle of Zama (B.C. 202) Masinissa commanded the cavalry of the right wing. On the conclusion of the peace between Rome and Carthage he was rewarded with the greater part of the territories which had belonged to Syphax, in addition to his hereditary dominions. For the next fifty years Masinissa reigned in peace. He died in the second year of the Third Punic War, B.C. 148, at the advanced age of 90, having retained in an extraordinary degree his bodily strength and activity to the last. He left three sons—Micipsa, Mastanabal, and Gulussa—among whom Scipio Africanus the Younger divided the kingdom.

 <p> called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">Μασσαλία</foreign> (Marseilles). A Greek city in Gallia Narbonensis, on the coast of the Mediterranean, in the country of the Salyes, founded by the Phocaeans of Asia Minor about B.C. 600. It was situated on a promontory, connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus, and washed on three sides by the sea. Its excellent harbour (Lacydon) was formed by a small inlet of the sea, about half a mile long and a quarter of a mile broad. This harbour had only a narrow opening, and before it lay an island, where ships had good anchorage. At an early period the Massilienses cultivated the friendship of the Romans, to whom they always continued faithful allies. Massilia was for many centuries one of the most important commercial cities in the ancient world, and founded a number of other towns, such as Antipolis (Antibes) and Nicaea (Nice). In wealth and power it even excited the jealousy of Carthage, which led to a war between the two cities, in which the Massilienses won a naval victory ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 13</bibl>). Because of its friendship for Rome, the Romans left it independent with its own constitution and government, which was aristocratic or oligarchic, the city being ruled by a Senate of 600 called Timuchi, who acted through smaller councillors ( <title>De Rep.</title> i. 27, 43). In the civil war between Caesar and Pompey (B.C. 49) it espoused the cause of the latter, but after a protracted siege, in which it lost its fleet, it was obliged to submit to Caesar. Its inhabitants had long paid attention to literature and philosophy; and under the early emperors it became one of the chief seats of learning, to which the sons of many Romans resorted in order to complete their studies.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—Athenian tradition ascribed the introduction of the marriage relation to Cecrops (Athen. xiii. 2), before whose time men were said to have had wives in common, as was the case in historic times among the non-Hellenic tribes on the borders of the Greek world—e. g. the Massagetae, Nasamones, and Ausenses ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 126" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 126</bibl>; iv. 172<bibl n="Hdt.  180" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 180</bibl>). In the rest of Greece monogamy was of slow growth as against promiscuity of sexual relation; yet in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> the households described are monogamistic, even though concubines are mentioned. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossconcubina">Concubina</ref>.) Throughout the greater part of Greece the position of the married women was a very subordinate one, the chief exception being found in the usage of Sparta, and to a less degree of Crete and Cyrené and, in general, the Doric States. (See Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> ii. 9; <title>Lac. Apophtheg.</title>) As to illicit relations between the sexes, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmeretrix">Meretrix</ref>.</p>
 <p>We may now consider the subject of Athenian marriage. Marriage at Athens was made compulsory by Solon ( <title>De Amore Prol.</title> 2); but the law fell into disuse. A youthful citizen was not allowed to marry until his name was entered in the tribal register (<foreign lang="greek">ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον</foreign>). The restrictions as to whom he might marry differed from those imposed in modern times, being in part looser, in part more severe. Prohibitions on the ground of consanguinity were less numerous than with us. A man might not marry a direct ancestor or descendant; nor might he marry step-mother or step-daughter, mother-in-law or daughter-inlaw; nor, with an exception to be noticed, his sister. The marriage of Oedipus was looked on with horror, and the fact that it was accidental was not regarded as an alleviation. On the other hand, the marriage of a brother with a half-sister on the father's side did sometimes occur (Demosth. <title>c. Eubul.</title> p. 1304. 20; <title>Themist.</title> 32). Marriage with a niece was common; with an aunt naturally less so, but there was nothing to forbid it.</p>
 <p>The prohibition of marriage between a citizen and an alien belongs to a different class from the prohibition by reason of relationship. It would hardly seem to have existed in the early period of Athenian history ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 130" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 130</bibl>). The influx of foreigners into Athens in the time of Pericles was doubtless the cause that necessitated a more 
<pb n="1013" /><cb />
 stringent law—namely, that both the parents of a citizen must be citizens; whence it resulted that marriage with an alien was forbidden ( <title>Pericl.</title> 37).</p>
 <p>Marriage at Athens took place in two ways: either by <foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύησις</foreign> or by <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδικασία. Ἐγγύησις</foreign> was the ordinary method, and meant the act of the father or guardian (<foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>) of a maiden in giving her in betrothal to her future husband. The act was a solemn one, the relatives of either side being witnesses. Whenever any woman had a <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>, marriage could take place by no other method than this. If, however, a woman were left an heiress (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign>) without having a <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>, then the next of kin might claim her in marriage, preference being given to kindred on the father's side; such a claim was called <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδικασία</foreign>, and was brought in the first instance before the archon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepiclerus">Epiclerus</ref>.) the public interest in such a claim being allowed lay in the danger of dissensions being caused by rival suitors, of which Aristotle (<title>Polit.</title> v. 4) gives instances. If the heiress were poor (<foreign lang="greek">θῆσσα</foreign>), it was likely that no claimant would come forward; in this case the archon was bound to compel the next of kin either himself to marry the heiress or to portion her and give her in marriage (Demosth. <title>c. Macart.</title> p. 1067. 51). It is to be inferred that the next of kin was regarded as <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign> of the heiress in such a case as this. Legitimate children at Athens were invariably the offspring of a marriage ratified according to one of these forms.</p>
 <p>At the time of the betrothal the dowry of the bride was settled, and this was a most important point for her future welfare. For the wife was reckoned to have no claim at all on her husband's property. Supposing her husband died, even the most distant cousin might inherit from him; but the wife, never. Nay, she might not even continue to reside in his house after his death, unless she pleaded pregnancy; in that case she would come under the protection of the archon, and would remain undisturbed until the child was born (Demosth. <title>c. Macart.</title> p. 1076. 75). Hence the dowry was the only security to the wife against extreme poverty in the event of her husband's death, or if she were divorced; the husband, therefore, had to give a guarantee for its return in the shape of some piece of landed property. It would, however, be incorrect to suppose that the dowry would ever become the wife's absolute property; it would in the case supposed revert to her <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>, who would either support her from it or give her in marriage again. But as against her husband or his creditors, it was absolutely hers. The dowry, as has been said, did not exist in Homer's time, and was a gradual growth; Plato disapproved of it (<title>De Leg.</title> vi. 777 A) as tending to produce avarice; in early times it was small.</p>
 <p>The marriage ceremonial at Athens, among the higher classes, was more elaborate than with us. The consecration of all girls to Artemis, when they were ten years old, at the festival Brauronia, stood in intimate relation with it. When the marriage itself drew near, the sacrifice to the tutelar gods of marriage (<foreign lang="greek">θεοὶ γαμήλιοι</foreign>) took place. This was performed by the father, and might take place some days before the marriage, or on the day itself. As to who the tutelary deities were, custom appears to have varied. Diodorus Siculus (v. 73) names Zeus and Heré; but Pollux names Heré, <cb /> Artemis, and the Fates (iii. 38): Artemis is also mentioned in relation to Boeotia and Locris in Plutarch (<title>Aristid.</title> 20); and the Nymphs are mentioned in Plutarch (<title>Amat. Narr.</title> 1). The sacrifice itself was called <foreign lang="greek">προτέλεια γάμων</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">προγάμεια</foreign>, and it was regarded as a dedication of the bride to the deities named, some locks of the bride's hair (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπαρχαί</foreign>) being offered as a symbol of the dedication. On the wedding day itself bride and bridegroom bathed in water drawn from a particular fountain of running water: at Athens this was the fountain Callirrhoë, also called <foreign lang="greek">ἑννεάκρουνος</foreign> ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 15</bibl>). The water from this fountain was carried either by a boy or a girl, from which custom was probably derived that other custom of placing over the tombs of those who died unmarried the image of a girl carrying water. Late in the evening of the wedding day the bridegroom brought his bride from her parents' house on a car (<foreign lang="greek">ἅμαξα</foreign>) drawn by horses, mules, or oxen; on either side of her sat the bridegroom and his “best man” (<foreign lang="greek">παράνυμφος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πάροχος</foreign>,  <bibl n="Dionys. Av. 1735" default="NO"> <title>Av.</title>1735</bibl>). In front of the car went the torch-bearing procession (<foreign lang="greek">δᾷδες νυμφικαί</foreign>), the nuptial torch having been lit by the mother of the bride or of the bridegroom; bride and bridegroom were crowned with chaplets, and clothed in festal attire, as also were the attendants, the bride being covered with a long veil; congratulations were poured out by relations, friends, and well-wishers, and the cry <foreign lang="greek">Ὑμὴν Ὑμέναἰ ὦ</foreign> resounded to the sweet melody of flutes ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 1316" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 1316</bibl>- 1356). On their reaching the bridegroom's house, a peculiar custom prevailed in Boeotia: the axle of the car was burned, to symbolize the irreversible step taken. The bridegroom who had been married before could not bring his bride home in this exultant way; a friend (<foreign lang="greek">νυμφαγωγός</foreign>) in that case brought the bride to him from her house. At the entrance to the bridegroom's house sweetmeats (<foreign lang="greek">καταχύσματα</foreign>) were thrown upon the wedded pair; the doors of the house were covered with garlands, as were those of the bride's house.</p>
 <p>Then followed the wedding-feast (<foreign lang="greek">θοίνη γαμική</foreign>), usually in the house of the bridegroom—one of the most important parts of the entire ceremonial; for the guests were in fact witnesses to the marriage, and their testimony was the final and single proof that it had taken place, since documentary evidence was not looked for or provided (Demosth. <title>c. Onet.</title> p. 869. 20; Athen. v. p. 185 a). At the wedding-feast women were allowed to be present, though at different tables from the men (Lucian, <title>Conviv.</title> 8). Sesame-cakes, symbolical of a fertile marriage, formed a part of the feast. At the conclusion of the feast the bride was conducted, veiled, into the bridal-chamber; the bridegroom closed the door; and a law of Solon enjoined that the bride and bridegroom should eat a quince together, to symbolize the sweetness of their conversation ( <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>20</bibl>). The <ref type="cross" target="crossepithalamium">epithalamium</ref> (q.v.) was then sung before the door of the bridal-chamber by a chorus of maidens, and the song was accompanied with dancing. But the Scholiast on this passage tells us that some epithalamia were sung in the early morning to wake the wedded pair, the two kinds being called <foreign lang="greek">κατακοιμητικά</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">διηγερτικά</foreign> respectively.</p>
 <p>On the second or third day after the marriage the bride for the first time showed herself without a veil, and the gifts which she on that day received from her relatives were thence called <foreign lang="greek">ἀνακαλυπτήρια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὀπτήρια</foreign>. 
<pb n="1014" /><cb /> Among them was a garment (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπαυλιστηρία</foreign>) presented by the bride to the bridegroom, who, on the succeeding night, did not sleep with his bride, but in his father-in-law's house, the bride being unveiled, and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνακαλυπτήρια</foreign> presented the day after.</p>
 <p>An offering to Aphrodité was made by the wedded pair, either on the wedding-day or on the day after. Another ceremony observed after marriage was the sacrifice which the husband offered up on the occasion of his bride being registered among his own phrateres.</p>
 <p>Marriages generally took place in the winter (Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> vii. 16); and the month Gamelion (our January) derived its name from the favour in which it was held for this purpose. The fourth day of the month, according to Hesiod ( <bibl n="Cic. Op. 800" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Op.</title>800</bibl>), was the most favourable day; and as in a lunar month this would be the day on which the first crescent of the new moon appeared, the interpretation of Proclus seems correct: that the day when sun and moon met in the same quarter of the heavens was the day when man and woman might best meet in wedlock. Pindar, however (<title>Isthm.</title> vii. 44), and Euripides (<title>Iph. in Aul.</title> 717) prefer the full moon.</p>
 <p>After marriage the wife lived with the other female inmates of the house in the <foreign lang="greek">γυναικωνῖτις</foreign>, or women's apartments: in a large house these would be a separate building, connected by a passage with the men's rooms. The wife then had the superintendence of the entire household: she had charge of the education of the boys till they were put under a master, of the girls till they were married; she tended the sick, whether free or slave; the kitchen, the furniture, the stores came under her; and last, not least, the <foreign lang="greek">ταλάσια ἔργα</foreign> ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 7. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>vii. 6</bibl>), all that related to the spinning and weaving of wool and the making of clothes, for it must be remembered that the clothes of an ancient household were mostly made within the house itself. If the establishment were a large one, the wife would have a house-keeper (<foreign lang="greek">ταμία</foreign>) to assist her. If the husband were alone, the wife would dine with him, and familiar jesting would pass between them (Lysias, l. c.), or perhaps even serious conversation on politics (Demosth. <title>c. Neaera</title>, p. 1382. 142); but if the husband had other male friends with him, it was thought indecorous for the wife to appear.</p>
 <p>It will be seen that the wife had no lack of duties, but they were duties that would naturally be felt to be monotonous; and it is interesting to find that religious exercises were then, as in later times, one of the chief resources of the married woman.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—Marriage was among the Romans a complete union for life between a man and one woman, which had for its main object the procreation of children (<seg lang="la">liberûm quaesundûm gratia</seg>). To marry and beget children, who could keep up the <seg lang="la">sacra familiaria</seg>, was the religious duty of a Roman, and also a duty to the State.</p>
 <p>The only marriage recognized in early Roman law was that which was conformable to the Ius Civile, and which was called <seg lang="la">iustae nuptiae</seg>, in later times also <seg lang="la">iustum matrimonium</seg> (Ulpian, v. 1, 2). To this marriage of <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg> the <seg lang="la">matrimonium iuris gentium</seg>, or marriage according to gentile law, came to be opposed (<bibl n="Gaius  1. 87" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, i. 87</bibl>). The word <seg lang="la">matrimonium</seg> seems to have been used originally to signify a marriage which was not a civil marriage, <cb /> the child of such marriage following the condition of his mother instead of that of his father, as would have been the case if he had been born from <seg lang="la">iustae nuptiae.</seg></p>
 <p>A Roman civil marriage was either <seg lang="la">cum conventione uxoris in manum viri</seg>, or it was <seg lang="la">sine in manum conventione</seg> (Ulpian, xxvi. 7). The marriage <seg lang="la">cum conventione in manum</seg> differed from that <seg lang="la">sine conventione</seg>, in the effect which it had on the condition of the wife.</p>
 <p>By the marriage <seg lang="la">cum conventione</seg>, the wife came into the power (<seg lang="la">manus</seg>) of her husband, or, if he were a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi>, of his <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias;</hi> leaving her own <seg lang="la">familia</seg>, she passed into the <seg lang="la">familia</seg> of her husband, and was to him in the relation of a <hi rend="italic">filiafamilias</hi> ( <bibl n="Cic. Top. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Top.</title>3</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Top. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Top., 14</bibl>; <bibl n="Gaius  2. 159" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, ii. 159</bibl>). In marriage <seg lang="la">sine conventione</seg> the wife did not pass into the power of her husband; she was, as it were, a stranger (<seg lang="la">extranea</seg>) in his household, her relation to her own family remaining as before the marriage; she did not share in the <seg lang="la">familiaria sacra</seg> of her husband, and bore no civil relation to her own children. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmanus">Manus</ref>.</p>
 <p>A marriage <seg lang="la">cum conventione</seg> was a necessary condition to make a woman a materfamilias in the strict sense of the word. In the marriage <seg lang="la">sine conventione</seg> the wife was merely <seg lang="la">uxor;</seg> that is, a wife and nothing more ( Cic. l. c.).</p>
 <p>The right of entering into a valid civil marriage is called the <seg lang="la">ius conubii.</seg> The <seg lang="la">ius conubii</seg> belonged only to Roman citizens; the cases in which it at any time existed between parties not both Roman citizens, were exceptions to the general rule. “Roman men citizens,” says Ulpian (<title>Fragm.</title> 5, 4, 11), “have <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> with Roman women citizens (<title>Romanae cives</title>), but with Latinae and Peregrinae only in those cases where it has been permitted. With slaves there is no <seg lang="la">conubium.</seg>”</p>
 <p>Originally there was no <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> between the patricians and plebeians, but this was granted by the Lex Canuleia. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex</ref>, p. 941.</p>
 <p>The Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea placed certain restrictions on marriage as to the parties between whom it could take place. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex</ref>, p. 942.) Thus certain marriages were prohibited on account of disparagement, as marriages between senators and freedwomen. The law allowed freeborn persons (<seg lang="la">ingenui</seg>) to marry freedwomen (<seg lang="la">libertinae</seg>). Persons within certain prohibited degrees of relationship could not intermarry. A union of persons within the prohibited degrees was an incestuous one. Relations who had the <seg lang="la">ius osculi</seg>, or right to kiss one another, could not marry one another. See Klenze, <title>Das Familienrecht der Cognaten und Affinen nach röm. und verwandten Rechten</title>, p. 16; and Muirhead, <title>Roman Law</title>, iii. p. 26.</p>
 <p>In early times there could be no marriage between cognates within the seventh degree, but subsequently the prohibited circle was made less wide. There could be no marriage between ascendants and descendants, whether the relation was natural or by adoption; and a man could not marry an adopted daughter or granddaughter, even after he had emancipated her. Brothers and sisters, whether of the whole or half blood, could not marry, but a man might marry a sister by adoption after her emancipation, or after his own emancipation. It became legal to marry a brother's daughter after Claudius had set the example by marrying Agrippina; but the rule was not carried 
<pb n="1015" /><cb /> further than the example, and in the time of Gaius it remained unlawful for a man to marry his sister's daughter (<bibl n="Gaius  1. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, i. 62</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 12. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xii. 5</bibl>; Sueton. <title>Claud.</title> 26). Constantine prohibited a marriage between a man and his brother's daughter. Marriages between first cousins were in later times recognized.</p>
 <p>Betrothal (<foreign lang="la">sponsalia</foreign>) was a necessary preliminary to marriage.</p>
 <p>A marriage <seg lang="la">cum conventione</seg> might be effected by <seg lang="la">confarreatio, coemptio</seg>, or <title>usus. Confarreatio</title> was a form of marriage peculiar to the patricians, while <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg> seems to have been originally confined to the plebeians; but when <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> was extended to the plebeians, <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg> became a common form of intermarriage between the two orders. <title>Confarreatio</title> or <seg lang="la">farreum</seg> was a religious form of marriage, which principally consisted in an offering, with solemn words, of spelt bread (<seg lang="la">panis farreus</seg>) to Iupiter Farreus, in the presence of ten witnesses, the Pontifex Maximus and Flamen Dialis taking part in the ceremony. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscoemptio">Coemptio</ref>; Usus.</p>
 <p>It remains to describe the actual ceremonies of Roman marriage: and it must be premised (1) that there was some difference according to the precise form of marriage adopted, though this distinction gradually disappeared and</p>
 <p>(2) that, as was said above, the greater part of marriage formality was voluntary, and that then, as in our own day, there might be weddings of a far simpler character. When therefore the complete ceremony of the most elaborate kind is described, it must be understood that a great deal of it was often omitted, and the marriage rites narrowed to little beyond the procession. In the choice of the wedding-day, superstition played a large part. May (as by many even now) and the first half of June were unlucky for marriages (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, v. 487; vi. 225). The reason was that the month of May took its general character from the festivals of the <ref type="cross" target="crosslemuria">Lemuria</ref> (q.v.). In the first part of June came <seg lang="la">dies religiosi</seg> connected with the worship of Vesta. Besides these periods, it was necessary to avoid the <seg lang="la">dies parentales</seg>, Feb. 13-21; the first half of March; the three days of the opening of the lower world (<seg lang="la">mundus patet</seg>), viz.: Aug. 24, Oct. 5, <bibl n="Nov.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Nov.8</bibl>; and also the days of Kalends, Ides, and Nones.</p>
 <p>At the <seg lang="la">sponsalia</seg>, besides the formal words of the parent or guardian, <hi rend="italic">Spondesne? Spondeo</hi> (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Aul. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aul.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Aul. 78" default="NO" valid="yes"> Aul., 78</bibl>), the bridegroom gave the bride a present, as an earnest or pledge (<hi rend="italic">arra, pignus</hi>), which was often a ring placed on the fourth finger of the left hand (our “ring finger”), which Gellius (x. 10) says is connected by a nerve with the heart.</p>
 <p>On the day before the marriage the bride put aside her <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, which, with other belongings of childhood, was laid before the Lares, and put on the <seg lang="la">tunica recta</seg>, or <seg lang="la">regilla</seg>, which was woven in one piece in the old-fashioned way at the upright loom. The bride wore this dress also at the marriage, and a flame-coloured veil (<seg lang="la">flammeum</seg>), with which she was said <seg lang="la">nubere caput.</seg> The dress was fastened by a woollen girdle (<seg lang="la">cingulum</seg>) in the <title>nodus Herculeus</title>, as to the significance of which there is some difference of opinion. It has been explained by some as intended to secure a fruitful marriage, because Hercules had many children; Göll takes it to be an amulet against the evil eye (<seg lang="la">fascinum</seg>). But it is perhaps nearer the truth to take it to be the symbol of a stable marriage, and perhaps the original of the “true lovers' knot.” <cb /> The hair was arranged in six locks (<seg lang="la">sex crines</seg>) parted by the point of a spear (<seg lang="la">hasta caelibaris</seg>), and held in place by <seg lang="la">vittae</seg> or bands. Hence the words <seg lang="la">crines</seg> and <seg lang="la">vitta</seg> are used by poets as a synonym for marriage. The custom of parting it with a spear is perhaps a relic of the old marriage by capture, and may convey the idea of the word <foreign lang="greek">δορίληπτος</foreign>. The bride had also a wreath of flowers and sacred herbs (<seg lang="la">verbenae</seg>) gathered by herself, and the bridegroom wore a similar wreath ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>55</bibl>). As an account of the dressing of the bride, the passage in Claudian, <title>VI. Cons. Hon.</title> 523- 528, is well worth reading.</p>
 <p>In the house of the bride, which was decked with garlands ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 227" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 227</bibl>;  <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>i. 2</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 230" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 230</bibl>), were assembled the relations, friends, and clients, as an <seg lang="la">officium</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  2. 132" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.ii. 132</bibl>). Then the omens were taken and announced by the <seg lang="la">auspices</seg> ( <title>Pro Cluent.</title> 4, 14; <bibl n="Juv.  10. 336" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.x. 336</bibl>), with the sacrifice of a sheep (cf.  <bibl n="Verg. A. 4. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>iv. 56</bibl>). It had always been the custom to begin the sacred ceremony of <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> by consulting the omens, and the practice probably was as a rule extended to all marriages ( <title>De Div.</title> i. 16, 28; Plaut. <title>Cas. Prol.</title> 85;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 10.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>x. 21</bibl>). Valerius Maximus (ii. 1, 1) says that in his time the <seg lang="la">auspices</seg> formed in name part of the attendance, though no <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg> for marriage were any longer taken. After these preliminaries, the omens being favourable, the marriage ceremonies began. They were in four main parts: (1) the contract;</p>
 <p>(2) the giving away of the bride, with whatever sacred rites were used;</p>
 <p>(3) the conducting (<seg lang="la">deductio</seg>) to her husband's house (the only <hi rend="italic">invariable</hi> part);</p>
 <p>(4) her reception there. First the marriage tablets (<seg lang="la">tabulae nuptiales</seg> or <seg lang="la">dotales</seg>) were signed before witnesses (<seg lang="la">signatores</seg>), though the marriage was valid without this formality. When the form of marriage called <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg> was adopted (when either or both were plebeians), the formalities of an imaginary sale were gone through before not less than five witnesses, and a <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi> (who held the scales at a sale): questions and answers as to the willingness on both sides followed, and with that ended this distinctive part of the marriage <seg lang="la">per coemptionem;</seg> the other ceremonies followed which were usual in all marriages. After the <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg>, or, where that was not used, after the signing of the <seg lang="la">tabulae nuptiales</seg>, a married woman, who must have been married only once, acting as <seg lang="la">pronuba</seg>, led the bride up to the bridegroom and joined their right hands. It seems probable that there was always some formal expression of willingness to marry, in the old patrician rite of <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> the set form of response from the bride was <title>Quando tu Gaius, ego Gaia</title>, which form of words was used also in the <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg> ( <title>Pro Muren.</title> 12, 27). When the rite of <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> was followed the bloodless offering was made; a cake of spelt (<seg lang="la">farreum libum</seg>) was offered by the Pontifex Maximus and the Flamen Dialis to Iupiter: ten witnesses were present. With the offering to Iupiter a prayer was recited by the Flamen to Iuno as the goddess of marriage, and the deities of the country and its frnits—Tellus, Picumnus, and Pilumnus. During this ceremony the bride and bridegroom sat together upon two seats, which were placed side by side and covered with the skin of the sheep sacrificed before for the auspices: they sat to the left of the altar in the atrium and looked towards it: meanwhile a <seg lang="la">camillus</seg>, i. e. an attendant boy who was <seg lang="la">patrimus et matrimus</seg>, held (perhaps) all 
<pb n="1016" /><cb />
 that was required by the priest for the offering in a covered basket called <hi rend="italic">cumerus.</hi> Sir John Lubbock suggests that the wedding-cake cut by the bride is a survival of the <seg lang="la">farreum</seg> in this rite; but the original for that will be found, if anywhere in the Roman marriage, in the <seg lang="la">mustaceum.</seg> The rite of <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> suggests rather the sacramental view of marriage.</p>
 <p>In what follows, marriages in general of all forms are described. The prayer where there was no <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> (and therefore no Flamen Dialis) was pronounced by the <seg lang="la">auspex</seg>, and was addressed to five deities—Iupiter, Iuno, Venus, Suadela, and Diana. It would seem that sometimes, at least, a victim was here offered. There was next a formal congratulation from the wedding guests in the word <seg lang="la">feliciter</seg> (which, if there was no sacred rite, came directly after the contract). Then came the <seg lang="la">cena nuptialis</seg>, which was certainly, as a rule, given by the bride's father, and therefore before the procession (<bibl n="Catul. 62.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 62, 3</bibl>; Dio Cass. xlviii. 44; Capitol. <title>Ant. Pius</title>, 10). But, as in modern weddings, the place of the wedding-feast might be altered from considerations of space or economy, and it seems sometimes to have been in the bridegroom's house. The wedding-cake (<seg lang="la">mustaceum</seg>), which was made of meal steeped in <hi rend="italic">must</hi> and placed on bay-leaves (<bibl n="Plin.  15.  127" default="NO">Pliny, xv. 127</bibl>), was cut up and distributed to the guests. Afterwards came the procession (<seg lang="la">deductio</seg>), the invariable part of the marriage. This took place usually at dusk, whence arose the custom of having torches (<bibl n="Catul. 62.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 62, 1</bibl>). The bride was taken with simulated force from her mother's arms—clearly a survival of the marriage by capture, or, as the Romans themselves put it, a reminiscence of the Sabine marriage. Flute-players and torch-bearers went in front. The bride was conducted by three boys, <seg lang="la">patrimi et matrimi</seg>, two leading her by the hand, the third carrying a torch of whitethorn for luck. In the procession, besides the general crowd, there came also the <seg lang="la">camillus</seg> with his <hi rend="italic">cumerus</hi>, and the bride's spindle and distaff were carried after her. Fescennine songs were sung during the procession (<bibl n="Catul. 61.126" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 61, 126</bibl>), with interjections of <title>Talasse.</title> As to this deity of the wedding-day, reference may be made to Marquardt, <title>Privatl.</title> p. 54; Preller, <title>Röm. Myth.</title> p. 584 foll. He appears as Talasius, Talasio, Talassus, Thalassius, Thalassio. Livy (i. 9) gives us as bearing that name a companion of Romulus prominent in the rape of the Sabines, and derives the cry <title>Talasse</title> from him: but Talus ( Fest. p. 359) is an old Sabine name, and Talassius may have been a Sabine deity of marriage: Varro connects him with <foreign lang="greek">τάλαρος</foreign>, a work-basket. On the whole a Sabine origin is most probable. The part of the bridegroom in the procession was to scatter nuts for the boys in the crowd ( <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 8. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>viii. 30</bibl>; <bibl n="Catul. 61.131" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 61, 131</bibl>). Though Catullus says that it shows the putting away of childhood, it is much more likely that the nuts symbolized fruitfulness of marriage and plenty. The custom, which may be compared with the Greek <foreign lang="greek">καταχύσματα</foreign>, has its representative in the throwing of rice at the present day. When the bridal train reached the bridegroom's house, the bride bound the door-posts with wool, probably as dedicating her work to it, and anointed them with oil or fat to signify health and plenty. All these actions were, so to speak, personified in a Dea Iterduca, Domiduca, and Unxia. The bride was lifted over the threshold (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 4. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cas.</title>iv. 4</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Cas. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cas., 1</bibl>; <bibl n="Catul. 61.166" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 61, 166</bibl>), <cb /> which, according to some, symbolizes the marriage by capture: others suppose the object to be the prevention of the bad omen, which would be caused by her stumbling on it. Sir John Lubbock (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> p. 97) adopts the former view, and finds a similar custom among such widely divided races as the American Indians, the Chinese, and the Abyssinians. At the entrance the wife repeated the formula <title>ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia;</title> and the husband met her bearing fire and water, to signify that he admitted her to a share in the family hearth and the family lustral rites: the bride, on her part, brought three coins; one she gave as symbol of the dowry to her husband, another to the Lares of the house, a third was dropped in the neighbouring street as an offering for the Lares Compitales. The torch of whitethorn seems to have been scrambled for by the guests as a lucky possession, and the ceremonies were over. The <seg lang="la">lectus genialis</seg> had been prepared by the <seg lang="la">pronuba</seg> in the atrium. On the following day the second wedding-feast, called <seg lang="la">repotia</seg>, was given to the friends and relations in the new home ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Enn.

<div2 id="crossmauretania" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Mauretania">Mauretania</head>

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Mauritania</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Μαυρουσία</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">μαῦρος</foreign>, “black”) (Pausan. i. 33. 5; viii. 43. 3). The most westerly of the principal divisions of northern Africa, lying between the Atlantic on the west, the Mediterranean on the north, Numidia on the east, and Gaetulia on the south; but the districts embraced under the names of Mauretania and Numidia respectively were of very different extent at different periods. The earliest known inhabitants of all northern Africa west of the Syrtes were the Gaetulians, who were displaced and driven inland by peoples of Asiatic origin, who are found, in the earliest historical accounts, settled along the northern coast under various names; their chief tribes being the Mauri or Maurusii, west of the river Malva or Malucha (Muluia); thence the Massaesylii to (or nearly to) the river Ampsaga (Wady-el-Kebir), and the Massylii between the Ampsaga and the Tusca (Wady-Zain), the western boundary of the Carthaginian territory. Of these people, the Mauri, who possessed a greater breadth of fertile country between the Atlas and the coasts, seem to have applied themselves more to the settled pursuits of agriculture than their kindred neighbours on the east, whose unsettled warlike habits were moreover confirmed by their greater exposure to the intrusions of the Phoenician settlers. Hence arose a difference, which the Greeks marked by applying the general name of <foreign lang="greek">Νομάδες</foreign> to the tribes between the Malva and the Tusca; whence came the Roman names of Numidia for the district, and Numidae for its people. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumidia">Numidia</ref>.) Thus Mauretania was at first only the country west of the Malva, and corresponded to the later district of Mauretania Tingitana, and to the modern empire of Morocco, except that the latter extends further south; the ancient boundary on the south was the Atlas.</p>
 <p>The Romans first became acquainted with the country during the war with Iugurtha in B.C. 106. From 106 to 33 the kingdom of Mauretania was increased by the addition of the western part of Numidia, as far as Saldae, which Iulius Caesar bestowed on Bogud, as a reward for his services in the African war. A new arrangement was <cb /> made about 25, when Augustus gave Mauretania to Iuba II., in exchange for his paternal kingdom of Numidia. Upon the murder of Iuba's son, Ptolemaeus, by Caligula (A.D. 40), Mauretania became finally a Roman province, and was formally constituted as such by Claudius, who added to it nearly half of what was still left of Numidia—namely, as far as the Ampsaga, and divided it into two parts, of which the western was called Tingitana, from its capital Tingis (Tangier), and the eastern Caesariensis, from its capital Iulia Caesarea (Zershell), the boundary between them being the river Malva, the old limit of the kingdom of Bocchus I. The latter corresponded to the western and central part of the modern French department of Algiers. These “Mauretaniae duae” were governed by an equestrian procurator. In the later division of the Empire under Diocletian and Constantine, the eastern part of Mauretania Caesariensis, from Saldae to the Ampsaga, was erected into a new province, and called Mauretania Sitifensis from the inland town of Sitifi (Setif); at the same time the western province, Mauretania Tingitana, seems to have been placed under the same government as Spain, so that we still find mention of the two Mauretanias, meaning now, however, Caesariensis and Sitifensis. From A.D. 429 to 534 Mauretania was in the hands of the Vandals, and in 650 and the following years it was conquered by the Arabs. Its ancient inhabitants still exist as powerful tribes in Morocco and Algeria, under the names of Berbers, Kabyles, and Tuariks. Under the later Roman emperors Mauretania was remarkable for the great number of its episcopal sees.

In the twelfth century after Christ the work was still in a good state of preservation; in succeeding centuries it fell to pieces more and more, until the Knights of St. John used it as a quarry from the time when they built their castle on the site of the old Greek acropolis in 1402, down to the repair of their fortifications in 1522, when they made lime of its marble sculptures.

<head orig="Maximīnus">Maximinus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Iulius Verus</hi>. A Roman emperor who reigned from A.D. 235 to 238. He was born in a village on the confines of Thrace, of barbarian parentage, his father being a Goth, <cb /> and his mother a German from the tribe of the Alani. Brought up as a shepherd, he attracted the attention of Septimius Severus by his gigantic stature and marvellous feats of strength, and was permitted to enter the army. He eventually rose to the highest rank in the service; and on the murder of Alexander Severus by the mutinous troops in Gaul (235) he was proclaimed emperor. He immediately bestowed the title of Caesar on his son Maximus. During the three years of his reign he carried on war against the Germans with success, but his government was characterized by a degree of oppression and sanguinary excess hitherto unexampled. The Roman world became at length tired of this monster. The Senate and the provinces gladly acknowledged the two Gordiani, who had been proclaimed emperors in Africa, and after their death the Senate itself proclaimed Maximus and Balbinus emperors (238). As soon as Maximinus heard of the elevation of the Gordians, he hastened from his winter-quarters at Sirmium. Having crossed the Alps he laid siege to Aquileia, and was there slain by his own soldiers along with his son Maximus in April. The most extraordinary tales are related of the physical powers of Maximinus, which seem to have been almost incredible. His height exceeded eight feet. The circumference of his thumb was equal to that of a woman's wrist, so that the bracelet of his wife served him for a ring. It is said that he was able single-handed to drag a loaded wagon, could with his fist knock out the teeth, and with a kick break the leg of a horse; while his appetite was such that in one day he could eat forty pounds of meat and drink an amphora of wine.</p>
 <p>(2) A Roman emperor (305-314), originally called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Daza</hi>, and subsequently <hi rend="SmallCaps">Galerius Valerius Maximīnus</hi>. He was the nephew of Galerius by a sister, and in early life followed the occupation of a shepherd in his native Illyria. Having entered the army, he rose to the highest rank in the service; and upon the abdication of Diocletian in 305, he was adopted by Galerius and received the title of Caesar. In 308 Galerius gave him the title of Augustus, and on the death of the latter, in 311, Maximinus and Licinius divided the East between them. In 313 Maximinus attacked the dominions of Licinius, who had gone to Milan for the purpose of receiving in marriage the sister of Constantine. He was, however, defeated by Licinius near Heraclea, and fled to Tarsus, where he soon after died. Maximinus possessed no military talents. He owed his elevation to his family connection. He surpassed all his contemporaries in the profligacy of his private life, in the general cruelty of his administration, and in the furious hatred with which he persecuted the Christians. An account of the two Maximini is given by Iulius Capitolinus in the <title>Augusta Historia.</title>

 <p>A Roman emperor, A.D. 383-388, in Gaul, Britain, and Spain, was a native of Spain. He was proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain in 383, and forthwith crossed over to Gaul to oppose Gratian, who was defeated by Maximus, and was shortly afterwards put to death. Theodosius found it expedient to recognize Maximus as emperor of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, in order to secure Valentinian 
<pb n="1020" /><cb />
 in the possession of Italy. Maximus, however, aspired to the undivided empire of the West, and accordingly, in 387, he invaded Italy at the head of a formidable army. Valentinian was unable to resist him, and fled to Theodosius in the East. Theodosius forthwith prepared to avenge his colleague. In 388 he forced his way through the Noric Alps, which had been guarded by the troops of Maximus, and shortly afterwards took the city of Aquileia by storm and there put Maximus to death. Victor, the son of Maximus, was defeated and slain in Gaul by Arbogastes, the general of Theodosius.

A Roman emperor, A.D. 455, belonged to a noble Roman family, and enjoyed some of the highest offices of State under Honorius and Valentinian III. In consequence of the violence offered to his wife by Valentinian, Maximus formed a conspiracy against this emperor, who was assassinated, and Maximus proclaimed emperor in his stead. His reign, however, lasted only two or three months. Having forced Eudoxia, the widow of Valentinian, to marry him, she resolved to avenge the death of her former husband, and accordingly Genseric was invited to invade Italy. When Genseric landed at the mouth of the Tiber, Maximus prepared to fly from Rome, but was slain by a band of Burgundian mercenaries, commanded by some old officers of Valentinian.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μήδεια</foreign>). The daughter of Aeëtes, king of Colchis, by the Oceanid Idyia, or, according to others, by Hecaté, the daughter of Perses. She was celebrated for her skill in magic.

</figure> king of Corinth, she took fearful vengeance upon her faithless husband by murdering the two children whom she had borne to him and by destroying his young wife by a poisoned garment; and that she then fled to Athens in a chariot drawn by winged dragons. So far her story has been related elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossiason">Iason</ref>.) At Athens she is said to have married King Aegeus, or to have been beloved by Sisyphus. Zeus himself is said to have sued for her, but in vain, because Medea dreaded the anger of Heré; and the latter rewarded her by promising immortality to her children. Her children are, according to some accounts, Mermerus, Pheres, or Thessalus, Alcimenes, and Tisander; according to others, she had seven sons and seven daughters, while others mention only two children, Medus (some call him Polyxenus) and Eriopis, or one son Argus. Respecting her flight from Corinth, there are different traditions. Some say, as stated above, that she fled to Athens and married Aegeus; but 
<pb n="1021" /><cb />
 when it was discovered that she had laid snares for Theseus, she escaped and went to Asia, the inhabitants of which were called after her Medes (<foreign lang="greek">Μῆδοι</foreign>). Others relate that she first fled from Corinth to Heracles at Thebes, who had promised her his assistance while yet in Colchis, in case of Iason being unfaithful to her. She cured Heracles, who was seized with madness; and as he could not afford her the assistance he had promised, she went to Athens. She is said to have given birth to her son Medus after her arrival in Asia, where she had married a king; whereas others state that her son Medus accompanied her from Athens to Colchis, where her son slew Perses, and restored her father Aeëtes to his kingdom. The restoration of Aeëtes, however, is attributed by some to Iason, who accompanied Medea to Colchis. At length Medea is said to have become immortal, to have been honoured with divine worship, and to have married Achilles in Elysium. The story of Medea is the subject of plays by <ref type="cross" target="crosseuripides">Euripides</ref> (q.v.) and <ref type="cross" target="crossseneca">Seneca</ref> (q.v.).

<div2 id="crossmedia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Media">Media</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μηδία</foreign>). An important country of Asia above Persia, and bounded on the north by the Araxes, on the west and southwest by the range of mountains called Zagros and Parachoatras (Mountains of Kurdistan and Louristan), which divided it from the Tigris and Euphrates valley, on the east by the Desert, and on the northeast by the Caspii Montes (Elburz Mountains). It was a fertile country, well peopled, and one of the most important provinces of the ancient Persian Empire. After the Macedonian conquest it was divided into two parts—Great Media and Atropatené. See <ref type="cross" target="crossatropatene">Atropatené</ref>.</p>
 <p>The earliest history of Media is involved in much obscurity. Herodotus reckons only four kings of Media, namely: (1) Deioces, B.C. 710-657;</p>
 <p>(2) Phraortes, 657-635;</p>
 <p>(3) Cyaxares, 635-595;</p>
 <p>(4) Astyages, 595-560. The last king was dethroned by a revolution, which transferred the supremacy to the Persians, who had formerly been the subordinate people in the united Medo-Persian Empire. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyrus">Cyrus</ref>.) The Medes made more than one attempt to regain their supremacy; the usurpation of the Magian pseudo-Smerdis was no doubt such an attempt (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssmerdis">Smerdis</ref>); and another occurred in the reign of Darius II., when the Medes revolted, but were soon subdued (B.C. 408). With the rest of the Persian Empire, Media fell under the power of Alexander; it next formed a part of the kingdom of the Seleucidae, from whom it was conquered by the Parthians in the second century B.C., from which time it belonged to the Parthian, and then to the later Persian Empire. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspersia">Persia</ref>, with bibliography there given.</p>
 <p>It is important to notice the use of the names Medus and Medi by the Roman poets for the nations of Asia east of the Tigris in general and for the Parthians in particular.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἰατρική</foreign>). The ancients ascribed the origin of the medical art to the gods (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 29. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxix. 2</bibl>), and Prometheus, Chiron, and Asclepius were among those who made it known to men. It was also believed to have been improved by the observation of the remedies instinctively sought out by animals when suffering from injuries or disease (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8. 97" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>viii. 97</bibl>). Thus, dogs taught the Egyptians the use of purgatives, bleeding was learned from the hippopotamus, and enemata from the ibis. Sheep and cattle led men to the use of the natural saline and chalybeate waters. The results of these and various other observations of cures were recorded on tablets, and suspended by the priests in the temples of the gods both in Egypt and in Greece. These tablets were the beginnings of medical literature.</p>
 <p>The Asclepiadae, to which family Hippocrates belonged, were, in a way, hereditary physicians (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaesculapius">Aesculapius</ref>), and founded a number of medical schools, of which the most famous in early times were those of Rhodes, Cnidos, and Cos (Galen, <title>De Meth. Med.</title> i. 1). From the second came the collection of medical observations called <foreign lang="greek">Κνίδιαι Γνῶμαι</foreign>, “Cnidian Maxims,” which long enjoyed a considerable repute. The school of Cos was, however, the best known of the three, and one of its representatives was Hippocrates himself. Herodotus mentions other schools at Crotona in Italy and Cyrené in Africa (iii. 131). Of the different medical sects that sprang up at different times, the following deserve especial mention: (1) The <ref type="cross" target="crossdogmatici">Dogmatĭci</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Hippocratĭci</hi>, founded about B.C. 400 by Thessalus, the son, and Polybus, the son-in-law of Hippocrates;</p>

<div2 id="crossmedicus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Medĭcus">Medicus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἰατρός</foreign>). A physician or surgeon, the name being indiscriminately used of either. In Greece and Asia Minor, physicians were held in higher repute than at Rome, probably because of the traditional association of medicine with religion. 
<pb n="1022" /><cb /> A law of the Locrians quoted by Aelian (<title>Var. Hist.</title> ii. 37), punished with death the patient who disobeyed the orders of his physician. Hippocrates was treated as a demigod by the Athenians, if the account of Soranus be true.</p>
 <p>The Greek physician compounded his own medicines, and either sat in his consulting-room (<foreign lang="greek">ἰατρεῖον</foreign>) or visited his patients, in the latter duty being often accompanied by his pupils or assistants. There is only one mention of a Greek hospital prior to the Roman period. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvaletudinarium">Valetudinaria</ref>.) State physicians were employed in Greece, receiving a salary and their expenses, but no fees ( <title>Aves</title>, 587; <title>Acharn.</title> 994). Thus Democedes received from the public treasury of Aegina about $1400 per annum, and from Athens afterwards a salary of some $2000 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 131" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 131</bibl>). A physician who cured King Antiochus received from him a fee of over $100,000 (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 123" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 123</bibl>; xxix. 5). State physicians attended gratis any one who called for them.</p>
 <p>In the early days of the Republic, Rome had no regular physicians. The haruspices and augurs pretended to some knowledge of medicine; but when a man fell ill, he was usually treated by the <figure id="fig.01022">
<head orig="Aesculapius and a Sick Man. (Millin.)">Aesculapius and a Sick Man. (Millin.)</head>
</figure> old women with their simples; or if the disease was a very serious one, he trusted to religious rites, vows, and sacrifices for his recovery. The various deities of disease were propitiated by temples and altars. In Varro's time there were in Rome three temples to the goddess of Fever; in the Esquiline quarter, an altar to Mefitis, the goddess Malaria; in the centre of the Forum Romanum, an altar to Cloacina, “the goddess of typhoid” (so Lanciani), and near the Praetorian Camp, an altar to Verminus, the god of diseasegerms. Cf. Lanciani, <title>Ancient Rome</title>, pp. 49-73.</p>
 <p>At a later period, among the Greeks who first came in numbers to Rome in the second century B.C., were many professed physicians; and from that time the practice of medicine became a lucrative profession among the Romans, though the chief practitioners remained Greeks, a fact to which the Latin vocabulary bears witness in that its medical terms are nearly all of Greek origin. The elder Pliny gives some interesting details regarding the fees received by the leading doctors. The native physicians of celebrity, Cassius, Calpetanus, and Arruntius, received, he estimates, an income of not less than 250,000 sesterces ($10,000) a year. Quintus Stertinius, a fashionable physician, was asked by the emperor to give up his private practice and devote himself to the imperial family alone. Stertinius said that, as an especial favour, he would do it if he could receive a salary of 500,000 sesterces ($20,000). This struck the emperor as an exorbitant demand, but Stertinius showed <cb /> from his books that his private practice was worth to him at least 600,000 sesterces per annum. The brother of this Stertinius had a sort of partnership with him, and when they died, which they did at about the same time, they left a property of 30,000,000 sesterces ($1,200,000), though they had lived very expensively, and given large sums to public objects. The Greek physicians at Rome probably earned still larger sums. An ex-praetor paid 200,000 sesterces ($8000) as a single fee to the practitioner who treated him for leprosy. Pliny mentions one Thessalus, of whom he says: “No popular actor, no famous jockey, had a greater throng attending him when he appeared in public.”</p>
 <p>Nothing is known of the course of study necessary to qualify a man for medical practice. That there were medical students and clinical lectures is seen from Martial (v. 9). It is probable that the profession was open to all kinds of quacks and impostors, for we read of men taking up medicine as they would any form of trade, with no mention of any special qualification. It is, in fact, likely that, in the main, ancient medicine was little better than quackery, and that the best physicians were men like Crinas who made a careful study of dietetics, and like Asclepiades, who said “Nature is the true physician.” How absurd much of the treatment must have been is shown in the list of remedies given by Pliny in his <title>Historia Naturalis</title> (bk. xxix.). The patent medicines of to-day sink into insignificance beside them. Thus, we read of a mysterious preparation called <title>Theriaca</title> with 600 ingredients, and of another known as “the Mithridatic antidote” with 450. Pliny mentions 35 nostrums prepared from wool<bibl n="Plin.  22" default="NO">Pliny, 22</bibl> from eggs, and also several pastes of which the principal constituent was pounded bugs. The notion, which is still largely prevalent among the laity, that the efficacy of a drug is in direct proportion to its nastiness seems to have had a strong hold on the minds of the ancients. Dog's blood was given for narcotic poisons; urine for gout; goat's gall for ophthalmia; bull's gall and garlic for ear-ache. Superstition entered largely into the treatment. A person afflicted with hiccoughing was gravely advised to touch his lips to a mule's nostrils and be cured. Hydrophobia was treated by applying to the bite the ashes of the dead dog's hair. A still more effectual remedy for the same disease was to cut out the liver of the dog and to eat it raw, applying at the same time to the wound, horse-dung sprinkled with vinegar.</p>
 <p>All these prescriptions are the serious advice of men of reputation. It is not surprising if, on the whole, the profession was less esteemed than others. Pliny the Elder sums up the matter in the following sentences:</p>
 <p>“There is no doubt that physicians in pursuit of celebrity, by the introduction of some novelty or other, purchase it at the cost of human life. Hence these woful discussions, these consultations at the bedside of the patient; hence, too, the ominous inscription to be read upon a tomb—‘I perished by the multitude of physicians’ . . . And there is, moreover, no law to punish the mistakes of a physician, and no instance before us of any punishment so inflicted. They acquire skill at our risk, and put us to death for the sake of making an experiment; for a physician is the only person who is licensed to kill.”</p>
 <p>Other scandals besides those due to ignorance 
<pb n="1023" /><cb />
 were not unknown. So many unprincipled persons entered the profession that it is not surprising to find complaints made of their conduct. Even the palace of the Caesars was the scene of strange occurrences, for it is recorded that both Livia, the wife of Drusus, and the empress Messalina were criminally intimate with their medical attendants. It is not remarkable, therefore, to find a Roman writer concluding a discussion of the subject with the words: “Medicine is the only one of the arts of Greece that, lucrative though it be, Roman dignity still refuses to cultivate.”</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, medicine flourished, and its followers kept increasing in number. We hear of the practice of specialties. General practitioners were known as <seg lang="la">medici;</seg> surgeons as <seg lang="la">chirurgi</seg> and <seg lang="la">vulnerarii.</seg> There were also oculists (<seg lang="la">ocularii</seg>) and dentists (<seg lang="la">medici a dentibus</seg>). We even read of female physicians (Orell. <title>Inscript.</title> 4320-31), and, of course, of numerous midwives (<seg lang="la">obstetrices</seg>). Pharmacies existed, their sign being the Aesculapian snake; and though physicians usually furnished their own drugs, they also gave signed prescriptions (Duruy). The physicians attached to the imperial household were under the direction of a chief styled <hi rend="italic">archiater</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχίατρος</foreign>), or in pure Latin <seg lang="la">dominus medicorum.</seg> The name <hi rend="italic">archiater</hi> was also applied to the dispensary-physicians who gave their services to the people (<seg lang="la">archiatri populares</seg>). See Goldhorn, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Archiatris Romanis</title> (Leipzig, 1841)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Surgery was the branch of medicine most scientifically pursued, and successful operations were performed by the ancient surgeons for stone and cataract, while trephining was not unknown. See <ref type="cross" target="crosschirurgia">Chirurgia</ref>.</p>

 <p>The games were scenic and probably <hi rend="italic">circenses</hi> (Mommsen, <title>C. I. L.</title> i. 391), and were held on the Palatine and later in the theatres.

<head orig="Megăra">Megara</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Μέγαρα</foreign>). (1) The town of Megara, the capital of Megaris, a small district in Greece between the Corinthian and Saronic Gulfs, bounded on the north by Boeotia, on the east and northeast by Attica, on the south by the territory of Corinth, and situated a mile from the sea, opposite the island of Salamis. Its citadel was called Alcathoë, from its reputed founder, Alcathoüs, son of Pelops. Its seaport was Nisaea, which was connected with Megara by two walls, built by the Athenians when they had possession of Megara, B.C. 461-445. In front of Nisaea lay the small island Minoa, which added greatly to the security of the harbour. In ancient times Megara formed one of the four divisions of Attica. It was next conquered by the Dorians, and was for a time subject to Corinth; but it finally asserted its independence, and rapidly became a wealthy and powerful city. Its power at an early period is attested by the flourishing colonies which it founded, of which Selymbria, Chalcedon, and Byzantium, and the Hyblaean Megara in Sicily, were the most important. After the Persian wars, Megara was for some time at war with Corinth, and was thus led to form an alliance with Athens, and to receive an Athenian garrison into the city, B.C. 461; but the oligarchical party <cb /> having got the upper hand, the Athenians were expelled, B.C. 441. Megara is celebrated in the history of philosophy as the seat of a philosophical school, usually called the Megarian, which was founded by Euclid, a native of the city. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseuclides">Euclides</ref> (2).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μελάμπους</foreign>). (1) The son of Amythaon (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaeolus">Aeolus</ref>) and of Idomené; brother of Bias , the oldest Greek seer, and ancester of the family of seers called Melampodidae. The brothers went with their uncle Neleus from Thessaly to Pylus in Messenia, where they dwelt in the country. Melampus owed his gift of soothsaying to some serpents, which he had saved from death and reared, and who in return cleansed his ears with their tongues when he slept; on awaking he understood the voices of birds, and thus learned what was secret. When Neleus would only give Bias his beautiful daughter Pero on condition that he first brought him the oxen of Iphiclus of Phylacé in Thessaly, which were guarded by a watchful dog, Melampus offered to bring the oxen for his brother, though he knew beforehand that he would be imprisoned for a year. He was caught in the act of stealing them, and kept in strict confinement. From the talk of the worms in the woodwork of the roof he gathered that the house would soon fall to pieces. He thereupon demanded to be taken to another prison; and this was scarcely done when the house broke down. When, on account of this, Phylacus, father of Iphiclus, perceived his prophetic gifts, he promised him the oxen, if, by his art, he would find out some way of curing his son's childlessness. Melampus offered a bull to Zeus, cut it in pieces, and invited the birds to the meal. From these he heard that a certain vulture, that had not come, knew how it could be effected. This vulture was made to appear, and related that the defect in Iphiclus was the result of a sudden fright at seeing a bloody knife, with which his father had been castrating some goats; he had dug the knife into a tree, which had grown round about it; if he took some of the rust scraped off it, for ten days, he would be cured. Melampus found the knife, cured Iphiclus, obtained the oxen, and Bias received Pero for his wife.</p>
 <p>Afterwards he went to Argos, because, according to Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 15. 225" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xv. 225</bibl>-240), Neleus had committed a serious offence against him in his absence, <cb /> for which he had taken revenge; while, according to the usual account, he had been asked by king Proetus to heal his daughter, stricken with madness for acting impiously towards Dionysus or Heré. He had stipulated that his reward should be a third of the kingdom for himself, another for Bias ; besides which Iphianassa became his wife, and Lysippé that of Bias , both being daughters of Proetus. A descendant of his son Antiphates was Oïcles, who was a companion of Heracles in the expedition against Troy, and was slain in battle by Laomedon; he again was ancestor of the seer and hero Amphiaraüs. Descendants of his other son Mantius were Cleitus, whom Eos, the goddess of dawn, carried off on account of his beauty, and Polypheides, whom, after the death of Amphiaraüs, Apollo made the best of seers. The son of Polypheides was the seer Theoclymenus, who, flying from Argos on account of committing a murder, met Telemachus at Pylus, was led by him to Ithaca, and announced to Penelopé the presence in Ithaca of Odysseus and to the suitors their approaching death. The seer <ref type="cross" target="crosspolyidus">Polyidus</ref> (q.v.) was also said to be a great-grandson of Melampus. At Argos Melampus was held to be the first priest of Dionysus, and originator of mysterious customs at festivals and at ceremonies of expiation.</p>

<div2 id="crossmeleager" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Meleāger">Meleager</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μελέαγρος</foreign>). (1) The son of Oeneus of Calydon and Althaea, husband of Cleopatra (see <ref type="cross" target="crossidas">Idas</ref>), one of the most celebrated heroes of Greek legend. He took part in the expedition of the Argonauts, and brought about the celebrated chase of the Calydonian boar (see <ref type="cross" target="crossoeneus">Oeneus</ref>), to which he invited the most renowned heroes of the time, Admetus, Amphiaraüs, Iason, Idas, Lynceus, Castor and Pollux, Nestor , Theseus, and Pirithous, Peleus, Telamon, and others. Many lost their lives, till at last Meleager slew the monster. However, Artemis thereupon stirred up a furious strife between the Calydonians and the Curetes who dwelt at Pleuron, about the head and skin of the <figure id="fig.01026">
<head orig="Meleager. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)">Meleager. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> boar, the prize of victory. The Calydonians were victorious as long as Meleager fought at their head; but when he slew the brother of his mother, she invoked a terrible curse on him, and he retired sullenly from the fray. The Curetes immediately forced the Calydonians to retreat, and were already beginning to climb the walls of Calydon, when, at the height of their distress, he yielded to the prayers of his wife, and again joined in the fight to ward off destruction from the city; but he did not return alive, for the Erinys had accomplished the curse of his mother. According to a later legend, the Moerae appeared to his mother on the seventh day after his birth, and announced to her that her son would have to die when a log of wood on the hearth was consumed by the flame; whereupon Althaea immediately snatched the log from the fire and concealed it in a chest. At the Calydonian Hunt, Meleager fell in love with <ref type="cross" target="crossatalanta">Atalanté</ref> (q. v.), <cb /> and gave her (who had inflicted the first wound) the prize, the skin of the animal which he had killed. He slew the brothers of his mother, the sons of Thestius, when they were lying in wait for the virgin to rob her of the boar's hide. Overcome by pain at the death of her brothers, Althaea set fire to the log, and Meleager died a sudden death. His mother and wife hanged themselves; his sisters wept so bitterly for Meleager, that Artemis for pity changed them into guineahens (<foreign lang="greek">μελεαγρίδες</foreign>). Legends relate that even in the nether world Meleager retained his dauntless courage; for when Heracles descended to Hades, all the shades fled before him except Meleager and Medusa.</p>

It was first colonized by the Phoenicians, who called it Byblos or Byblis, and afterwards by the Lacedaemonians, or at least by Dorians. Hence, in the Peloponnesian War, it embraced the side of Sparta. In B.C. 416 it was taken by the Athenians, who killed all the adult males, sold the women and children as slaves, and peopled the island with an Athenian colony. The length of the island is about fourteen miles from east to west, and its breadth from north to south eight miles. In 1820, among the ruins of the ancient city of Melos near the theatre was found the exquisite statue usually called the Venus of Milo (Venere di Milo), now in the Louvre at Paris, having been purchased by the Marquis de Rivière, and by him presented to Louis XVIII.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μένανδρος</foreign>). (1) The chief representative of the New Comedy. He was born in B.C. 342, at Athens, of a distinguished and wealthy family, received a careful education, and led a comfortable and luxurious life, partly at Athens, and partly at his estate in the Piraeus, the harbour of Athens, enjoying the intimate friendship of his contemporary and the friend of his youth, Epicurus, of Theophrastus, and of Demetrius Phalereus. He declined an invitation from King Ptolemy I. of Egypt, so as not to have his comfort disturbed. At the height of his poetic productiveness he was drowned while bathing in the Piraeus, at the age of fifty-two. His uncle Alexis had given him some preparatory training in dramatic composition. As early as 322 he made his first appearance as an author. He wrote above a hundred pieces, and worked with the greatest facility; but he only obtained the first prize for eight comedies, in the competition with his popular rival Philemon. The admiration accorded him by posterity was all the greater: there was only one opinion about the excellence of his work. His principal merits were remarkable inventiveness, skilful arrangement of plots, life-like painting of

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μηνᾶς</foreign>). A familiar form of Menodōrus (<foreign lang="greek">Μηνόδωρος</foreign>). A freedman of Pompey the Great and one of the principal commanders of the fleet of Sextus Pompey against Antony and Octavianus (B.C. 40). In B.C. 39 he tried in vain to dissuade his master from concluding a peace with Octavianus and Antony; and, at an entertainment given to them by Sextus on board his ship at Misenum, Menas suggested to him to cut the cables of the vessel, and, running it out to sea, despatch both his rivals. The treacherous proposal, however, was rejected by Pompey. On the breaking out of the war again in B.C. 38, Menas deserted Pompey <cb /> and went over to Octavianus. In B.C. 36 he returned to his old master's service; but in the course of the same year he again played the deserter, and joined Octavianus. In B.C. 35 he accompanied Octavianus in the Pannonian campaign, and was slain at the siege of Siscia. According to the old scholiasts, this Menas is the person so vehemently attacked by Horace in the Fourth Epode.

<head orig="Menedēmus">Menedemus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μενέδημος</foreign>). A Greek philosopher, a native of Eretria. Though of noble birth, he was poor, and worked for a livelihood either as a builder or as a tent-maker. According to one story, he seized the opportunity afforded by his being sent on some military service to Megara to hear Plato, and abandoned the army to addict himself to philosophy; but it may be questioned whether he was old enough to have heard Plato before the death of the latter. According to another story, he and his friend Asclepiades got their livelihood as millers, working during the night that they might have leisure for philosophy in the day (Athen. p. 168). The two friends afterwards became disciples of Stilpo at Megara. From Megara they went to Elis, and placed themselves under the instruction of some disciples of Phaedo. On his return to Eretria Menedemus established a school of philosophy, which was called the Eretrian. He did not, however, confine himself to philosophical pursuits, but took an active part in the political affairs of his native city, and came to be the leading man in the State. He went on various embassies to Lysimachus, Demetrius, and others; but being suspected of the treacherous intention of betraying Eretria into the power of Antigonus, he quitted his native city secretly, and took refuge with Antigonus in Asia. Here he starved himself to death in the seventy-fourth year of his age, probably about B.C. 277. Of the philosophy of Menedemus little is known, except that it closely resembled that of the Megarian School, on which see <ref type="cross" target="crosseuclides">Euclides</ref>, p. 630.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μενέλαος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Μενέλεως</foreign>). A son of Atreus, and younger brother of Agamemnon, with whom he was exiled by Thyestes, the murderer of Atreus, and fled to King Tyndareos, at Sparta, whose daughter Helen he married, and whose throne he inherited after the death of Helen's brothers, Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux). When Paris had robbed him of his wife and of great treasures, he went with Odysseus to Troy to demand restitution, and they were hospitably received there by Antenor. His just claims were refused, and his life was even put in danger. He and Agamemnon accordingly called on the Greek chieftains to join in an expedition against Troy, and himself furnished sixty ships. At Troy he distinguished himself in counsel and in action, and was specially protected by Athené and Heré. In the single combat with Paris he was victorious, but his opponent was rescued and carried off by Aphrodité. On demanding that Helen and the treasures should be restored, he was wounded by an arrow shot by the Trojan Pandarus. He was also ready to fight Hector, and was only prevented by the entreaties of his friends. When Patroclus had fallen, he shielded the dead body, at first alone, and then with the aid of Aiax, and bore it from the field of battle with Meriones. He was also one of the heroes <cb /> of the wooden horse. Having recovered Helen he hastened home, but on rounding the promontory of Malea was driven to Egypt with five ships, and wandered about for eight years among the peoples of the East, where he was kindly received everywhere, and received rich presents. He was finally detained at the isle of Pharos by contrary winds, and with the help of the marine goddess Eidothea artfully compelled her father Proteus to prophesy to him. He thus learned the reason for his being detained at the island, and was also told that, as husband of the daughter of Zeus, he would not die, but enter the Elysian plains alive. After appeasing the gods in Egypt with hecatombs, he returned prosperously to his home, where he arrived on the very day on which Orestes was burying Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra. He spent the rest of his life quietly with Helen, in Lacedaemon. Their only daughter Hermioné was married to Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.

<pb n="1032" /><cb />
 employed in later times. Thus, the foot, the finger, the palm of the hand, the forearm were all employed as primitive units of length and breadth. Units of capacity were generally based upon such natural objects or measures as were approximately uniform. The Jews and some of the Kelts employed the hen's egg as a unit; the natives of Zanzibar the gourd; the Romans a mussel-shell (<hi rend="italic">cochlear</hi>). Possibly the Greek <foreign lang="greek">κύαθος</foreign> was originally a pod or gourd of some kind. The filled hand also is mentioned as serving as a measure of capacity.

The first was 295.7 millimetres; the second, 320.5 mill.; the third, 330 mill. In Western Europe there were three kinds of foot (<seg lang="la">pes</seg>), the Italian (275 mill.), the Roman (296 mill.), and the <title>pes Drusianus</title> (333 mill.). In both the Greek and the Roman systems the unit (<foreign lang="greek">μονάς</foreign>) was the finger-breadth (<foreign lang="greek">δάκτυλος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">digitus</seg>). The <seg lang="la">palmus</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">δοχμή</foreign>) was four <seg lang="la">digiti.</seg> The foot was regarded as equal to 16 <seg lang="la">digiti.</seg> The cubit (<foreign lang="greek">πῆχυς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">cubitus</seg>) was the distance from the point of the elbow to the point of the middle finger, and=24 <seg lang="la">digiti.</seg></p>
 <p>The fathom (<foreign lang="greek">ὀρεγυιά</foreign>, <seg lang="la">ulna</seg> or <seg lang="la">tensum</seg> in Low Lat.) was the length of the extended arms=six feet. The <foreign lang="greek">πλέθρον</foreign> (Oscan and Umbr. <seg lang="la">vorsus</seg>) was about 100 feet. The Roman <seg lang="la">actus</seg> was 120 feet. Among the itinerary measures the <seg lang="la">stadium</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign>) was 600 feet; the <foreign lang="greek">ἱππικόν</foreign>, or race-course, was four <seg lang="la">stadia;</seg> the parasang (<foreign lang="greek">παρασάγγης</foreign>), a Persian measure, was 30 <seg lang="la">stadia</seg> or four Roman miles; the <hi rend="italic">millarum</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">μίλιον</foreign>) was 1000 feet (<seg lang="la">milia passuum</seg>).</p>
 <p>Of land measures were the Homeric unit <foreign lang="greek">γύης</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">γύη</foreign>), about 60 feet; the square plethrum=10,000 sq. ft.; the <seg lang="la">scripulum</seg>=100 sq. ft.; the <seg lang="la">iugerum</seg>= 288 sq. rods; the <seg lang="la">heredium</seg>=2 <seg lang="la">iugera;</seg> the <seg lang="la">centuria</seg> = 200 <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> (perhaps originally 100); the <seg lang="la">saltus</seg>= 800 <seg lang="la">iugera.</seg></p>
 <p>Of liquid and dry measures, the chief are the <foreign lang="greek">κύαθος</foreign>=.08 of an Eng. pint; the <foreign lang="greek">κοτύλη</foreign>=6 <seg lang="la">cyathi;</seg> the Roman <seg lang="la">sextarius</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ξέστης</foreign>)=12 <seg lang="la">cyathi</seg>, nearly an Eng. pint; the <foreign lang="greek">χοῦς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">congius</seg>=12 <seg lang="la">cyathi</seg>, or about six pints; the <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφορεύς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">amphora</seg>=8 <seg lang="la">congii</seg> or 48 <seg lang="la">sextarii</seg>, about 22 quarts; and the <seg lang="la">culleus</seg>=20 <seg lang="la">amphorae.</seg> Distinctly for dry measure were the <foreign lang="greek">χοῖνιξ</foreign>=four <foreign lang="greek">κοτύλαι</foreign>, or about one quart; the <foreign lang="greek">μόδιος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">modius</seg>=about a peck; the <foreign lang="greek">μέδιμνος</foreign>= 6 <seg lang="la">modii.</seg></p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μέντωρ</foreign>). (1) Son of Alcimus of Ithaca, friend of Odysseus, who, on departing for Troy, confided to him the care of his house and the education of Telemachus (<title>Odyss.</title> ii. 225). His name <cb /> has hence become a proverbial one for a wise and faithful adviser or monitor.

As some of his works were destroyed at the burning of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, in B.C. 356, obviously he lived before that event, and probably flourished in the best period of Greek art, though he is never mentioned by any earlier Greek writer than Lucian (<title>Lexiphanes</title>, 7). He worked mainly in silver. The orator Crassus paid 100,000 sesterces ($4000) for two cups chased by his hand, but, from regard to their value, refrained from using them. Varro possessed a statue wrought by him in bronze; and one Diodorus at Lilybaeum, two fine cups in the style of those adorned with figures of animals by Thericles, the Corinthian potter. Martial (iii. 41) mentions a cup with a lifelike representation of a lizard, and often refers to him (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  8. 104" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.viii. 104</bibl>).</p>

<div2 id="crossmercenarii" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Mercenarii">Mercenarii</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μισθωτοί, μισθοφόροι, ξένοι</foreign>, and collectively <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ξενικόν</foreign>). Mercenary troops. Apart from a few earlier examples of the employment of mercenaries, a regular organization of such troops was formed among the Greeks in the course of the Peloponnesian War, especially by the Arcadians, who were compelled by the poverty of their own country to utilize their strength and courage by seeking employment outside it. It was most easily found by serving as soldiers in the continual wars between the Grecian States. When the mercenary system was at its height, Arcadians formed by far the larger portion of the mercenary forces, even as early as in the first great army of mercenaries of 13,000 men, which the younger Cyrus led against his brother Artaxerxes, king of Persia, in B.C. 401. In Greece in the fourth century the ground became more and more favourable to the growth of the mercenary body, and the citizens of the Greek States, instead of bearing arms themselves, became more and more inclined to leave their wars to be fought out by mercenaries, especially since it had become a trade to form troops of mercenaries, and to let them out wholesale for service, no matter whether to Greeks or barbarians. Even prominent men, such as Agesilaüs and Philopoemen, did not consider it beneath their dignity to fight for strangers at the head of mercenaries. One of the chief recruiting places in the fourth century was Corinth, and afterwards for a time the district near the promontory of Taenarum in Lacedaemon. The generals of mercenaries were called <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign>; their captains, through whom they raised companies of different kinds of troops, known as <foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign>, one hundred men in number, <foreign lang="greek">λοχαγοί</foreign>. The usual monthly pay of a common soldier was on the average a gold daric (=20 silver drachmae or $3 in intrinsic value of silver, but in intrinsic value of the 
<pb n="1033" /><cb />
 gold contained in it a little more than $5). Out of this he had to maintain himself entirely, to buy his armour, and keep it in good condition. The pay of the <foreign lang="greek">λοχαγοί</foreign> was double and of the <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign> four times that amount. In later times the <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign>, when they entered with complete armies into the service of some power at war, seem to have generally received considerable sums at the conclusion of the contract. The Romans also employed foreign mercenaries after the Second Punic War, especially as archers and slingers, and after the time of Marius a recruited army of mercenaries (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslegio">Legio</ref>) had sprung out of the earlier levied army of citizens; but the mercenary organization never took among the Romans a form similar to that among the Greeks.

<head orig="Merētrix">Meretrix</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πόρνη</foreign>). A woman of loose character. There are a number of words in Greek and Latin to designate the harlot; <foreign lang="greek">ἑταίρα</foreign> and <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> usually implying one who has a quasi-recognized connection with a single man, while <foreign lang="greek">πόρνη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">meretrix, scortum</seg>, etc., designate the common prostitute: <foreign lang="greek">παλλάκή, παλλακίς</foreign>, and <hi rend="italic">pellex</hi> usually imply the kept mistress of a married man. See <ref type="cross" target="crossconcubina">Concubina</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—In Greece the State not only tolerated but protected the public courtesans. Solon is said to have established a brothel (<foreign lang="greek">πορνεῖον</foreign>) from whose profits he built a temple to Aphrodité Pandemos. In later times the number of such places increased and were licensed (<foreign lang="greek">πορνικὸν τέλος</foreign>), as in Paris and other Continental cities to-day. Women living by themselves also paid a regular tax like the <hi rend="italic">filles inscrites.</hi> The keepers of houses of ill-fame were known as <foreign lang="greek">πορνοβοσκοί</foreign>. Private courtesans were very numerous at Athens and especially at Corinth, which last city was proverbial for its loose morals and the beauty of its <hi rend="italic">hetaerae.</hi> Some of these persons were famous throughout Greece for their wit and accomplishments, and seem to have prided themselves on their mental gifts. Thus the Arcadian Lasthenea was a pupil of Plato, Leontion of Epicurus, and <ref type="cross" target="crossaspasia">Aspasia</ref> (q.v.) is said to have instructed Sophocles and Pericles. For other famous courtesans, see the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossharmodius">Harmodius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslais">Laïs</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphryne">Phryné</ref>.</p>
 <p>As virtuous women in Greece (outside of Sparta and a few Dorian communities) were kept strictly at home and possessed few accomplishments, we find the <hi rend="italic">hetaera</hi> occupying often the influential position which in modern times belongs to the lawful wife; and so long as the husband did not altogether neglect his wife, any associations that he might have outside his own home with <hi rend="italic">hetaerae</hi> were not regarded with severity. It is probable that the indulgence with which women of this class were looked upon sprang in part from the semi-religious character of the prostitute as being associated with the worship of Aphrodité. At Corinth, for instance, a large number of these women were formally dedicated to the service of that goddess and were styled <foreign lang="greek">ἱερόδουλοι</foreign>. Few citizens ever entered the ranks of the <foreign lang="greek">πορναί</foreign>, and whenever such a case happened loss of citizenship was <cb /> the penalty, as also for a person who kept a <foreign lang="greek">πορνεῖον</foreign>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—In the early days of the Roman Republic prostitution was little known, and when recognized was branded with infamy. It seems to have been first introduced as a regular profession from Etruria, and at last assumed frightful proportions and had little or no legal restriction. Its growth was fostered by the spread of slavery among the Romans, since from the slave-markets both men and women, bred in the midst of Oriental corruption, came from Asia and Africa to taint the old-time purity of Rome by their influence. The pages of Ovid, Petronius, Juvenal, and Martial supply a mass of information regarding the frightful prevalence of the social evil. Under the Empire, so lightly was public debauchery regarded that ladies of noble birth voluntarily abandoned their rank in order to enroll themselves in the police-registers as courtesans; while Juvenal states that the empress Messalina, the wife of Claudius, used to steal away from the imperial palace at night and under the assumed name of Lycisca occupy a harlot's cell ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 638" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 638</bibl>). Dancing-girls, actresses, musicians, and professional women in general were regularly classed as <seg lang="la">meretrices;</seg> and there were both those who occupied public houses (<seg lang="la">lupanaria</seg>) and those who lived in private lodgings. The parts of the city that were most frequented by them were the Suburra (q. v.), the Vicus Tuscus, the Vicus Patricius, the baths, the Summoenium (near the walls), and the arcades of the Circus Maximus, where remains of their low-vaulted cells (<seg lang="la">cellae</seg>) still exist. These places were small and a little lower than the sidewalk, and were also known as <seg lang="la">fornices</seg> from the arch (<seg lang="la">fornix</seg>) that formed their roof. At the entrance to each was usually a sign (<seg lang="la">titulus</seg>) bearing the name of the <seg lang="la">meretrix</seg> and her price. The wording of one of them has been preserved for us in the <title>Apollonius Tyrius</title> (ch. xxx.). Besides the names given above, these women were called <seg lang="la">lupae</seg>, “wolves,” <hi rend="italic">prostibulae (pro+stabulum), prosedae (pro+sedeo), bustuariae</hi> (as plying their trade near the <hi rend="italic">bustae</hi> or cemeteries), <seg lang="la">diobolariae, alicariae</seg> (from the bakeries), and <seg lang="la">nonariae</seg> (as forbidden to appear on the streets before the <seg lang="la">hora nona</seg>, 3 p. m.).</p>
 <p>Some few attempts were made to control and regulate this evil. <title>Meretrices</title> were forbidden to wear the <seg lang="la">stola</seg> of the matron, but dressed in a dark toga; and the city praetor had power to imprison, scourge, or banish them without a trial. Yet the restraint put upon them was only nominal, and as they were publicly recognized in some of the great festivals, such as the <ref type="cross" target="crossfloralia">Floralia</ref> (q.v.), they may be said to have had a sort of official standing.</p>

On the north it was separated from Armenia by a branch of the Taurus, called Masius, and on the south from Babylonia by the Median Wall. The name was first used by the Greeks in the time of the Seleucidae. In earlier times the country was reckoned a part, sometimes of Syria, and sometimes of Assyria. In the division of the Persian empire it belonged to the satrapy of Babylonia. The northern part of Mesopotamia was divided into the districts of Mygdonia and Osroëné.

</figure> was the third wife of the emperor Claudius. She married Claudius, to whom she was previously related, before his accession to the Empire. Her profligacy and licentiousness were notorious; and the absence of virtue was not concealed by a lingering <cb /> sense of shame or even by a specious veil of decorum, inasmuch as she often visited the public brothels ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 115" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 115</bibl>). She was as cruel as she was profligate, and many members of the most illustrious families of Rome were sacrificed to her fears or her hatred. She long exercised an unbounded empire over her weak husband, who alone was ignorant of her infidelities. For some time she was supported in her career of crime by the freedmen of Claudius; but when Narcissus, the most powerful of the emperor's freedmen, perceived that he should probably fall a victim to Messalina's intrigues, he determined to get rid of her. The insane folly of Messalina furnished the means of her own destruction. Having conceived a violent passion for a handsome Roman youth, C. Silius, she publicly married him with all the rites of a legal connubium during the absence of Claudius at Ostia, A.D. 48. Narcissus persuaded the emperor that Silius and Messalina would not have dared such an outrage had they not determined also to deprive him of empire and life. Claudius wavered long, and at length Narcissus himself issued Messalina's death-warrant. She was put to death by a tribune of the guards in the gardens of Lucullus ( <bibl n="Tac.

<div2 id="crossmessana" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Messāna">Messana</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μεσσήνη</foreign>). The modern Messina; a celebrated town of Sicily, on the strait separating Italy from this island, which is here about four miles broad. The Romans called the town Messana, according to its Doric pronunciation, but Messené was its more usual name among the Greeks. It was originally a town of the Siceli, and was called Zanclé, or a sickle, on account of the shape of its harbour, which is formed by a singular curve of sand and shells. It was first colonized by Chalcidians, and was afterwards seized by Samians, who had come to Sicily after the capture of Miletus by the Persians (B.C. 494). The Samians were shortly afterwards driven out of Zanclé by Anaxilas, who changed the name of the town into Messana or Messené, both because he was himself a Messenian and because he transferred to the place a body of Messenians from Rhegium. In B.C. 396 it was taken and destroyed by the Carthaginians, but was rebuilt by Dionysius. It afterwards fell into the hands of Agathocles. Among the mercenaries of this tyrant were a number of Mamertini, an Oscan people from Campania, who had been sent from home, under the protection of the god Mamers, or Mars, to seek their fortune in other lands. These Mamertini were quartered in Messana; and after the death of Agathocles (B.C. 282) they made themselves masters of the town, killed the male inhabitants, and took possession of their wives, their children, and their property. The town was now called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mamertīna</hi>, and the inhabitants Mamertini; but its ancient name of Messana continued to be in more general use. The new inhabitants could not lay aside their old predatory habits, and in consequence became involved in a war with Hieron of Syracuse, who would probably have conquered the town had not the Carthaginians come in to the aid of the Mamertini, and, under the pretext of assisting them, taken possession of their citadel. The Mamertini had at the same time applied to the Romans for help, who gladly availed themselves of the opportunity to obtain a footing in Sicily. Thus Messana was the immediate cause of the First Punic War, 264. The 
<pb n="1036" /><cb /> Mamertini expelled the Carthaginian garrison, and received the Romans, in whose power Messana remained till the latest times.

<div2 id="crossmessenia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Messenia">Messenia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μεσσηνία</foreign>). A country in Peloponnesus, bounded on the east by Laconia, from which it was separated by Mount Taygetus, on the north by Elis and Arcadia, and on the south and west by the sea. In the Homeric times the western part of the country belonged to the Neleid princes of Pylos, of whom Nestor was the most celebrated; and the eastern to the Lacedaemonian monarchy. On the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, Messenia fell to the share of Cresphontes, who became king of the whole country. Messenia was more fertile than Laconia; and the Spartans soon coveted the territory of their brother-Dorians; and thus war broke out between the two people. The First Messenian War lasted twenty years, B.C. 743-723; and notwithstanding the gallant resistance of the Messenian king, Aristodemus, the Messenians were obliged to submit to the Spartans after the capture of their fortress Ithomé. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaristodemus">Aristodemus</ref>.) After bearing the yoke thirtyeight years, the Messenians again took up arms under their heroic leader, <ref type="cross" target="crossaristomenes">Aristomenes</ref> (q.v.). The Second Messenian War lasted seventeen years, B.C. 685-668, and terminated with the conquest of Ira and the complete subjugation of the country. Most of the Messenians emigrated to foreign countries, and those who remained behind were reduced to the condition of Helots or serfs. In this state they remained till 464, when the Messenians and other Helots took advantage of the devastation occasioned by the great earthquake at Sparta to rise against their oppressors. This Third Messenian War lasted ten years (464- 455), and ended by the Messenians surrendering Ithome to the Spartans on condition of being allowed a free departure from Peloponnesus. When the supremacy of Sparta was overthrown by the battle of Leuctra, Epaminondas collected the Messenian exiles, and founded the town of Messené (B.C. 369), at the foot of Mount Ithomé, which formed the acropolis of the city. Messené was <cb /> made the capital of the country. Messenia was never again subdued by the Spartans, and it maintained its independence till the conquest of the Achaeans and the rest of Greece by the Romans (B.C. 146).

 <p> (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Iron (<foreign lang="greek">σίδηρος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">ferrum</seg>). Iron is one of the latest metals to come into use owing to the difficulty of working it (Hesiod, 150); but it had begun to be employed in the Homeric Age ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 34</bibl>) for swords and also for ploughshares, though bronze was much commoner. In Hesiod's <title>Shield of Heracles</title> hot iron is plunged into water to harden it. By the time of Croesus (i. e. the sixth century B.C.) iron had supplanted bronze for weapons ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 67</bibl>; Pausan. iii. 3, 6). Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14. 139" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 139</bibl>) implies that the Romans used iron in the time of Porsena; and in the early Gallic invasions the Roman weapons of iron were a source of superiority over the Gauls, whose weapons were easily bent. Later, in the first century B.C., the Cimbri who invaded Italy had swords, javelins, and even corselets of iron, according to Plutarch. In Greece, Cyprus and the cities of Chalcis and Lacedaemon were celebrated for their iron ware; but external nations like the Chalybes of Pontus surpassed the best work of the Hellenic smiths ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 5. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Anab.</title>v. 5</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. Anab., 1</bibl>). Iron was sometimes used in art, as we learn that Aecon made an iron statue of Heracles. The people of <ref type="cross" target="crosssparta">Sparta</ref> (q.v.) and of Byzantium used iron in their coinage (Pollux, ix. 78). 
<pb n="1037" /><cb /></p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) Lead (<foreign lang="greek">μόλυβδος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">plumbum nigrum</seg>). Being easy to work, lead was much employed in ancient times, especially for coffins, water-pipes, etc. It was recognized also in ancient medicine. See Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 156" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 156</bibl> foll., for a full account.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) Tin (<foreign lang="greek">κασσίτερος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">plumbum album</seg>). Tin was very widely used and is found employed in the Homeric Age in the adornment of arms. Herodotus (iii. 115) speaks of it as produced in the islands of the Western Sea, the Cassiterides, perhaps the Scilly Isles (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscassiterides">Cassiterides</ref>); Diodorus mentions the coast of Britain as its source; while Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 156" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 156</bibl>) says that it came from Spain. It is probable that the Phoenicians were the principal purveyors and importers of it. The name <foreign lang="greek">κασσίτερος</foreign> suggests the Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">kastIra</foreign>, so that it may first of all have been brought from India.</p>
 <p><title>(i) Stannum</title>, an alloy of silver with lead, used for plating bronze (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 159" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 159</bibl>).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) Mercury or quicksilver (<foreign lang="greek">ὑδράργυρος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">argentum vivum</seg>) was produced by the ancients from cinnabar and used in gold-mining (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 97" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 97</bibl>).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) Zinc. Zinc is not specifically mentioned in the ancient writings, but was known to the Romans at any rate, for an analysis of Roman coins shows its presence to a considerable extent (Mommsen, <title>Römisches Münzwesen</title>, p. 763).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">l</hi>) Nickel, a metal also not named, but found in the coins of some of the Greek kings of India in the third century B.C. (<title>Numismatic Chronicle</title> for 1868, p. 305).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Mining</hi>. Information regarding the ancient mines is scanty, the chief authorities dealing only with the lead and silver mines of Attica and the gold and silver mines of Spain. The most satisfactory source is Xenophon's treatise <title>De Vectigalibus</title> (iv. 2), which deals with the Attic mines. The mines had shafts and adits. The ores were smelted with charcoal (<foreign lang="greek">ἄνθρακες</foreign>). Fuller explanations regarding the Roman mines are given by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33." default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii.</bibl>), Diodorus Siculus (v. 36), and Strabo (iii. pp. 146 foll.). Shafts, galleries, pumps, cross-drains, etc., were elaborate and scientific. In Spain gold was obtained in large quantities by washing, as in modern placer mining; while gold found in nuggets was refined by being first treated with an astringent and afterwards by heat.</p>
 <p>In Greece the mines were the property of the State, which leased them for various terms, but only to citizens and <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοτελεῖς</foreign>. The labour was performed by slaves. Under the Roman Republic mines were private property, but under the Empire were worked for the emperor and yielded a considerable revenue to the <seg lang="la">fiscus.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfiscus">Fiscus</ref>.). The workmen were usually slaves, criminals, or soldiers.</p>

 <p> A distinguished plebeian family of the Caecilia gens at Rome. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Caecilius Metellus</hi>, consul B.C. 251, carried on the war in Sicily against the Carthaginians.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus</hi>, son of the preceding, was plebeian aedile B.C. 209; curule aedile 208; served in the army of the consul Claudius Nero 207, and was one of the legates sent to Rome to convey the joyful news of the defeat and death of Hasdrubal; and was consul with L. Veturius <bibl n="Philo  206." default="NO">Philo, 206.</bibl>In his consulship he and his colleague carried on the war against Hannibal in Bruttium, where he remained as proconsul during the following year. In 205 he was dictator for the purpose of holding the comitia. Metellus survived the Second Punic War many years, and was employed in several public commissions.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonĭcus</hi>, son of the last, was praetor in B.C. 148, and carried on war in Macedonia against the usurper Andriscus, whom he defeated and took prisoner. He next turned his arms against the Achaeans, whom he defeated at the beginning of 146. On his return to Rome in 146, he triumphed, and received the surname of Macedonicus. Metellus was consul in 143, and received the province of Nearer Spain, where he carried on the war with success for two years against the Celtiberi. He was succeeded by Q. Pompeius in 141. Metellus was censor 131. He died 115, full of years and honours. He is frequently quoted by the ancient writers as an extraordinary instance of human felicity. He had filled all the highest offices of the State with reputation and glory, and was carried to the funeral pile by four sons, three of whom had obtained the consulship in his lifetime, while the fourth was a candidate for the office at the time of his death.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Caecilius Metellus Calvus</hi>, brother of the last, consul B.C. 142.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Balearĭcus</hi>, eldest son of No. 3 was consul B.C. 123, when he subdued the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands, and received in consequence the surname of Balearicus. He was censor B.C. 120.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Caecilius Metellus Diademātus</hi>, second son of No. 3, has been frequently confounded with Metellus Dalmaticus, consul B.C. 119. Metellus Diadematus received the latter name from his wearing for a long time a bandage round his forehead, in consequence of an ulcer. He was consul B.C. 117.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Caecilius Metellus</hi>, third son of No. 3, was consul B.C. 115, the year in which his father died. In 114 he was sent into Sardinia as proconsul, and suppressed an insurrection in the island, in consequence of which he obtained a triumph in B.C. 113 on the same day as his brother Caprarius.</p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">C. Caecilius Metellus Caprarius</hi>, fourth son of No. 3. The origin of his surname is quite uncertain. He was consul B.C. 113, and carried on war in Macedonia against <cb /> the Thracians, whom he subdued. He obtained a triumph in consequence in the same year and on the same day with his brother Marcus. He was censor B.C. 102 with his cousin Metellus Numidicus.</p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Caecilius Metellus Dalmatĭcus</hi>, elder son of No. 4, and frequently confounded, as has been already remarked, with Diadematus, was consul B.C. 119, when he subdued the Dalmatians, and obtained in consequence the surname Dalmaticus. He was censor with Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus in 115; and he was also pontifex maximus. He was alive in 100, when he is mentioned as one of the senators of high rank who took up arms against Saturninus.</p>
 <p>(10) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Numidĭcus</hi>, younger son of No. 4, was one of the most distinguished members of his family. The character of Metellus stood very high among his contemporaries; in an age of growing corruption, his personal integrity remained unsullied; and he was distinguished for his abilities in war and peace. He was one of the chief leaders of the aristocratic party at Rome. He was consul B.C. 109, and carried on the war against Iugurtha in Numidia with great success. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossiugurtha">Iugurtha</ref>.) He remained in Numidia during the following year as proconsul; but as he was unable to bring the war to a conclusion, his legate C. Marius industriously circulated reports in the camp and the city that Metellus designedly protracted the war for the purpose of continuing in the command. These rumours had the desired effect. Marius was raised to the consulship, Numidia was assigned to him as his province, and Metellus saw the credit of finishing the war snatched from his grasp. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmarius">Marius</ref>.) On his return to Rome in 107 he was received with the greatest honour. He celebrated a splendid triumph, and received the surname of Numidicus. In 102 he was censor with his cousin Metellus Caprarius. In 100 the tribune Saturninus and Marius resolved to ruin Metellus. Saturninus proposed an agrarian law, to which he added the clause that the Senate should swear obedience to it within five days after its enactment, and that whosoever should refuse to do so should be expelled from the Senate and pay a heavy fine. Metellus refused to take the oath, and was therefore expelled from the Senate; but Saturninus, not content with this, brought forward a bill to punish him with exile. The friends of Metellus were ready to take up arms in his defence; but Metellus quitted the city and retired to Rhodes, where he bore his misfortune with great calmness. He was, however, recalled to Rome in the following year (99) on the proposition of the tribune Q. Calidius. The orations of Metellus are spoken of with praise by Cicero, and they continued to be read with admiration in the time of Fronto.</p>
 <p>(11) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos</hi>, son of Balearicus and grandson of Macedonicus, appears to have received the surname of Nepos because he was the eldest grandson of the latter. Metellus Nepos exerted himself in obtaining the recall of his kinsman Metellus Numidicus from banishment in B.C. 99, and was consul in 98 with T. Didius. In this year the two consuls carried the lex Caecilia Didia.</p>
 <p>(12) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius</hi>, son of Numidicus, received the surname of Pius on account of the love which he displayed for his father when he besought the people to recall him from banishment in B.C. 99. He was praetor B.C. 89, and was one of the commanders in the Marsic or Social War. He was still in 
<pb n="1039" /><cb />
 arms in 87, prosecuting the war against the Samnites, when Marius landed in Italy and joined the consul Cinna. The Senate, in alarm, summoned Metellus to Rome; but as he was unable to defend the city against Marius and Cinna , he crossed over to Africa. After remaining in Africa three years, he returned to Italy and joined Sulla , who also returned to Italy in 83. In the war which followed against the Marian party, Metellus was one of the most successful of Sulla 's generals, and gained several important victories both in Umbria and in Cisalpine Gaul. In 80 Metellus was consul with Sulla himself; and in the following year (79) he went as proconsul into Spain, in order to prosecute the war against Sertorius, who adhered to the Marian party. Here he remained for the next eight years, and found it so difficult to obtain any advantages over Sertorius that the Senate sent Pompey to his assistance with proconsular power and another army. Sertorius, however, was a match for them both, and would probably have continued to defy all the efforts of Metellus and Pompey if he had not been murdered by Perperna and his friends in 72. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssertorius">Sertorius</ref>.) Metellus was pontifex maximus, and, as he was succeeded in this dignity by Iulius Caesar in 63, he must have died either in this year or at the end of the preceding.</p>
 <p>(13) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q Caecilius Metellus Celer</hi>, elder son of Nepos. In B.C. 66 he served as legate in the army of Pompey in Asia; and was praetor in 63, the year in which Cicero was consul. During his year of office he afforded warm and efficient support to the aristocratic party. He prevented the condemnation of C. Rabirius by removing the military flag from the Ianiculum. He coöperated with Cicero in opposing the schemes of Catiline; and, when the latter left the city to make war upon the Republic, Metellus had the charge of the Picentine and Senonian districts. By blocking up the passes he prevented Catiline from crossing the Apennines and penetrating into Gaul, and thus compelled him to turn round and face Antoninus, who was marching against him from Etruria. In the following year, 62, Metellus went with the title of proconsul into the province of Cisalpine Gaul, which Cicero had relinquished because he was unwilling to leave the city. In 60 Metellus was consul with L. Afranius, and opposed all the efforts of his colleague to obtain the ratification of Pompey's acts in Asia and an assignment of lands for his soldiers. He died in 59, and it was suspected that he had been poisoned by his wife Clodia, with whom he lived on the most unhappy terms, and who was a woman of the utmost profligacy.</p>
 <p>(14) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos</hi>, younger son of the elder Nepos (No. 11). He served as legate of Pompey in the war against the pirates and in Asia from B.C. 67 to 64. He returned to Rome in 63 in order to become a candidate for the tribunate, that he might thereby favour the views of Pompey. His election was opposed by the aristocracy, but without success. His year of office was a stormy one. One of his first acts in entering upon his office on the 10th of December, 63, was a violent attack upon Cicero. He maintained that the man who had condemned Roman citizens without a hearing ought not to be heard himself, and accordingly prevented Cicero from addressing the people on the last day of his consulship, and only allowed him to take the usual oath, whereupon Cicero swore that he had saved <cb /> the State. In the following year (62) Metellus brought forward a bill to summon Pompey, with his army, to Rome, in order to restore peace; but on the day on which the bill was to be read, the two parties came to open blows; and Metellus was obliged to take to flight. He repaired to Pompey, with whom he returned to Rome in 61. He was praetor in 60, and consul in 57 with P. Lentulus Spinther. Notwithstanding his previous enmity with Cicero, he did not oppose his recall from exile. In 56 Metellus administered the province of Nearer Spain, where he carried on war against the Vaccaei. He died in 55. Metellus did not adhere strictly to the political principles of his family. He did not support the aristocracy, like his brother; nor, on the other hand, can he be said to have been the leader of the democracy. He was rather the faithful henchman of Pompey, opposing or supporting Cicero as his master required.</p>
 <p>(15) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Caecilius Metellus Cretĭcus</hi>, tribune of the people in B.C. 49 and a supporter of the aristocracy. At the outbreak of the Civil War he did not leave the city when Pompey fled, but remained and opposed Caesar, who demanded possession of the sacred treasury. Metellus yielded only on compulsion ( <title>Caes., Pomp.;</title> <title>B. C.</title> i. 33).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>). The name given at Athens to aliens (other than slaves) resident in Attica. When the State was most flourishing, they numbered 10,000 adult men (B.C. 309). The favourable position of Athens for commerce and the rich opportunities for carrying on trade and for selling merchandise induced both Greeks and barbarians to settle there. The Athenians besides had the reputation among the Greeks of being friendly towards foreigners. For the legal protection granted them by the State, they paid a sum of twelve drachmae ($2) annually for each man, and half as much for each independent woman; and they had to choose a patron (<foreign lang="greek">προστάτης</foreign>) to conduct their dealings with the State in all public and private affairs—e. g. the bringing of an action. Whoever failed to do the one or the other was summoned before a law court, and, if guilty, sold as a slave. They were prohibited from marrying citizens and from obtaining landed property; but they could follow any trade they pleased, on payment of a tax (<foreign lang="greek">μετοίκιον</foreign>). They also had to pay the extraordinary taxes for war (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσφοραί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λειτουργίαι</foreign>), and were obliged to serve either in the fleet or in the army; they might be hoplites, but not knights. At festivals (e. g. the Panathenaea) it was their duty to follow the processions, carrying sunshades, pitchers, and bowls or trays filled with honey or cakes. A decree of the people could, in return for special services, confer on them the <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοτέλεια</foreign>, which placed them on a level with the citizens with regard to liturgies, or public burdens, freed them from the necessity of having a patron or paying a tax for protection, and gave them the right of holding property in land and of transacting business with the people or the authorities without an intermediary; but even this privileged class did not possess the active rights of a citizen.</p>
 <p>Resident aliens were found in most other cities and States besides Athens. (See the list given by Schenkl in the <title>Wiener Studien</title> for 1880, ii. pp. 163 foll.) At Sparta, however, they were not allowed to settle ( <title>Resp. Lac.</title> xiv. 4), and so, possibly, Apollonia (<title>V. H.</title> xiii. 16).

He died 277, in the fiftythird year of his age, seven years before Epicurus, who would have appointed him his successor had he survived him. The philosophy of Metrodorus appears to have been of a more grossly sensual kind than that of Epicurus. Perfect happiness he made to consist in having a well-constituted body.

It is also mentioned by Aristotle (<title>De Insomn.</title> 2), but seems not to have been very common in Greece. It was played by two persons, who simultaneously held up their right hands with one, more than one, or none of the fingers extended. At the same time each called out a number which represented his guess at the sum of all the fingers extended by both players. The correct guesser, of course, won; or, as sometimes played, the one whose successful guesses first amounted to five in number was the winner (Nonius, xxxiii. 77).

<div2 id="crossmidas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Midas">Midas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μίδας</foreign>). The son of Gordius and Cybelé. He was the wealthy but effeminate king of Phrygia, a pupil of Orpheus, and a great patron of the worship of Dionysus. His wealth is alluded to in a story connected with his childhood, for it is said that while a child, ants carried grains of wheat into his mouth to indicate that one day he should be the richest of all mortals. Midas was introduced into the satyric drama of the Greeks, and was represented with the ears of a Satyr, which were afterwards lengthened into the ears of an ass. He is said to have built the town of Ancyra, and as king of Phrygia he is called <title>Berecynthius heros</title> (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 11. 106" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xi. 106</bibl>).</p>
 <p>There are several stories connected with Midas, of which the following are the most celebrated: Silenus, the companion and teacher of Dionysus, had gone astray in a state of intoxication, and was caught by country people in the rose-gardens of Midas. He was bound with wreaths of flowers and led before the king. These gardens were in Macedonia, near Mount Bermion or Bromion, where Midas was king of the Bruges, with whom he afterwards emigrated to Asia, where their name was changed into Phryges. Midas received Silenus kindly; and, after treating him with hospitality, he led him back to Dionysus, who allowed Midas to ask a favour of him. Midas in his folly desired that all things which he touched should be changed into gold. The request was granted; but as even the food which he touched became gold, he implored the god to take his favour back. Dionysus accordingly ordered him to bathe in the source of Pactolus near Mount Tmolus. This bath saved Midas, but the river from that time had an abundance of gold in its sand.</p>
 <p>Midas, who was himself related to the race of Satyrs, once had a visit from a Satyr, who indulged in all kinds of jokes at the king's expense. Thereupon Midas mixed wine in a well; and when the Satyr had drunk of it, he fell asleep and was caught. This well of Midas was at different times assigned to different localities. Xenophon ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1. 2. 13" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>i. 2. 13</bibl>) places it in the neighbourhood of Thymbrium and Tyraeum, and Pausanias at Ancyra. Once when Pan and Apollo were engaged in a musical contest on the flute and lyre, Midas was chosen to decide between them. The king decided in favour of Pan, whereupon Apollo changed his <cb /> ears into those of an ass. Midas contrived to conceal them under his Phrygian cap, but the servant who used to cut his hair discovered them. The secret so much harassed this man that, as he dared not betray it to a human being, he dug a hole in the earth, and whispered into it, “King Midas has ass's ears.” He then filled the hole up again, and his mind was relieved. But on the same spot a reed grew up, which in its whispers betrayed the secret. Midas is said to have killed himself by drinking the blood of an ox. (Strabo, p. 61.) <figure id="fig.01042">

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μίλητος</foreign>). (1) One of the greatest cities of Asia Minor.

The city stood upon the southern headland of the Sinus Latmicus, opposite to the mouth of the Maeander, and possessed four distinct harbours, protected by a group of little islands; its territory was rich in flocks, and the city was celebrated for its woollen fabrics, the <title>Milesia vellera.</title> At a very early period it became a great maritime State, and founded numerous colonies, especially on the shores of the Euxine. Among these were Abydos, Tomi, Olbia, Cyzicus, and Odessus; and in Egypt, Naucratis.

Many stories are related of his extraordinary feats of strength: such as his carrying a heifer four years old on his shoulders through the stadium at Olympia, and afterwards eating the whole of it in a single day. Passing through a forest in his old age, he saw the trunk of a tree which had been partially split open by wood-cutters, and attempted to rend it further, but the wood closed upon his hands, and thus held him fast, in which state he was attacked and devoured by wolves ( <bibl n="Gel.  15. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xv. 16</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus Annius Milo Papiniānus</hi>, was born at Lanuvium, of which place he was in B.C. 53 dictator or chief magistrate. As tribune of the plebs, B.C. 57, Milo took an active part in obtaining Cicero's recall from exile; and from this time he carried on a fierce and memorable contest with P. Clodius. In 53 Milo was candidate for the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship of the ensuing year. Each of the candidates kept a gang of gladiators, and there were <cb /> frequent combats between the rival ruffians in the streets of Rome. At length, on the 20th of January, 52, Milo and Clodius met apparently by accident at Bovillae, on the Appian Way. An affray ensued between their followers, in which Clodius was slain. At Rome such tumults followed upon the burial of Clodius that Pompey was appointed sole consul in order to restore order to the State. Milo was brought to trial. He was defended by Cicero; but was condemned, and went into exile at Massilia (Marseilles). The soldiers who lined the Forum intimidated Cicero, and he could not deliver the oration which he had prepared. Milo returned to Italy in 48, in order to support the revolutionary schemes of the praetor, M. Caelius; but he was slain under the walls of an obscure fortress in Thurii. Milo, in 57, married Fausta, a daughter of the dictator Sulla , a worthless woman with whom the historian Sallust carried on an intrigue, for which he was soundly beaten by Milo.

<head orig="Miltiădes">Miltiades</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μιλτιάδης</foreign>). (1) The son of Cypselus. He was a man of considerable distinction in Athens in the time of Pisistratus. The Doloncians, a Thracian tribe dwelling in the Chersonesus, being hard pressed in war by the Absinthians, applied to the Delphic oracle for advice, and were directed to admit a colony led by the man who should be the first to entertain them after they left the temple. This was Miltiades, who, eager to escape from the rule of Pisistratus, gladly took the lead of a colony under the sanction of the oracle, and became tyrant of the Chersonesus, which he fortified by a wall built across its isthmus. In a war with the people of Lampsacus he was taken prisoner, but was set at liberty on the demand of Croesus. He died without leaving any children, and his sovereignty passed into the hands of Stesagoras, the son of his half-brother Cimon. Sacrifices and games were instituted in his honour, in which no Lampsacene was suffered to take part ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 34</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  38" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 38</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  103" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 103</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) The son of Cimon and brother of Stesagoras. He became tyrant of the Chersonesus on the death of the latter, being sent out by Pisistratus from Athens to take possession of the vacant inheritance. By a stratagem he got the chief men of the Chersonesus into his power and threw them into prison, and took a force of mercenaries into his pay. In order to strengthen his position still more, he married Hegesipylé, the daughter of a Thracian prince named Olorus. He joined Darius Hystaspis on his expedition against the Scythians, and was left with the other Greeks in charge of the bridge over the Danube. When the appointed time had expired, and Darius had not returned, Miltiades recommended the Greeks to destroy the bridge and leave Darius to his fate. Some time after the expedition of Darius, an inroad of the Scythians drove Miltiades from his possessions; but after the enemy had retired the Doloncians brought him back. It appears to have been between this period and his withdrawal to Athens, that Miltiades conquered and expelled the Pelasgian inhabitants of Lemnos and Imbros and subjected the islands to the dominion of Attica. Lemnos and Imbros belonged to the Persian dominions; and it is probable that this encroachment on the Persian possessions was the cause which drew upon Miltiades 
<pb n="1044" /><cb />
 the hostility of Darius, and led him to fly from the Chersonesus, when the Phoenician fleet approached, after the subjugation of Ionia. Miltiades reached Athens in safety, but his eldest son Metiochus fell into the hands of the Persians. At Athens Miltiades was arraigned, as being amenable to the pen<figure id="fig.01044">
<head orig="Miltiades.">Miltiades.</head>
</figure> alties enacted against tyranny, but was acquitted. When Attica was threatened with invasion by the Persians under Datis and Artaphernes, Miltiades was chosen one of the ten generals. Miltiades by his arguments induced the polemarch Callimachus to give the casting vote in favour of risking a battle with the enemy, the opinions of the ten generals being equally divided. Miltiades waited till his turn came, and then drew his army up in battle array on the ever-memorable field of Marathon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmarathon">Marathon</ref>.) After the defeat of the Persians, Miltiades endeavoured to urge the Athenians to measures of retaliation, and induced them to intrust to him an armament of seventy ships, without knowing the purpose for which they were designed. He proceeded to attack the island of Paros, for the purpose of gratifying a private enmity. His attacks, however, were unsuccessful; and after receiving a dangerous hurt in the leg, while penetrating into a sacred enclosure on some superstitious errand, he was compelled to raise the siege and return to Athens, where he was impeached by Xanthippus for having deceived the people. His wound had turned into a gangrene, and, being unable to plead his cause in person, he was brought into court on a couch, his brother Tisagoras conducting his defence for him. He was condemned; but on the ground of his services to the State the penalty was commuted to a fine of fifty talents, the cost of the equipment of the armament. Being unable to pay this, he was thrown into prison, where he not long after died of his wound. The fine was subsequently paid by his son Cimon.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—The Roman mimus was a more or less unconventional character-play of every-day life acted without masks or buskins.

The mimus became very popular at Rome, and was finally made a sort of afterpiece (<seg lang="la">exodium</seg>). It was acted in front of the curtain (<seg lang="la">siparium</seg>) by an actor (also called <seg lang="la">mimus</seg>) who wore no buskins, and was hence styled <seg lang="la">planipes.</seg> He also had no mask, but wore a sort of harlequin coat of many colours (<seg lang="la">centunculus</seg>) and a <seg lang="la">phallus.</seg> The chief characters were the <seg lang="la">archimimus</seg>, or hero, and the <seg lang="la">stupidus</seg> or <seg lang="la">parasitus</seg>, the butt of the hero.

<head orig="Minerva">Minerva</head>

 <p> originally <hi rend="bold">Menerva</hi> (Etruscan, Menfra). One of the great Roman divinities, the goddess of wisdom; identified with the Greek <ref type="cross" target="crossathene">Athené</ref> (q.v.). Her name contains the same root as <seg lang="la">mens, me-min-i, mentio</seg>, etc., and she is accordingly the thinking, calculating, and inventive power personified. Iupiter was the first, Iuno the second, and Minerva the third in the number of the Capitoline divinities. Tarquin, the son of Demaratus, was believed to have united the three divinities in one common temple, and hence, when repasts were prepared for the gods, these three always went together. She was the daughter of Iupiter, and is said to have sometimes wielded the thunderbolts of her father. As Minerva was a virgin divinity, and her father the supreme god, the Romans easily identified her with the Greek Athené, and accordingly all the attributes of Athené were gradually transferred to the Roman Minerva; but we confine ourselves at present to those which were peculiar to the Roman goddess. Being a maiden <figure id="fig.01045">
<head orig="Minerva. (Gem in the King Collection.)">Minerva. (Gem in the King Collection.)</head>
</figure> goddess, her sacrifices consisted of calves which had not borne the yoke. She is said to have invented numbers; and it is added that the law respecting the driving in of the annual nail was for this reason attached to her temple. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossclavus">Clavus</ref>.) She was worshipped as the patroness of all the arts and trades, and at her festival she was particularly invoked by all who desired to distinguish themselves in any art or craft, such as painting, poetry, the art of teaching, medicine, dyeing, spinning, weaving, and the like. This character of the goddess may be perceived also from the proverbs “to do a thing <title>pingui Minerva</title>,” i. e. to do a thing in an awkward or clumsy manner; and <title>sus Minervam (docet)</title> of a stupid person who presumed to set right an intelligent one. Minerva, however, was the patroness, not only of women, on whom she conferred skill in sewing, spinning, weaving, etc., but she also guided men in the dangers of war, where victory is gained by cunning, prudence, courage, and perseverance. Hence she was represented with a helmet, shield, and a coat of mail; and the booty made in war was frequently dedicated to her. Minerva was further believed to be the inventor of musical instruments, especially wind instruments, the use of which was very important in religious worship, and which were accordingly subjected to a sort of purification every year on the last day of the festival of Minerva. This festival lasted five days, from the 19th to the 23d of March, and was called <title>Quinquatrus</title>, because it began on the fifth day after the Ides of the month. On this date the Roman boys brought to their teachers the school fee (<title>Minerval</title>). This number <cb /> of days was not accidental, for we are told that the number five was sacred to Minerva. The most ancient temple of Minerva at Rome was probably that on the Capitol; another existed on the Aventine; and she had a chapel at the foot of the Caelian Hill, where she bore the surname of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Capta</hi>— a title borrowed from the Faliscans, but of doubtful import (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, iii. 843).

<head orig="Minos">Minos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μίνως</foreign>). The son of Zeus and Europa, brother of Rhadamanthus, was the king and legislator of Crete. After his death he became one of the judges of the shades in Hades. He was the father of Deucalion and Ariadné; and, according to Apollodorus, the brother of Sarpedon. Some traditions relate that Minos married Itoné, daughter of Lyctius, by whom he had a son, Lycastus, and that the latter became, by Ida, the father of another Minos. But it should be observed that Homer and Hesiod know of only one Minos, the ruler of Cnossus, and the son and friend of Zeus; and that they relate nearly the same things about him which later traditions assign to a second Minos, the grandson of the former. In this case, as in many other mythical traditions, a rationalistic criticism attempted to solve contradictions and difficulties in the stories about a person, by assuming that the contradictory accounts must refer to two different personages.</p>
 <p>Assuming, however, the fact of a second Minos, he was also a king and lawgiver of Crete. He is described as the husband of Pasiphaë, a daughter of Helios; and as the father of Catreus, Deucalion, Glaucus, Androgeos, Acallé, Xenodicé, Ariadné, and Phaedra. After the death of Asterius, Minos aimed at the supremacy of Crete, and declared that it was destined to him by the gods; in proof of which, he asserted that the gods always answered his prayers. Accordingly, as he was offering up a sacrifice to Poseidon, he prayed that a bull might come forth from the sea, and promised to sacrifice the beast. The bull appeared and Minos became king of Crete. Minos, however, admiring the beauty of the bull, did not sacrifice him, but substituted another in his place, whereupon 
<pb n="1046" /><cb /> Poseidon rendered the bull furious, and made Pasiphaë conceive a passion for the animal. Daedalus enabled Pasiphaë to gratify her passion, and she became by the bull the mother of the Minotaurus, a monster with a human body and a bull's head, or, according to others, with a bull's body and a human head. The monster was kept in the labyrinth at Cnossus, constructed by Daedalus. Daedalus fled from Crete to escape the wrath of Minos and took refuge in Sicily. Minos followed him to Sicily, and was there slain by Cocalus and his daughters.</p>
 <p>Minos is further said to have divided Crete into three parts, and to have ruled nine years. The Cretans traced their legal and political institutions to Minos. He is said to have been instructed in the art of legislation by Zeus himself; and the Spartan Lycurgus was believed to have taken the legislation of Minos as his model. In his time Crete was a powerful maritime State; and Minos not only checked the piratical pursuits of his contemporaries, but made himself master of the Greek islands of the Aegean. The most ancient legends describe Minos as a just and wise lawgiver, whereas the later accounts represent him as an unjust and cruel tyrant. In order to avenge the wrong done to his son <ref type="cross" target="crossandrogeos">Androgeos</ref> (q.v.) at Athens, he made war against the Athenians and Megarians. He subdued Megara, and compelled the Athenians either every year or every nine years to send him as a tribute seven youths and seven maidens, who were devoured in the labyrinth by the Minotaurus. The monster was slain by Theseus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossariadne">Ariadné</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheseus">Theseus</ref>.</p>
 <p>It is generally held that the tradition of Minos embodies a certain amount of historical truth, and that there really was a king of that name who ruled Crete before the Dorian migration, and developed a formidable sea-power, which he used in putting down piracy.

The daughters of Minyas, the rich king of Orchomenus and mythical ancestral hero of the race of the Minyae; their names were Alcathoë (Alcithoë), Leucippé, and Arsippé. When the worship of Dionysus was introduced into Boeotia, and all the other women wandered in frenzy over the mountains in honour of the god, they alone remained at home, and profaned the festival by working at their looms, in spite of the warning of the god, who had appeared to them in the shape of a maiden. It was not till he had assumed the shapes of a bull, a lion, and a panther, had made milk and wine flow from the yarnbeams, and had changed their weft into grapes and vine-leaves, that they were terrified and drew lots who should offer a sacrifice to the god; and Leucippé, on whom the lot fell, tore her own son Hippasus to pieces in her Bacchic fury. They then raged about on the mountains till they were transformed into bats. With this legend was connected the custom, that at the annual festival of Dionysus the priest of the god was allowed to pursue the women of the Minyan race with a drawn sword and kill them (Aelian, <title>V.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μίθρας</foreign>). The Persian god of created light and of all earthly wisdom. In the course of time he became identified with the sun-god, who conquers all demons of darkness. In the time after Alexander the Great, his worship, mixed with various customs peculiar to Western Asia, was extended over all the Oriental kingdoms. In the first half of the first century B.C. it is said to have been introduced into the Roman provinces in the West by the Cilician pirates who were at that time masters of the Mediterranean ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>24</bibl>). There are traces of his worship at Rome under Tiberius; and in the beginning of the second century after Christ, under the Antonines, it became common throughout the whole Roman Empire, and was kept up till the end of the fourth century. Mithras was a special favourite of the Roman armies. Being born from the rocks, he was worshipped in <cb /> natural or artificial caves, such as have been found in every part of the Roman Empire. He is represented as a young man in Oriental dress and as an invincible hero, stabbing a bull with his dagger, or standing upon a bull that he has thrown down. The sacrifice of a bull and the purification of his worshippers with bull's blood formed a part of the rites of Mithras. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstaurobolium">Taurobolium</ref>.</p>
 <p>Specimens of a Mithras group may be seen in the Louvre, in the British Museum, and elsewhere. The cave itself was explained by the ancients to signify the world, into which the human soul must descend, that it may be purified by many trials before leaving it. Before any one was initiated into the mysteries of Mithras, it was necessary for the person to undergo a series of (it is said eighty) trials of increasing difficulty; and an undaunted, <figure id="fig.01047">
<head orig="Mithras. (Louvre.)">Mithras. (Louvre.)</head>
</figure> unsubdued spirit had to be maintained in fire and water, hunger and thirst, scourging, and solitude, and the aspirant was thus prepared for the initiation. It consisted of seven degrees, that of the ravens, the secret, the fighters, the lions or shelions (for women were also received), the Persians, the sun-runners, and the fathers (<foreign lang="greek">κόρακες, κρύφιαι, λέοντες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λέαιναι, Ἡλιόδρομοι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">patres</seg> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀετοί</foreign>). Various Christian rites seem also to have been introduced into the mysteries of Mithras.

He was the first of the kings of Pontus who made an alliance with the Romans, whom he assisted in the Third Punic War and in the war against Aristonicus (131-129). He was assassinated at Sinopé by a conspiracy among his own immediate attendants.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mithridates VI.</hi>, king of Pontus (120-63), surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Eupător</hi>, also <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysus">Dionȳsus</ref>, but more commonly “the Great,” was the son and successor of the preceding, and was only eleven years old at the period of his accession. We have very imperfect information concerning the earlier years of his reign, and much of what has been transmitted wears a suspicious aspect. It is said that immediately on ascending the throne he found himself assailed by the designs of his guardians, but that he succeeded in eluding all their machinations, partly by displaying a courage and address in warlike exercises beyond his years, partly by the use of antidotes against poison, to which he began thus early to accustom himself. In order to evade the designs formed against his life, he also devoted much of his time to hunting, and took refuge in the remotest and most unfrequented regions, under pretence of pursuing the pleasures of the chase. Whatever truth there may be in these accounts, it is certain that when he attained to manhood he was not only endowed with consummate skill in all martial exercises, and possessed of a bodily frame inured to all hardships as well as a spirit to brave every danger, but his naturally vigorous intellect had been improved by careful culture. As a boy, he had been brought up at Sinopé, where he had probably received the elements of a Greek education; and so powerful was his memory that he is said to have learned not less than twenty-two languages, and to have been able in the days of his greatest power to transact business with the deputies of every tribe subject to his rule in their own peculiar dialect.</p>
 <p>The first steps of his career were marked by blood. He is said to have murdered his mother, to whom a share in the royal authority had been left by Mithridates Euergetes; and this was followed by the assassination of his brother. In the early part of his reign he subdued the barbarian tribes between the Euxine and the confines of Armenia, including the whole of Colchis and the province called Lesser Armenia, and even extended his conquests beyond the Caucasus. He assisted Parisades, king of the Bosporus, against the <cb /> Sarmatians and Roxolani, and rendered the whole of the Tauric Chersonesus tributary to his kingdom. After the death of Parisades the kingdom of Bosporus itself was incorporated with his dominions. He was now in possession of such great power that he began to deem himself equal to a contest with Rome itself. Many causes of dissension had already arisen between them, but Mithridates had hitherto submitted to the mandates of Rome. Even after expelling Ariobarzanes from Cappadocia and Nicomedes from Bithynia in 90, he offered no resistance to the Romans when they restored these monarchs to their kingdom. But when Nicomedes, urged by the Roman legates, invaded the territories of Mithridates, the latter made preparations for immediate hostilities. His success was rapid and striking. In 88 he drove Ariobarzanes out of Cappadocia and Nicomedes out of Bithynia, defeated the Roman generals who had supported the latter, made himself master of Phrygia and Galatia, and at last of the Roman province of Asia. During the winter he issued the sanguinary order to all the cities of Asia to put to death, on the same day, all the Roman and Italian citizens who were to be found within their walls. So hateful had the Romans rendered themselves, that these commands were obeyed with alacrity by almost all the cities of Asia, and eighty thousand Romans and Italians are said to have perished in this fearful massacre. Meantime Sulla had received the command of the war against Mithridates, and crossed over into Greece in 87. Mithridates, however, had resolved not to await the Romans in Asia, but had already sent his general Archelaüs into Greece at the head of a powerful army. The war proved unfavourable to the king. Archelaüs was twice defeated by Sulla with immense loss near Chaeronea, and Orchomenus in Boeotia (86). About the same time Mithridates was himself defeated in Asia by Fimbria. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfimbria">Fimbria</ref>.) These disasters led him to sue for peace, which Sulla was willing to grant, because he was anxious to return to Italy, which was entirely in the hands of his enemies. Mithridates consented to abandon all his conquests in Asia, to pay a sum of two thousand talents, and to surrender to the Romans a fleet of seventy ships. Thus terminated the First Mithridatic War (84). Shortly afterwards Murena, who had been left in command of Asia by Sulla , invaded the dominions of Mithridates (83) under the pretext that the king had not yet evacuated the whole of Cappadocia. In the following year (82) Murena renewed his hostile incursions, but was defeated by Mithridates on the banks of the river Halys. But shortly afterwards Murena received peremptory orders from Sulla to desist from hostilities, in consequence of which peace was again restored. This is usually called the Second Mithridatic War. Mithridates, however, was well aware that the peace between him and Rome was in fact a mere suspension of hostilities, and that the Republic would never suffer the massacre of her citizens in Asia to remain ultimately unpunished. No formal treaty was ever concluded between Mithridates and the Roman Senate; and the king had in vain endeavoured to obtain the ratification of the terms agreed on between him and Sulla.</p>
 <p>The death of Nicomedes III., king of Bithynia, at the beginning of 74, brought matters to a crisis. 
<pb n="1049" /><cb /> That monarch left his dominions by will to the Roman people; and Bithynia was accordingly declared a Roman province; but Mithridates asserted that the late king had left a legitimate son by his wife Nysa, whose pretensions he immediately prepared to support by his arms. He had employed the last few years in forming a powerful army, armed and disciplined in the Roman manner; and he now took the field with one hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers, sixteen thousand horse, and a vast number of barbarian auxiliaries. This was the commencement of the Third Mithridatic War. The two Roman consuls, Lucullus and Cotta , were unable to oppose his first irruption. He traversed Bithynia without encountering any resistance, and when at length Cotta ventured to give him battle under the walls of Chalcedon, the consul was totally defeated both by sea and land. Mithridates then proceeded to lay siege to Cyzicus both by sea <figure id="fig.01049">
<head orig="Coin of Mithridates the Great.">Coin of Mithridates the Great.</head>
</figure> and land. Lucullus marched to the relief of the city, cut off the king's supplies, and eventually compelled him to raise the siege early in 73. On his retreat Mithridates suffered great loss, and eventually took refuge in Pontus. Hither Lucullus followed him in the next year. The new army which the king had collected was entirely defeated by the Roman general; and Mithridates, despairing of opposing the further progress of Lucullus, took refuge in the dominions of his son-in-law Tigranes, the king of Armenia. Tigranes at first showed no disposition to attempt the restoration of his father-in-law; but being offended at the haughty conduct of Appius Claudius, whom Lucullus had sent to demand the surrender of Mithridates, the Armenian king not only refused this request, but determined to prepare for war with the Romans. Accordingly, in 69, Lucullus marched into Armenia, defeated Tigranes and Mithridates near Tigranocerta, and in the next year (68) again defeated the allied monarchs near Artaxata. The Roman general then turned aside into Mesopotamia, and laid siege to Nisibis. Here the Roman soldiers broke out into open mutiny, and demanded to be led home; and Lucullus was obliged to raise the siege, and return to Asia Minor. Meanwhile Mithridates had taken advantage of the absence of Lucullus to invade Pontus at the head of a large army. He defeated Fabius and Triarius, to whom the defence of Pontus had been committed; and when Lucullus returned to Pontus, he was unable to resume the offensive in consequence of the mutinous spirit of his own soldiers. Mithridates was thus able, before the close of 67, to regain possession of the greater part of his hereditary dominions. In the following year (66) the conduct of the war was intrusted to Pompey. <cb /> Hostilities were resumed with greater vigour than ever. Mithridates was obliged to retire before the Romans; he was surprised and defeated by Pompey; and as Tigranes now refused to admit him into his own dominions, he resolved to plunge with his small army into the heart of Colchis, and thence make his way to the Palus Maeotis and the Cimmerian Bosporus. Arduous as this enterprise appeared, it was successfully accomplished; and he at length established himself without opposition at Panticapaeum, the capital of Bosporus. He had now nothing to fear from the pursuit of Pompey, who turned his arms first against Tigranes, and afterwards against Syria. Unable to obtain peace from Pompey, unless he would come in person to make his submission, Mithridates conceived the daring project of marching round the northern and western coasts of the Euxine, through the wild tribes of the Sarmatians and Getae, and, having gathered round his standard all these barbarous nations, to penetrate into Italy itself. But meanwhile disaffection had made rapid progress among his followers. His son Pharnaces at length openly rebelled against him. He was joined both by the whole army and the citizens of Panticapaeum, who unanimously proclaimed him king; and Mithridates, who had taken refuge in a strong tower, saw that no choice remained to him but death or captivity. Hereupon he took poison, which he constantly carried with him; but his constitution had been so long inured to antidotes that it did not produce the desired effect, and he was compelled to call in the assistance of one of his Gaulish mercenaries to dispatch him with his sword. He died in 63. His body was sent by Pharnaces to Pompey at Amisus, as a token of his submission; but the conqueror caused it to be interred with regal honours in the sepulchre of his forefathers at Sinopé. He was sixty-eight or sixty-nine years old at the time of his death, and had reigned fifty-seven years, of which twenty-five had been occupied, with only a few brief intervals, in one continued struggle against the Roman power. The estimation in which he was held by his adversaries is the strongest testimony to his great abilities: Cicero calls him the greatest of all kings after Alexander, and in another passage says that he was a more formidable opponent than any other monarch whom the Roman arms had yet encountered.

 <p>(8) Of Pergamus, son of Menodotus; but his mother having had an amour with Mithridates the Great, he was generally looked upon as, in reality, the son of that monarch. The king himself bestowed great care on his education; and he appears as early as 64 to have exercised the chief control over the affairs of his native city. At a subsequent period he served under Iulius Caesar in the Alexandrian War (48); and after the defeat of Pharnaces in the following year (47) Caesar bestowed upon Mithridates the kingdom of the Bosporus, and also the tetrarchy of the Galatians. But the kingdom of the Bosporus still remained to be won; for Asander, who had revolted against Pharnaces, was, in fact, master of the whole country, and Mithridates, having attempted to expel him, was defeated and slain.

The chief city of Lesbos, stood on the east side of the island opposite the coast of Lesbos, upon a promontory which was once an island, and both sides of which formed excellent harbours. Its first foundation is ascribed to Carians and Pelasgians. It was early colonized by the Aeolians. Important hints respecting its political history are furnished by the fragments of the poetry of Alcaeus, whence (and from other sources) it seems that, after the rule and overthrow of a series of tyrants, the city was nearly ruined by the bitter hatred and conflicts of the factions of the nobles and the people, till Pittacus was appointed to a sort of dictatorship, and the nobles were expelled. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalcaeus">Alcaeus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspittacus">Pittacus</ref>.) Meanwhile, the city had grown to great importance as a naval power, and had founded colonies on the coasts of Mysia and Thrace. At the beginning of the seventh century B.C. the possession of one of these colonies, Sigeum, at the mouth of the Hellespont, was disputed in war between the Mitylenaeans and Athenians, and assigned to the latter by the award of Periander, tyrant of Corinth. Among the other colonies of Mitylené were Achilleum, Assos, and Antandrus. Mitylené submitted to the Persians after the conquest of Ionia and Aeolis, and furnished contingents to the expeditions of Cambyses against Egypt and of Darius against Scythia. It was active in the Ionian revolt, after the failure of which it again became subject to Persia, and took part in the expedition of Xerxes against Greece.

A supposed king of Egypt, who is said to have dug, about B.C. 1350, the great lake known by his name. It covered over sixty square miles at the entrance to the Fayûm; and was really constructed by Amenemhat III. of the Twelfth Dynasty about B.C. 2300. It was employed for storing the water of the Nile for irrigation, and is now properly to be identified with the natural lake Borket-el-Kurûn. Herodotus says that the king erected two pyramids in 
<pb n="1052" /><cb />
 the lake, one supporting a statue of himself and the other a statue of his wife. Remains of these pyramids have been discovered in modern times. The name <title>Moeris</title> is the Egyptian <seg lang="la">meri</seg>, “a lake,” and no such king as Moeris ever lived.

It was bounded on the south by Thrace and Macedonia, on the west by Illyricum and Pannonia, on the north by the Danube, and on the east by the Pontus Euxinus, thus corresponding roughly to the present Servia and Bulgaria. This country was subdued in the reign of Augustus (B.C. 29), and was made a Roman province at the commencement of the reign of Tiberius. It was afterwards formed into two provinces, called Moesia Superior and Moesia Inferior, the former being the western and the latter the eastern half of the country. When Aurelian surrendered Dacia to the barbarians and removed the inhabitants of that province to the south of the Danube, the middle part of Moesia was called Dacia Aureliani.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀργυροκοπεῖον</foreign>). A mint. In Persia the king enjoyed the sole right of issuing gold money (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdaricus">Daricus</ref>); but the cities on the coast of Asia Minor coined copper, silver, and even electrum coins at pleasure; and the different satraps struck silver money bearing their own names. In Greece proper and the Greek colonies each State or <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign> issued such money as it chose, so that a great variety of Greek coins have come down to us. Fully 2000 mints are known to have existed prior to the fall of the Roman Empire (A.D. 410). Sicily had more than fifty different mints, and even the little island of Ceos had three. The cities of Magna Graecia in Italy issued coins of a general uniformity, as did the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues. Under the Romans the Greek cities ceased to coin silver money, except a few favoured ones like Antioch, the Cappadocian Caesarea, and Tarsus, though copper coins were still struck in many towns of Greece and Asia.</p>
 <p>As the Roman dominion extended over Italy, the State gradually put down the rival issues of Oscan, Etruscan, and other non-Latin coinages, and introduced a uniform system. At Rome, however, various personages at different times controlled the mintage. In the city, money was usually struck under the direction of three officials, the <seg lang="la">triumviri monetales;</seg> but generals in the field and abroad issued money as they found it necessary, placing upon it not only their names but their effigies. When Augustus assumed the supreme power he took to himself the sole right to issue gold and silver coins, leaving to the Senate the mintage of copper. Hence copper coins of the Empire bore the letters S. C., indicating that they were issued by authority of the Senate.</p>
 <p>The ancient processes of minting were very simple. One engraved die was let into an anvil, another into the end of a metal bar. Between the two was placed the blank, roughly cast into the required shape and size and heated red hot. A single blow of a heavy hammer on the upper end of the bar usually finished the coin, which was

 <p>A remarkable archaeologist and classical scholar, born at Brieg, in Silesia, August 28, 1797. He was educated at Breslau and at Berlin under Boeckh, and when only twenty-two years of age was made Professor Extraordinarius of Archaeology and Director of the Philological Seminary at the University of Göttingen <bibl default="NO">(1819)</bibl>, and Professor Ordinarius in 1823. In 1840, while in Greece, he died from the effects of a fever contracted at Delphi, where he had been copying inscriptions. Müller was the author of a number of works that were really epoch-making, in that they opened up questions upon which several generations of scholars have since been continuously at work, and he may be said to have permanently established archaeology upon a scientific basis.

<head orig="Multa">Multa</head>

 <p> (also spelled <hi rend="italic">mulcta</hi>, and possibly from <seg lang="la">mulgeo</seg>, “a milking”). The Roman term for a fine, inflicted either by a magistrate for disobedience or insubordination, or at the motion of an official by the decision of the people at the Comitia Tributa, or prescribed in laws, wills, etc., in case any one contravened them. It originally consisted in cattle, sheep, or oxen; then, after B.C. 430, the Lex Iulia Papiria permitted the payment in money according to a fixed scale (a sheep=10 <seg lang="la">asses</seg>, an ox=100 <seg lang="la">asses</seg>). The lowest amount of the <seg lang="la">multa</seg> inflicted by a magistrate in virtue of his office was a sheep; when acts of disobedience were repeated, the fine could be raised to 30 oxen (<seg lang="la">suprema multa</seg>). Against heavier penalties, such, in particular, as were imposed by the tribunes of the people on account of political crimes—e. g., when a general had waged war unskilfully or had exceeded the limits of his power—an appeal to the Comitia Tributa was granted, and they were decided by that body in the regular legal manner. The fines imposed by the people were always, and those imposed by the magistrates usually, set apart for sacred purposes; otherwise they fell to the Treasury, as was the rule under the Empire. This also received a part of the penalties fixed by laws; the other was given to the plaintiff. Fines for contravention of the clauses of a will were either paid to the funds of a temple or to the community to which the testator belonged, and at Rome to the Treasury.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>. A tribune of the plebs B.C. 187, and praetor 177.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Achaĭcus</hi>, son of the last, was praetor 154, when he carried on the war successfully in further Spain against the Lusitanians. He was consul in 146, when he won for himself the surname of Achaicus by the conquest of Greece and the establishment of the Roman province of Achaia. After defeating the army of the Achaean League at the isthmus of Corinth, he entered Corinth without opposition. The city was burned, razed, and abandoned to pillage; the native Corinthians were sold for slaves, and the rarest specimens of Grecian art were given up to the rapacity of an ignorant conqueror. Polybius, the historian, saw Roman soldiers playing at draughts upon the far-famed picture of Dionysus by Aristides; and Mummius himself was so unconscious of the real value of his prize that he sold the rarer works of painting, sculpture, and carving to the king of Pergamus, and took bonds from the masters of vessels who conveyed the remainder to Italy to replace by equivalents any picture or statue lost or injured in the passage (Polyb. iii. 32; xl. 7-11; Vell. Paterc. i. 13). He remained in Greece during the greater part of 145 with the title of proconsul. He arranged the fiscal and municipal constitution of the newly-acquired province, and won the confidence and esteem of the provincials by his integrity, justice, and equanimity. He triumphed in 145. He was censor in <cb /> 142 with Scipio Africanus the younger. The political opinions of Mummius inclined to the popular side.</p>

 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossmunicipium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Municipium">Municipium</head>

 <p> Originally the Roman term for a town the inhabitants of which, called <hi rend="italic">municipes</hi>, possessed only part of the rights of Roman citizenship—viz., the private rights of <seg lang="la">commercium</seg> and <seg lang="la">conubium</seg>, while they were excluded from the political rights, the <seg lang="la">ius suffragii</seg> and the <seg lang="la">ius honorum</seg>, the right to elect and to be elected to office. As Roman citizens, they did not serve (like the allies) in cohorts under a prefect, but in the legions under tribunes; they were, however, assigned to legions distinct from the others, since they were not inscribed on the lists of the Roman tribes, and therefore could not be levied in accordance with those lists. After the dissolution of the Latin League in B.C. 338, the allied towns were put into the position of municipia.</p>
 <p>At first there were two classes of municipia, according as they retained an independent communal constitution or not. The second class, which had no senate, magistrates, or popular assembly of its own, and was governed directly by Rome, consisted of the <seg lang="la">praefecturae</seg> (q. v.). As the municipia gradually obtained the full rights of citizenship, their nature changed; all persons were now called <hi rend="italic">municipes</hi>, who did not belong to the town of Rome by birth, but were full Roman citizens; and hence belonged to a Roman tribe, were registered at Rome, could elect and be elected to office, and served in the Roman legions.</p>
 <p>The Lex Iulia of B.C. 90 made all the towns of Italy municipia with full civic rights, and every Italian country town was now called a Roman municipium. Gradually the towns in the provinces received municipal rights, till finally Caracalla made all towns of the Empire municipia. Originally one class of municipia had retained their own laws and their own constitution; this arrangement underwent a change when they were 
<pb n="1058" /><cb />
 received into the Roman citizenship, inasmuch as the Roman law then became binding upon them, and a regularly organized administration on the Roman model was introduced. The citizens were divided into <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>, and at their Comitia Curiata passed all kinds of decrees, and chose officers; most of these rights, however, passed into the hands of the local senate towards the end of the first century. This senate usually consisted of 100 life-members, called <seg lang="la">decuriones</seg>, and in every fifth year the vacancies were filled up from those who had held office or were qualified by their property. The highest officials were the <seg lang="la">duo viri</seg>, who were judges and presided at the assemblies of the people, especially at elections, and in the senate; the two <seg lang="la">quinquennales</seg>, chosen for a year, once in five years, and corresponding to the Roman censors; and <seg lang="la">quaestores</seg> and <seg lang="la">aediles</seg>, officials with similar duties to the Roman officials of the same name. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>.) Besides the decuriones, whose position became hereditary at the end of the Empire, there were, under the heathen emperors, a second privileged class, known as Augustales, chosen by decree of the local senate and next to that body in rank. They made up a collegium, which was originally dedicated to the worship of the Julian family, and in later times seems to have extended its functions to the worship of the other emperors. The decline of the municipal system, the prosperity of which had depended on the liberty and independence of the administration, set in at the end of the second century after Christ, when the emperors began to transfer to the municipia the burdens of the State, and the decuriones gradually became mere imperial officials, who were more especially responsible for the collection of the tribute imposed.

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crosslicinius">Licinius</ref>.

(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius</hi>, a man of some literary knowledge,

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, brother of the preceding, served under Sulla in Greece in the Mithridatic War. After Sulla had made peace with Mithridates (84), Murena was left as propraetor in Asia. Anxious for distinction, Murena sought a quarrel with Mithridates; and after carrying on the war for two years, was at length compelled, by the strict orders of Sulla , to stop hostilities. Murena returned to Rome, and had a triumph in 81. He probably died soon after.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, son of the last, served under his father in the Second Mithridatic War and also under Lucullus in the Third Mithridatic War. In 65 he was praetor, in 64 propraetor of Gallia Cisalpina, and in 63 was elected consul with D. Iunius Silanus. Sulpicius, an unsuccessful candidate, instituted a prosecution against Murena for bribery (<seg lang="la">ambitus</seg>), and he was supported in the matter by M. Porcius Cato, Cn. Postumius, and Serv. Sulpicius the Younger. Murena was defended by Q. Hortensius, M. Tullius Cicero, who was then consul, and M. Licinius Crassus. The speech of Cicero, which is extant, was delivered in the latter part of November. The orator handled his subject skilfully by joking about the formulae and the practice of the lawyers, to which class Sulpicius belonged, and with the paradoxes of the Stoics, to which sect Cato had attached himself. Murena was acquitted, and was consul in the following year, 62.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">A. Terentius Varro Murēna</hi>, probably the son of the preceding, was adopted by A. Terentius Varro, whose name he took, according to the custom in such cases. In the Civil Wars, he is said to have lost his property, and C. Proculeius, a Roman knight, is said to have given him a share of his own property. This Proculeius is called the brother of Varro; but, if we take the words of Horace literally ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>ii. 2</bibl>), Proculeius had more than one brother. It is conjectured that this Proculeius was a son of the brother of No. 3, who had been adopted by one Proculeius. This would make Proculeius the cousin of Varro. It was common enough among the Romans to call cousins by the name of brothers (<seg lang="la">frater patruelis</seg> and <seg lang="la">frater</seg>). In 25 Murena subdued the Salassi in the Alps, and founded the town of Augusta (<title>Aosta</title>) in their territory. He was consul suffectus in 23. In 22 he was involved in the conspiracy of Fannius Caepio, and was condemned to death and executed, notwithstanding the intercession of Proculeius and Terentia, the sister of Murena and wife of Maecenas.

Muretus was a brilliant stylist of the Italian or “Ciceronian” school of modern Latinity, and wrote Latin with the ease and purity of an ancient Roman. Many of his orations are absolutely faultless, so that for many generations they were read in the schools of Europe side by side with Cicero and Livy.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Moenia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τεῖχος</foreign>). A wall surrounding an unroofed enclosure, as opposed to <seg lang="la">paries</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖχος</foreign>), the wall of a building. The word <seg lang="la">maceria</seg> denotes a boundary wall, fence-wall. Cities were enclosed by walls at a very early period of Greek history, as is shown by the epithet used by Homer —“well-walled”—of Tiryns, Mycenae, etc., and the massive remains of those cities have also demonstrated the fact So vast, in truth, are some of these structures as to have induced a belief among the ancients that they were the work of Cyclopes.

</figure> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclopes">Cyclopes</ref>.) The following principal species of city walls are to be distinguished: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) those in which the masses of stone are of irregular shape and put together loosely, the interstices being filled by smaller stones, as in the wall at Tiryns (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstiryns">Tiryns</ref>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) those in which polygonal stones are carefully fitted together, and their faces cut so as to give the whole a comparatively smooth surface, as in the walls at Larissa and at Cenchreae (see the second illustration on page 452); and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) those in which the blocks are laid in horizontal courses more or less regular with the vertical joints either perpendicular or oblique, and are more or less accurately fitted together, as in the walls beside the “Lion Gate” at Mycenae. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref>.</p>
 <p>Brick was largely used in Egypt, Assyria, and Chaldaea, and also in Greece and Italy; but was often defended against the weather by an outer casing of stone, when the bricks were sun-dried instead of burned. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfictile">Fictilé</ref>.) After the first Persian War the Athenians began to use marble for their finest buildings, as in the Propylaea (q. v.) and the Parthenon. A century later marble was also used for facing walls of brick. Less important structures were made of smaller stones, rough or square, flints, or bricks.</p>
 <p>At Rome there were several kinds of masonry. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaementum">Caementum</ref>.) (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Blocks of stone were laid in alternate conrses, lengthwise in one course and crosswise in the next. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The stones in each course were laid alternately along and across. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The stones were laid all lengthwise. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The stones entirely crosswise. (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) The courses were alternately higher and lower than each other. The earliest walls at Rome, largely of Etruscan origin, were built of huge quadrangular stones, hewn, and placed together without cement. Such were the Carcer Mamertinus (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscarcer">Carcer</ref>), the Cloaca Maxima (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>), and the Servian Walls (see <ref type="cross" target="crossetruria">Etruria</ref>, p. 628). The Romans also used small rough stones, not laid in courses, but held together by mortar (<seg lang="la">opus incertum</seg>) and <cb /> courses of flat tiles. Tiles were also introduced in the stone and brick walls. Brick covered with painted stucco was a very common material at Rome, and even columns were so constructed.</p>

When the emperor was seriously ill, and had been made worse by a hot regimen and treatment, B.C. 23, Antonius Musa succeeded in restoring him to health by means of cold bathing and cooling drinks, for which service he received from Augustus and the Senate a large sum of money and permission to wear a gold ring; and also had a statue erected in his honour by public subscription near that of Aesculapius. He seems to have been attached to this mode of treatment, to which Horace alludes (<title>Epist.</title> i. 15, 3), but failed when he applied it to the case of M. Marcellus, who died under his care a few months after the recovery of Augustus, B.C. 23. He wrote several pharmaceutical works, which are frequently quoted by Galen, but of which nothing except a few fragments remains, edited by Caldani <bibl default="NO">(Bassano, 1800)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μοῦσαι</foreign>). In Greek mythology the Muses were originally the nymphs of springs, whose waters gave inspiration, such as Hippocrené, Castalia, etc.; then goddesses of song in general; and afterwards the representatives of the various kinds of poetry, arts, and sciences. In Homer, who now speaks of one, and now of many Muses, but without specifying their number or their names, they are considered goddesses dwelling in Olympus, who at the meals of the gods sing sweetly to the lyre of Apollo, inspire the poet and prompt his song. Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 52-76) calls them the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyné, born in Pieria, and mentions their names, to which we shall at the same time add the province and the attributes afterwards assigned to each.

 <p>Three older Muses were sometimes distinguished from these. Meleté (Meditation), Mnemé (Remembrance), Aoidé (Song), whose worship was said to have been introduced by the Aloadae, Otus and Ephialtes, near Mount Helicon. Thracian settlers in the Pierian district at the foot of Olympus and of Helicon in Boeotia are usually mentioned as the original founders of this worship. At both these places were their oldest sanctuaries. According to the general belief, the favourite haunts of the Muses were certain springs, near which temples and statues had been erected in their honour: Castalia, at the foot of Mount Parnassus, and Aganippé and Hippocrené, on Helicon, near the towns of Ascra and Thespiae. After the decline of Ascra, the inhabitants of Thespiae attended to the worship of the Muses and to the arrangements for the musical contests in their honour that took place once in five years. They were also adored in many other places in Greece. Thus the Athenians offered them sacrifices in the schools, while the Spartans did so before battle. As the inspiring nymphs of springs they were early connected with Dionysus; the god of poets, Apollo, is looked on as their leader (<foreign lang="greek">Μουσαγέτης</foreign>), with whom they share the knowledge of past, present, and future. As beings that gladden men and gods with their song, Hesiod describes them as dwelling on Olympus along with the Charites and Himeros. They were represented in art as virgin goddesses with long garments of many folds, and frequently with a cloak besides; they were not distinguished by special attributes till comparatively later times. See <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Musen in der antiken Kunst</title> (Berlin, 1887)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The Roman poets identified them with the Italian <ref type="cross" target="crosscamenae">Camēnae</ref>, prophetic nymphs of springs and goddesses of birth, who had a grove at Rome outside the Porta Capena. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossegeria">Egeria</ref>.) The Greeks gave the title of Muses to their nine most distinguished poetesses: Praxilla, Moero , Anyté, Erinna, Telesilla, Corinna, Nossis, Myrtis, and Sappho.

<head orig="Musēum">Museum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Μουσεῖον</foreign>). Originally a temple of the Muses, then a place dedicated to the works of the Muses. In this sense the most remarkable and most important museum of antiquity was that established at Alexandria by Ptolemy Philadelphus in the first half of the third century B.C., or perhaps by his father, Ptolemy Soter. This institution contributed very largely towards the preservation and extension of Greek literature and learning. It was a spacious and magnificent edifice, supplied with everything requisite for its purpose, such as an observatory, a library, a portico (<foreign lang="greek">περίπατος</foreign>), a public lecture-room (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξέδρα</foreign>), and a large hall or common-room where the professors dined together. There were also botanical and zoölogical gardens. It lay near the royal palace and communicated immediately with the temple of the Muses. Noted men of erudition were there supported at the cost of the State, to enable them to devote themselves to their learned studies without interruption. They were under the supervision of principals chosen from their own body, while the priest of the Muses was at their head. The Museum was practically, therefore, a great university. Its scholars formed four faculties—letters, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine; and there are said to have been at one time as many as 14,000 students in attendance. Under the Roman emperors, when Egypt had become a province of the Empire, it was still continued as an imperial institute and the centre of all learning, especially in mathematics and astronomy (Strabo, p. 794). Caracalla confiscated the pensions of the learned men attached to it, and the institution itself was completely destroyed during the Civil Wars under Aurelian in the third century.</p>
 <p>The Alexandrian Museum was probably suggested by the Museum at Athens founded in accordance with the will of Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle ( <bibl n="Diog.  5. 5" default="NO">Diog. Laert.v. 5</bibl>). This may have taken its name from the earlier <foreign lang="greek">Μουσεῖον</foreign> at Stagira, Aristotle's birthplace. The Athenian Museum was like that of Alexandria in its general purpose, though on a much smaller scale. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseducation">Education</ref>, p. 572; and for the Alexandrian Library attached to the Museum, the article <ref type="cross" target="crossbibliotheca">Bibliotheca</ref>.

<div2 id="crossmusica" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Musĭca">Musica</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>, “art of the Muses”). A term which included among the Greeks everything that belonged to a higher intellectual and artistic education. Plato ( <title>Rep.</title>p. 136), while discussing education, speaks of “gymnastic for the body and music for the soul,” and ranks literature under the head of music. Music in the narrower sense was regarded by the Greeks both as an agreeable amusement and as one of the most effective means of cultivating the feelings and the character. The great importance they attached <cb /> to music is also shown by their idea that it was of divine origin; Hermes or Apollo is said to have invented the lyre, Athené the simple flute, Pan the shepherd's pipe. Besides these gods and the Muses, Dionysus also was connected with music. Numerous myths, as, for instance, those concerning Amphion and Orpheus, tell of its mighty power, and testify to the Greeks having cultivated music at a very early epoch. It was always intimately allied to poetry. Originally epic poems were also sung to the accompaniment of the cithara, and the old masters of poetry, such as Orpheus and Musaeus, are at the same time masters of music, just as in historical times the lyric and dramatic poets were at the same time the composers of their works. It was not until the Alexandrian Age that the poet ceased to be also a musician. Owing to its connection with poetry, music developed in the same proportion and flourished at the same period as lyric and dramatic poetry. Of the Greek races, the Dorians and Aeolians had a special genius and capacity for music, and among both are found the first traces of its development as an art.</p>
 <p>The actual foundation of the classical music of the Greeks is ascribed to <ref type="cross" target="crossterpander">Terpander</ref> (q.v.), of the Aeolian island of Lesbos, who, in Dorian Sparta (about B.C. 675), first gave a truly artistic form to song accompanied by the cithara, and especially to the citharodic <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>. In the Peloponnesian school of the Terpandridae, who followed his teaching and formed a closely united guild, <foreign lang="greek">κιθαρῳδική</foreign> received its further artistic development. What Terpander had done for <foreign lang="greek">κιθαρῳδική</foreign> was done not long afterwards by Clonas of Thebes or Tegea for <foreign lang="greek">αὐλῳδική</foreign>, or song accompanied by the flute. The artistic flute-playing which had been elaborated by the Phrygian Olympus in Asia, was introduced by Clonas into the Peloponnesus, which long remained the principal seat of all musical art. Of the two kinds of independent instrumental music, which throughout presupposes the development of vocal music and always adapts itself to this as its model, the earlier is the music on the flute (<foreign lang="greek">αὐλητική</foreign>), which was especially brought into favourable notice by Sacadas of Argos (about B.C. 580), while the music on stringed instruments (<foreign lang="greek">κιθαριστική</foreign>) is later. Music was much promoted by the contests at the public festivals, above all by those at the Pythian Games. Its highest point of development was attained in the time of the Persian Wars, which seems to have seen the completion of the ancient system as it had been elaborated by the tradition of the schools. The lyric poets of this time, as Pindar and Simonides, the dramatists, as Phrynichus and Aeschylus, were held by the critics to be unsurpassable models. What was added in subsequent times can hardly be called a new development of the art. Athens in her golden age was the central city where professional musicians met one another— Athens the home of Greek dramatic poetry. At this time vocal combined with instrumental music largely prevailed over instrumental music alone. The latter was chiefly limited to solo performances.</p>
 <p>Ancient vocal music is distinguished in one important point from ours: throughout classical times part-singing was unknown. There was at most a difference of octaves, and that only when men and boys sang in the same choir. Theoretically, however, the Greeks were acquainted with some of the effects upon which harmonic systems are 
<pb n="1063" /><cb />
 based, though in practice the nature of their harmonics was extremely simple, with no sure trace of chords or groups of more than two notes. Again, in classical times, the music was subordinate to the words, and was therefore necessarily much simpler than it is now. It is only in this way that we can explain the fact that an ancient audience could follow the musical representation of the often intricate language of the odes, even when the odes were sung by the whole choir. Critics regarded it as a decline of art when, at the end of the Peloponnesian War, the music began to be the important element instead of the poetry. This change took place at first in single branches of the art, as in the solos (<foreign lang="greek">μονῳδίαι</foreign>) in tragedy and in the dithyrambic choruses. Thenceforward ancient music, like modern music, raised itself more and more to a free and independent position beside that of poetry.</p>
 <p>The first place among the various kinds of music was assigned to the indigenous citharodic art, which was connected with the first development of the musical art; and, indeed, stringed instruments were always more esteemed than wind instruments, in part on account of the greater technical difficulties which had to be overcome, and which led to musicians giving particular attention to them. Moreover, playing on the flute <figure /> was limited to certain occasions, as its sound seemed to the ancients to arouse enthusiasm and passion ( <title>Polit.</title> viii. 3). There is evidence that, on the one hand, the ancient theory of singing and of instrumentation, in spite of the primitive nature of the instruments, was brought to a high degree of perfection; and that, on the other hand, the public must have possessed a severely critical judgment in matters of music. The characteristic feature of ancient music is the great clearness of its form, resulting, above all, from the extreme precision of the rhythmic treatment.</p>
 <p>This was not the only point in which ancient music differed from modern music; it also differed from it in the number of its modes. The modes were distinguished from one another by the place of the semitones in the octave. While modern music has only two modes, the major and the minor, the Greek had seven. These seven modes, the names of which are taken from the three great Greek races and the neighbouring Asiatic nations (Dorian, Aeolian or Hypodorian, Ionian or Hypophrygian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Hypolydian), were all employed at some time in the classical period, though they did not all of them come into use at the same date. It is significant of the distinction between ancient and modern music that of these modes the Dorian, which was the oldest and the lowest in pitch, and is described as dignified, severe, and grave, was most extensively used in all kinds of music.</p>
 <p>As the basis of every melodic series of sounds the ancients had the <hi rend="italic">tetrachord</hi>, a scale of four notes, to which, according to tradition, the earliest <cb /> music was limited. The <hi rend="italic">heptachord</hi> was certainly in use before Terpander, who is said to have given the lyre seven strings instead of four (Strabo, p. 618); but Pausanias (iii. 12. 10) states with greater accuracy that he added four strings to the previously existing seven. The heptachord consisted of two tetrachords, as the central note was at once the highest of the first and the lowest of the second tetrachord.</p>
 <p>Next came the <hi rend="italic">octachord</hi> or octave, and at last, after various additions, the following scale of notes was formed:</p>
 <p>From the lowest <seg lang="la">b</seg> on ward, this scale was divided into tetrachords in such a way that the fourth note was always also regarded as the first of the following tetrachord; the intervals between the sounds of the tetrachord were, in ascending order, semitone, tone, tone. This sequence was called the “diatonic genus.” Besides this there was also the “chromatic,” the tetrachords of which were as follows: <seg lang="la">b c <figure /> d e f <figure /> g a</seg> (the intervals in this case were semitone, semitone, tone and a half). Thirdly, there was the “enharmonic,” the tetrachord of which had for its intervals 1/4 tone, 1/4 tone, 2 tones, and accordingly cannot be expressed in modern notation.</p>
 <p>The musical notation (<foreign lang="greek">σημασία</foreign>) of the Greeks consisted of two distinct systems of signs—one for the voice, the other for the instrument. The vocal signs are taken from the common or Ionic alphabet. The notes of the middle part of the scale are denoted by the letters in their usual order; those of the lower part by an alphabet of inverted or otherwise altered letters; the upper notes are distinguished by accents—an accent signifying that the note is an octave higher than that of the unaccented letter. The following is a brief summary of Westphal's discoveries:</p>
 <p>(1) The instrumental notation was derived from the first fourteen letters of a Peloponnesian alphabet, possessing <seg lang="la">digamma</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign>, the old form of <seg lang="la">iota</seg>, <figure />, and two forms of <hi rend="italic">lambda</hi>, <figure /> and <figure />. In a few cases the forms of the letters have been modified: thus <seg lang="la">alpha</seg> (originally <figure />) appears as <figure />, <seg lang="la">beta</seg> as <figure />, <seg lang="la">delta</seg> as <figure />, <hi rend="italic">theta</hi> as <figure />, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> (originally <figure />) as <figure />, <seg lang="la">iota</seg> as <figure />. By treating the two forms of <hi rend="italic">lambda</hi> as distinct characters the number is raised to fifteen.
 </p>
 <p>(2) These characters are applied to denote a scale of two octaves, as follows: <figure /></p>
 <p>The arrangement of the letters is worth notice. The inventor began by taking <seg lang="la">alpha</seg> for the highest note of his scale. Then he took the other characters in pairs, <figure />, and made each pair stand for the extreme notes of an octave. This scale may be regarded as the framework of the system of notation.
 </p>
 <p>(3) A character may be varied by being reversed —i. e. written from right to left (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπεστραμμένον</foreign>), or by being turned half round backward (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνεστραμμένον, ὕπτιον</foreign>). When reversed, it denotes a note half a tone higher; when half reversed, it denotes a note a quarter of a tone higher. The 
<pb n="1064" /><cb />
 combination of the two varieties evidently gives an Enharmonic <foreign lang="greek">πυκνόν</foreign>, or group obtained by dividing a semitone—e. g. if we take the four “stable” notes of the central octave, <figure />, we complete the scale in the Enharmonic genus by inserting the varieties of <figure /> and <figure />, thus obtaining <figure />.</p>
 <p>In some cases this method of varying the letters is impracticable—e. g. <figure /> reversed does not change; <figure /> half-reversed becomes <figure />, and vice versa. Other modifications are accordingly employed, and we have the groups <figure />, and <figure />.
 </p>
 <p>(4) In the Diatonic genus the second lowest note of a tetrachord is not represented, as we should expect, by the reversed letter, but by the halfreversed one, the same character as the second lowest Enharmonic note.
 </p>
 <p>(5) In the Chromatic genus the characters used are the same as in the Enharmonic, but the reversed letter is distinguished by an accent. Thus the Chromatic tetrachord <seg lang="la">e f f #a</seg> is written <figure /> or (in the upper octave) <figure />.
 </p>
 <p>(6) The system was enlarged by the addition of two tones, each with the corresponding <foreign lang="greek">πυκνόν</foreign>, at the lower end of the scale, and an octave, except the highest note, at the upper end. The two groups were denoted by the characters <figure /> and <figure />, <figure id="fig.01064">
<head orig="Fragment found at Delphi in 1893 with part of a Hymn to Apollo in musical notation.">Fragment found at Delphi in 1893 with part of a Hymn to Apollo in musical notation.</head>
</figure> which are evidently invented on the analogy of the letters already in use. The new upper notes were denoted by accented letters, <figure /> to <figure />, repeating the scale from <figure /> to <figure /> an octave higher.</p>
 <p>We now have only seven pieces of ancient music whose authenticity is practically undisputed—the beginning of the First Pythian Ode of Pindar (see Boeckh's Pindar, <title>De Metris Pindari</title>, iii. 12); two <cb /> hymns to Calliopé and Apollo, ascribed to one Dionysius (q. v. 4); a papyrus fragment of the music of a chorus of Euripides (<title>Orestes</title>, 338-344); an inscription found at Tralles in 1883, giving a musical setting to four short gnomes; a hymn of <ref type="cross" target="crossmesomedes">Mesomedes</ref> (q.v.) of the second century after Christ, published, with fac-similes, in Bellermann's <bibl default="NO"><title>Hymnen des Dionysius und Mesomedes</title> (Berlin, 1840)</bibl>; and the fragments of a hymn found inscribed at Delphi in 1893. This last appears to be composed in a mood identical with the modern minor. It was composed after the repulse of the Gauls from Delphi in B.C. 279 and was first published in the <title>Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique</title>, xvii. 569-610. The fragments of this hymn are fourteen in number; and from them various reconstructions of the piece reduced to the modern system of notation have been published, one of which was performed before the king of Greece at Athens not long after the discovery of the inscription. See the work by Monro cited at the end of the article.</p>
 <p>Besides the pieces cited above there are also a few passages in the nature of short instrumental exercises; and a hymn to Demeter, first published by the Venetian composer Marcello, but regarded by Gevaert and other scholars as of very doubtful authenticity.</p>
 <p>With regard to the musical instruments it may be mentioned that only stringed instruments (see especially <ref type="cross" target="crosscithara">Cithara</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosslyra">Lyra</ref>) and the flute, which closely resembled our clarionet, were employed in music proper (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstibia">Tibia</ref>); and that the other instruments, such as trumpets (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssalpinx">Salpinx</ref>), Pan's pipes (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssyrinx">Syrinx</ref>), cymbals (<seg lang="la">cymbala</seg>), and kettledrums (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstympanum">Tympanum</ref>), were not included within its province.</p>
 <p>In proportion to the amount of attention paid to music by the Greeks, it early became the subject of learned research and literary treatment. The philosopher Pythagoras occupied himself with musical acoustics; he succeeded in representing numerically the relations of the octave, the fifth, and the fourth. For representing the symphonic relations the Pythagorean School invented the monochord or canon, a string stretched over a soundingboard and with a movable bridge, by means of which the string could be divided into different lengths; it was on this account known as the school of the Canonici as opposed to the Harmonici, who opposed this innovation and continued to be satisfied with a system of scales (“harmonics”) sung by the sole guidance of the ear. Among the Canonici were philosophers such as Philolaüs, Archytas, Democritus, Plato, and Aristotle. Lasus of Hermioné, the master of Pindar, is mentioned as the first author of a theoretical work on music. The “harmonic” <ref type="cross" target="crossaristoxenus">Aristoxenus</ref> (q.v.) Tarentum, a pupil of Aristotle, was held by the ancients to be the greatest authority on music; from his numerous works was drawn the greatest part of subsequent musical literature. Of other writers on music we may mention the well-known mathematician Euclid, and the great astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus, who perfected musical acoustics.</p>
 <p>Among the Romans a native development of music was completely wanting. They had, indeed, 
<pb n="1065" /><cb /> an ancient indigenous musical instrument, the short and slender Latin flute with four holes; but their national art of flute-playing was, at an early period, thrown into the background by the Etruscan, which was practised as a profession by foreigners, freedmen, and people of the lowest classes of the Roman population. Among the nine old guilds, said to have been instituted by King Numa, there was one of fluteplayers (<seg lang="la">tibicines</seg>), who assisted at public sacrifices. With the Greek drama, Greek dramatic music was also introduced; it was, however, limited to fluteplaying. Stringed instruments were not originally known at Rome, and were not frequently employed till after the Second Punic War. Indeed, as Greek usages and manners in general gained ground with the beginning of the second century, so also did Greek music. Greek dances and musical entertainments became common at the meals of aristocratic families, and the younger members of respectable households received instruction in music as in dancing. Though it was afterwards one of the subjects of higher education, it was never considered a real and effective means of training. Entertainments like our concerts became frequent towards the end of the Republic, and formed part of the musical contests instituted by Nero, a great lover of music, in A.D. 60, on the model of the Greek contests. Domitian had an “Odeum” built on the Campus Martius for the musical entertainments of the Agon Capitolinus, instituted by him in A.D. 86, and celebrated at intervals of four years to the end of the classical period. Passages bearing on music in Roman literature have no independent value, as they are entirely drawn from Greek sources, as in the writings of Martianus Capella and Boetius.

<div2 id="crossmusivum-opus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Musīvum Opus">Musivum Opus</head>

 <p> Mosaic. The term mosaic is usually derived from a post-classical word <seg lang="la">musivum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μουσεῖον</foreign>), occurring in Spartianus (<title>Vit. Pescenn.</title> 6, <seg lang="la">pictum de musivo</seg>), and St. Augustine (<title>De Civ. Dei</title>, xvi. 8, <seg lang="la">hominum genera musivo picta</seg>). It is the art of arranging small cubes or <seg lang="la">tesserae</seg> of marble, coloured stone, terra-cotta, glass, or some other artificial substance, so as to produce an ornamental pattern or picture, and to provide a durable form <cb /> of decoration for walls and pavements. The only mosaic hitherto found in Greece Proper is that discovered in 1829, in the floor of the east portico of the temple of Zeus, at Olympia, possibly little later than the first half of the fourth century B.C. It is formed of rough round pebbles of various colours from the bed of the Alpheus, and it represents Tritons of graceful design surrounded by a tasteful border of palmettes and meandering lines.</p>
 <p>The earliest mosaics mentioned in literature are those made for the ship of Hiero II., about the middle of the third century, with scenes from the <title>Iliad</title>, which took 300 skilled workmen a whole year to execute (Athenaeus, 206 <hi rend="SmallCaps">d</hi>). To the same age belongs the only artist in mosaic whose name is recorded in literature, Sosus of Pergamun, famous as the inventor of a kind of mosaic called the <foreign lang="greek">ἀσάρωτον</foreign> (the “unswept” floor), in which the floor of a room is inlaid with representations of fruits, fishes, and fragments of food that have fallen from the table (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  184" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 184</bibl>; cf. Statius, <title>Silvae</title> i. 3, 36). Mosaics of this type have been found not only at Pompeii, but also at Aquileia and in Algiers (see p. 825). According to Pliny , the original design by Sosus included a remarkable representation of a dove drinking and casting the shadow of its head on the water beneath, while several other doves were to be seen sunning themselves on the rim of the bowl. The best-known copy of this is that called “The Capitoline Doves,” found at Hadrian's Villa near Tivoli. It is entirely composed of cubes of marble, without any admixture of coloured glass.</p>
 <p>The art of reproducing paintings in mosaic probably originated in Egypt, and thence found its <figure id="fig.01065">
<head orig="The Capitoline Doves. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)">The Capitoline Doves. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> way to Greece and Italy. It is doubtless connected in its origin with the brick-work and tiling of Egypt and Mesopotamia. In fact, just as wallpaintings were first suggested by tapestries, so mosaic work is a natural development from carpets. All these arts, indeed, were closely related, and the subjects of paintings are also used by the makers of mosaic. One of the finest pieces of mosaic at Pompeii, signed by Dioscorides of Samos, reproduces a wall-painting found in the same city. The largest mosaic picture of Roman workmanship is that executed for the temple 
<pb n="1066" /><cb />
 of Fortune at Praenesté, restored by Sulla (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 189" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 189</bibl>). This was discovered in 1640, and is generally supposed to represent a popular <seg lang="la">fête</seg> on the occasion of an inundation of the Nile. It probably belongs to the time of Hadrian.</p>
 <p>Among the mosaics of Pompeii the most famous is that identified as the “Battle of Issus,” possibly a copy of the painting of the same subject by a female artist, Helena, “daughter of Timon the Egyptian,” which was placed in the Temple of Peace in the time of Vespasian (Photius,  <title>Bibl.</title>p. 482). It represents the critical moment when Alexander is charging, bare-headed, in the thick of the fray, and has just transfixed with his lance one of the leaders of the Persians; while Darius, with his lofty tiara and red chlamys, is extending his right hand in an attitude of alarm and despair. In the mosaic itself the lower border represents a river, apparently the Nile, with a crocodile, hippopotamus, ichneumon, ibis, etc., thus confirming the con<figure id="fig.01066">
<head orig="Threshold in Mosaic. (Pompeii.)">Threshold in Mosaic. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> jecture as to the Egyptian origin of the design. See illustrations, pp. 296 and 890.</p>
 <p>Mosaics bearing the artist's name are seldom found. The two finest of this class are those from Pompeii inscribed with the name of Dioscorides of Samos. One of these represents four masked figures playing on various instruments. The work is composed of very small pieces of glass, of the most beautiful colours and in various shades. (See Dyer's <title>Pompeii</title>, p. 276). Another of similar construction portrays a rehearsal for a satyric drama. The ground is black, the drapery mainly white, but the robe of the flute-player is bordered with purple, the lips are a bright red, and the flutes and ornaments coloured like gold. The finest mosaic of the early part of the second century A.D. is the highly pictorial centaur-mosaic now at Berlin, found at the Villa of Hadrian (Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler</title>, fig. 941). The most celebrated works of a later date include that in the Thermae of Caracalla, with numerous gladiatorial figures of colossal size and ungraceful drawing (ib. fig. 174); and that of the Roman villa at Nennig, near Trèves. The dimensions of the latter are fifty feet by thirtythree, and the design includes several groups of figures enclosed in a square or hexagonal framework of tessellated marble <bibl default="NO">(ib. figs. 1001-2343)</bibl>. Among the mosaics in the British Museum are an Amphitrité and Tritons, with Dionysus, Meleager, and Atalanta, all from Halicarnassus, and of Roman times, since figures of Dido and Aeneas were found in the same villa (Newton's <title>Travels and Discoveries</title>, ii. 76). Among mosaics still preserved in England may be mentioned those at Woodchester, Bignor, and Brading.</p>
 <p>Mosaic pavements are known by different names descriptive of certain varieties of structure. (1) A <seg lang="la">pavimentum sectile</seg> is composed of thin plates of coloured marble of various sizes, cut (<seg lang="la">secta</seg>) into slices of regular form and arranged in an ornamental <cb /> geometrical pattern including triangles, hexagons, etc. ( <bibl n="Suet. Vit. 7. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Vit.vii. 1</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Vit. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> Vit., 3</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Vit. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> Vit., 4</bibl>;  <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 46" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>46</bibl> fin.).</p>
 <p>(2) The epithet <seg lang="la">tessellatum</seg> describes a pavement of the same general kind, but made up of regular square dies (<seg lang="la">tesserae, tessellae, tesserulae</seg>), forming rectangular designs.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Vermiculatum</title> is applied to a design formed of small pieces of marble in various colours, arranged so as to imitate the object represented with a high degree of pictorial effect. The dies are of different shapes, so as to allow of their following the wavy contours of the outline of the object. The name owes its origin to the fact that the general effect of such an arrangement resembles the contortions of a cluster of worms (<seg lang="la">vermes</seg>). (Cf. Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 2</bibl>; and Lucilius, quoted in Cicero's <title>Orator</title>, 149.)</p>
 <p>(4) The term <seg lang="la">lithostrotum</seg> (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> iii. 2. 4; 1. 10; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 189" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 189</bibl>) was probably applied to a pavement made of small pieces of stone or marble of natural colours, and distinguished from those of coloured glass or some other artificial composition. Mosaics of glass were used to decorate ceilings.</p>
 <p>The gilt <seg lang="la">tesserae</seg> used in Christian mosaics for the background of the pictures were formed by applying to a cube of earthenware two thin plates of glass with a film of gold-leaf between them, and vitrifying the whole in a furnace. It was this discovery that led to the extensive application of mosaic for the decoration of the walls, and more particularly the apses, of Christian churches. After the ninth century the art of working in mosaic ceased for a while in Rome and in Italy in general, to be revived at a later date in the church of S. Cyprian at Murano <bibl default="NO">(1109)</bibl> and the basilica of St. Mark's at Venice (in and after the eleventh century), and afterwards at Rome itself. In Sicily, the mosaics of the Cappella Palatina in the Royal Palace at Palermo were finished in 1143, while those of the cathedral at Monreale were begun in 1172.</p>

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Mycēné</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Μυκῆναι, Μυκήνη</foreign>). A city at the head of the plain of Argolis, reputed in Greek tradition to have been the residence of Agamemnon. Its most flourishing period probably fell within the latter half of the second thousand years before Christ. At that time the seat of wealthy and powerful chieftains, it subsequently fell under the power of Argos, and was during the historical period a place of no importance. The wall of the citadel and several “bee-hive” tombs have always been visible. Excavations, carried on by Schliemann in 1876, and later by the Greek Archaeological Society, have enormously increased our knowledge of Mycenae and of the early civilization which it represents.</p>
 <p>The first illustration shows in the middle distance the acropolis of Mycenae, with a portion of its encompassing wall. This wall, for the most part, resembles in its construction that of <ref type="cross" target="crosstiryns">Tiryns</ref> (q.v.), though the blocks are not so gigantic. In places, however, we find an outer facing of approximately regular ashlar masonry (so, e. g., at the Lion Gate); in other places, of carefully jointed polygonal work. The principal entrance, the socalled Lion Gate, is shown in the third illustration. It consists of two upright posts surmounted by an enormous flat lintel. The relieving triangle above the lintel is filled by a relief representing 
<pb n="1068" /><cb />
 two lions (or lionesses) facing one another, and having between them an object of doubtful interpretation. There is, in addition, a smaller gate on the north side of the citadel.</p>
 <p>Within the Lion Gate is a circular enclosure, nearly ninety feet in diameter. This was formed by two concentric rows of upright slabs, the space between the two rows being covered by horizontal slabs. Within the enclosure are six rectangular graves of various sizes, sunk in the rock at various depths below the double ring of slabs. The graves when opened contained the remains of from one to five corpses each (buried unburned), or nineteen in all, together with gold masks and ornaments, vessels of gold and of bronze, bronze weapons, pottery of the so-called Mycenae type, etc. Above the graves (in precisely what positions it is now difficult to make out) stood a number of grave-stones, partly unsculptured, partly sculptured with rude reliefs.</p>
 <p>At the summit of the acropolis remains of a palace, similar in plan to that of Tiryns, but less well preserved, were discovered in 1886 by the Greek Archaeological Society. The great <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> or hall, with its circular hearth surrounded by four pillars and its double vestibule, is easily recognizable. Above the palace, and partly upon its ruins, are remains of what is thought to have been an early Doric temple.</p>
 <p>Outside the acropolis was the city, consisting apparently of several detached settlements. In this region eight large subterranean buildings, doubtless tombs, of bee-hive form, are known to exist. The most imposing of these is the so-called “Treasury of Atreus” or “Tomb of Agamemnon,” of which a vertical section is shown on p. 452. It is approached by a passage-way or <foreign lang="greek">δρόμος</foreign>, walled at the sides, but open above. Then comes the doorway, once closed by heavy doors. The principal inner chamber is about fifty feet in diameter at <figure id="fig.01068">

It is built of great stones, laid in horizontal courses, each course pushed a little farther inward than the one below; compare the construction of the relieving triangle over the Lion Gate. There is, besides, a smaller side-chamber, cut in the rock. The other seven beehive tombs are built in a similar fashion, but with smaller stones. In addition to these, upwards of sixty smaller tomb-chambers, excavated in the solid rock and approached likewise by <foreign lang="greek">δρόμοι</foreign>, have been discovered and opened.</p>
 <p>The prehistoric civilization to which the Mycenaean remains bear witness must have been, in comparison with what meets us at the dawn of the historical period in Greece, a brilliant one. That <cb /> <figure id="fig.01068.2">

A district of Asia Minor, called also the Asiatic Mysia (<foreign lang="greek">Μυσία ἡ Ἀσιανή</foreign>), in contradistinction to Moesia on the banks of the Danube.

It was subdivided into five parts: (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mysia Minor</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ μικρά</foreign>), along the northern coast;</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mysia Maior</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ μεγάλη</foreign>), the southeastern inland region, with a small portion of the coast between the Troad and the Aeolic settlements about the Elaïtic Gulf;</p>

 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossteuthrania">Teuthrania</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Τευθρανία</foreign>), the southwestern angle, between Temnus and the borders of Lydia, where, in very early times, Teuthras was said to have established a Mysian kingdom, which was early subdued by the kings of Lydia; this part was also called Pergamené, from the celebrated 
<pb n="1071" /><cb /> city of Pergamus, which stood in it. This account applies to the time of the early Roman Empire; the extent of Mysia and its subdivisions varied greatly at other times.</p>
 <p>In the Heroic Age we find the great Teucrian monarchy of Troy in the northwest of the country and the Phrygians along the Hellespont; as to the Mysians, who appear as allies of the Trojans, it is not clear whether they were Europeans or Asiatics. The Mysia of the legends respecting Telephus is the Teuthranian kingdom in the south, only with a wider extent than the later Teuthrania. Under the Persian Empire, the northwestern portion, which was still occupied in part by Phrygians, but chiefly by Aeolian settlements, was called Phrygia Minor, and by the Greeks Hellespontus. Mysia was the region south of the chain of Ida; and both formed, with Lydia, the second satrapy. In the division of the Empire of Alexander the Great, Mysia fell, with Thrace, to the share of Lysimachus, B.C. 311, after whose defeat and death, in 281, it became a part of the Graeco-Syrian kingdom, with the exception of the southwestern portion, where Philetaerus founded the kingdom of Pergamus (280), to which kingdom the whole of Mysia was assigned, together with Lydia, Phrygia, Caria, Lycia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia, after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by the Romans in 190. With the rest of the kingdom of Pergamus, Mysia fell to the Romans in 133 by the bequest of Attalus III., and formed part of the province of Asia. Under the later Empire, Mysia formed a separate proconsular province under the name of Hellespontus.</p>
 <p>The country was, for the most part, mountainous, its chief chains being those of Ida, Olympus, and Temnus, which are terminal branches of the northwestern part of the Taurus chain, and the union of which forms the elevated land of southeastern Mysia. Their prolongations into the sea form several important bays and capes—namely, among the former, the great Gulf of Adramyttium (Adramytti), which cuts off Lesbos from the continent, and the Sinus Elaïticus (Gulf of Chandeli); and, among the latter, Sigeum (Cape Yenicheri) and Lectum (Gulf of Baba), at the northwestern and southwestern extremities of the Troad, and Cane (Cape Coloni) and Hydria (Fokia), the northern and southern headlands of the Elaïtic Gulf. Its rivers are numerous; some of them considerable, in proportion to the size of the country; and some of first-rate importance in history and poetry; the chief of them, beginning on the east, were Rhyndacus and Macestus, Tarsius, Aesepus, Granicus, Rhodius, Simoïs and Scamander, Satnoïs, Evenus, and Caïcus. The peoples of the country, besides the general appellations mentioned above, were known by the following distinctive names: the Olympieni or Olympeni (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιηνοί, Ὀλυμπηνοί</foreign>), in the district of Olympené at the foot of Mount Olympus; next to them, on the south and west, and occupying the greater part of Mysia proper, the Abretteni, who had a native divinity called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Ἀβρεττηνός</foreign>; the Trimenthuritae, the Pentademitae, and the Mysomacedones, all in the region of Mount Temnus.

The term <foreign lang="greek">τελεταί</foreign> is likewise employed, and the Latin equivalent is <hi rend="SmallCaps">Initia</hi> ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 14, 36). The Mysteries were ceremonies in the ancient religions practised in seclusion and known only to bodies of initiates. They were held at certain fixed seasons and were largely symbolical in their character, though their origin is not very satisfactorily understood. It is held by many that they were intended to strengthen men's hopes in a future life in which the good who fail of a reward here should there receive it, while punishment should be visited upon the wicked. Hence a part of the ceremonial had to do with the resurrection of the gods and heroes; and we find some remarkable passages in the Greek poets that support this view. Thus Pindar (<title>Frag.</title> 137): “Blessed is he who has seen them before he goes below the earth;” and the inscription (<bibl default="NO"><title>Ephem.

 <p>The Mysteries consisted of purifications, sacrifices, processions, songs, dances, dramatic spectacles, and similar ceremonies. The formulae or liturgies (<foreign lang="greek">δεικνύμενα, λεγόμενα, δρώμενα</foreign>) were kept profoundly secret, to be revealed only to those who had been fully initiated. The <seg lang="la">mystagogi</seg>, or priests of the Mysteries, had undoubtedly at their command an abundance of mechanical devices to produce effects most startling and convincing to the credulous worshippers. All the arts, in fact, were taxed to the utmost to astonish, dazzle, and appal. Marvels of light, sound, and colour were displayed. Mysterious harmonies stole upon the ears of the attendant throngs; sighs and whispers were audible amid the intervals of awful silence; lights gleamed in strangely beautiful colours; and dazzling figures appeared and disappeared. In the earlier times the fame of the Mysteries was very great. Herodotus speaks of some 30,000 persons attending them (viii. 65); but in later times they degenerated, the secrecy was removed, and they became orgies in the modern sense of the word, at which the most shameless indecencies were practised, until under the Romans they had to be suppressed as public nuisances.</p>
 <p>The most important Mysteries were those of Eleusis and the Thesmophoria, both symbolizing the rape of Persephoné and the search for her by her mother Demeter (see <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossthesmophoria">Thesmophoria</ref>); those of Cybelé and Aphrodité, referring to the mystery of procreation (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaphrodisia">Aphrodisia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossrhea">Rhea</ref>); those of Orpheus, who was regarded as the founder of all Mysteries (see <ref type="cross" target="crossorphica">Orphica</ref>); of Bacchus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>); of Zeus in Crete; of the foreign gods Mithras (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmithras">Mithras</ref>), Sabazius (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssabazius">Sabazius</ref>), the Cabeiri (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscabeiria">Cabeiria</ref>), and Isis (see <ref type="cross" target="crossisis">Isis</ref>). The most famous Mysteries of Roman origin were those of the Bona Dea (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbona-dea">Bona Dea</ref>) and of the Arval Brethren (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>).</p>

<head orig="Mythologia">Mythologia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μυθολογία</foreign>, Plato, <title>De Rep.</title> 394 B). Mythology; a term sometimes used of the collected myths of a race or nation, and sometimes of the scientific study of such myths. A myth (<foreign lang="greek">μῦθος</foreign>) is a story, more or less poetic, related of gods or heroes. It is not a pure product of the imagination, but is best regarded as in a way related to fact, whether the fact be a preceding reality or some often-recurring phase of nature. The Greeks, a people most prolific in the development and elaboration of myths, themselves took the view that there is necessarily some meaning in a myth, either an historical occurrence disguised and exaggerated or an operation of nature veiled in an allegory. Thus Anaxagoras regarded the true meaning of most of the myths to be psychological; Empedocles, philosophical. <ref type="cross" target="crosseuhemerus">Euhemerus</ref> (q.v.) gave a rationalistic turn to mythology, stripping away the element of the supernatural altogether; though Gruppe takes the ground that the work of Euhemerus is best regarded as a work of pure fiction, with no ulterior motive behind it. The Stoics at Rome tried to explain all myths as allegorical descriptions of physical facts, but this failed to account for just those myths which most required explanation—the hideously immoral and bestial myths that troubled the minds of men like Plato.</p>
 <p>It is safe to say that most myths are the result of man's observations of nature, whose various forms are personified as powerful beings by the imaginations of primitive men. These forms were regarded as in part hostile and in part friendly to man. A more advanced stage of mental development elaborated these crude conceptions, and began to regard these beings as acting in accordance with fixed moral laws and endowed with human forms. Thus we have Anthropomorphism. Poets and story-tellers brought the gods into connection with one another by inventing genealogies for them and building up a whole political system, presided over by Zeus, the father alike of gods and men. Around the earlier and ruder fancies a wonderful maze was now woven, adorned by all the arts of poetry and prose and embedded in the nation's literature. Among the Romans the cruder and simpler notion prevailed much longer—in fact, throughout the whole period of purely national development. To them the gods were still only the natural forces—beings strangely impersonal and making little demand upon the imagination or the affection. They were to be propitiated, but not loved. Their worship was a State affair, and the early Roman performed his religious duties in <cb /> much the same spirit as he paid his taxes. This is shown in the very nature of the deities at Rome —gods not only of the sky and the earth, the sea and the world below, but gods of thievery and lust, of typhoid fever and sewers. Later, when the Romans came into contact with the Greeks and began the systematic study of their literature, they adopted the Greek conception of the gods and the genealogies worked out by Hesiod and others. They transplanted the Greek myths and told them of such of their own gods and goddesses as bore the closest likeness to those of the Greeks, identifying Zeus with Iupiter, Heré with Iuno, Ares with Mars, Athené with Minerva, and so on. For some of their deities, as, for instance, Ianus, they could find no Hellenic prototype.</p>
 <p>In modern times the Graeco-Roman mythology has been differently viewed. Creuzer made it wholly symbolical and allegorical; Lobeck overthrew this doctrine in its extreme form and paved the way for a thoroughly scientific study of the subject. The brothers Grimm taught that mythology was not, as Creuzer implied, the work of the superior few, of a learned caste, but was the way in which the multitude expressed their religious feeling. This view is supported by the fact that in peoples widely apart the same myth is found, varying in its form, but identical in its main outlines. Hence arose the study of Comparative Mythology, the creation of two scholars—Adalbert Kuhn <bibl default="NO">(1812-81)</bibl> in Germany, and Max Müller in England. The object of this study is to trace all myths back to the pre-historic period when the Indo-European peoples were united; and, having done so, to determine the original forms and the original meanings. More recent mythologists, such as Mannhardt <bibl default="NO">(1831-89)</bibl>, view the folk-tales as the earliest stratum accessible to the comparative mythologist, rejecting the Sanskrit Vedas as a later and literary compilation. Gruppe, one of the very latest investigators, rejects the comparative method altogether, and thinks that myths have been simply borrowed by one nation from another, and not handed down from a common ancestry at all.</p>

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
