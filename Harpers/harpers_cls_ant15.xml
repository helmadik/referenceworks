<head orig="Oăsis">Oasis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄασις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Αὔασις</foreign>). The Greek form of the Egyptian word <title>Uah</title>, which was used to denote an island in the sea of sand of the great Libyan Desert. These oases are preserved from the shifting sands by steep hills of limestone round them, and watered by springs, which make them fertile and habitable. The name is applied especially to two of these oases on the west of Egypt, which were taken possession of by the Egyptians at an early period. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Oăsis Maior</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄασις μεγάλη</foreign>), the Greater Oasis, was situated seven days' journey west of Abydos, and belonged to Upper Egypt. This oasis contains numerous ruins of the ancient Egyptian and Roman periods.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Oasis Minor</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄασις μικρά</foreign>), the Lesser or Second Oasis, was a good day's journey from the southwestern end of Lake Moeris, and belonged to the Heptanomis, or Middle Egypt. <cb /></p>
 <p>(3) A still more celebrated oasis than either of these was that called <ref type="cross" target="crossammon">Ammon</ref>, Hammon, Ammonium, Hammōnis Oracŭlum, from its being a chief seat of the worship and oracle of the god Ammon. It is now called Siwah. Its distance from Cairo is twelve days, and from the northern coast about 160 English miles. The Ammonians do not appear to have been subject to the old Egyptian monarchy. Cambyses, after conquering Egypt in B.C. 525, sent an army against them, which was overwhelmed by the sands of the desert. In B.C. 331, Alexander the Great visited the oracle, which hailed him as the son of Zeus Ammon (Q. Curt. iv. 33). Cato the Younger also made a journey to the place. Ruins of the temple of Ammon still exist.

<div2 id="crossobeliscus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Obeliscus">Obeliscus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀβελίσκος</foreign>). Literally, a small spit, diminutive of <foreign lang="greek">ὀβελός</foreign>; whence applied to other things which possess a sharp or pointed extremity, like a spit; and especially to the tall, slender, rectangular columns, upon a narrow base, and terminating in a point at the top, which were originally invented by the Egyptians, and retain their ancient name with us (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 13</bibl>; <bibl n="Ammian.  17. 4" default="NO">Ammian.xvii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Ammian.  6" default="NO">Ammian., 6</bibl>). The obelisk served in Egyptian art the same purpose as the <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign> of the Greeks and the <seg lang="la">columna</seg> of the Romans, marking the triumphs or the honours of some prince. They are monoliths, cut in four faces, and are broader at the base than at the top, near which the sides form the base of a pyramid in which the obelisk terminates. The sides are very slightly concave, in order to increase the impression of height, which varies from 25 1/2 inches to a hundred feet. Upon them are usually cut inscriptions in hieroglyphics and pictures recording the names and titles of kings. They were 
<pb n="1118" /><cb /> transported in rafts from their quarries at the time of the inundation of the Nile, and raised by means of inclined planes aided by machinery. Some of the obelisks give evidences of having originally had their tips covered with gilded bronze or gold. The use of obelisks antedates history, and has continued to modern times. Most of the Egyptian obelisks date from the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties <bibl default="NO">(B.C. 1800-1300)</bibl>. The most famous two once stood at Heliopolis, whence they were brought by Rameses II. to Alexandria. These are the ones <figure id="fig.01118">
<head orig="Ancient Obelisk.">Ancient Obelisk.</head>
</figure> popularly known as “Cleopatra 's Needles,” of which one was taken to London in 1878 and set up on the Thames Embankment, and the other to New York in 1881, where it is now one of the ornaments of Central Park. There are several at Rome—in the Piazza della Trinità, the Piazza di Monte Citorio, the Piazza del Quirinale, the Piazza dell' Esquilino, the Piazza della Minerva, the Circo Agonale (Piazza Navona), the Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano, the Piazza del Popolo, and the Piazza di San Pietro, and others of no historical importance. <cb /> The last named was brought from Heliopolis by Caligula, and is the only one at Rome that has never been broken. Its height is 132 feet. There are also ancient obelisks at Florence, Constantinople, Arles, Catana, and Paris, and one (Lepsius's) at Berlin, this being at once the oldest and the smallest of all, having a height of only 2 feet 1 1/2 inches. Of these small obelisks other specimens are to be seen in various European museums. No ancient obelisk ever attained the height of the modern American obelisk at Washington, though this, of course, is not a monolith.

<div2 id="crossobligatio-litterarum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Obligatio Litterārum">Obligatio Litterarum</head>

 <p> One of the four modes of incurring contractive obligations was “by letters” (<seg lang="la">litteris</seg>, <bibl n="Gaius  3. 137" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, iii. 137</bibl>). The contract was made by the creditor's entry in his account-book (<seg lang="la">codex accepti et expensi</seg>) under the head of <seg lang="la">expensum</seg> to the debtor. To this entry the debtor's assent was necessary (Val. Max. viii. 2, 2), but he need not actually have received the money. The items of receipt and expenditure appear to have been entered without distinction, in the order of their occurrence, in a day-book (<seg lang="la">adversaria</seg>), and transcribed at the end of each month into a ledger (<seg lang="la">tabulae, codex accepti et expensi</seg>), the precise form and character of which is much disputed, though most probably it was arranged in two sides or columns after the fashion of an ordinary banker's pass-book. The entry in this ledger (<seg lang="la">nomen facere</seg>) made the contract, and bound the debtor to repay the specified sum: it was not merely evidence, admitting of the possibility of rebuttal. We are told by Gaius (iii. 131) that if an entry were made in the codex of an actual money loan, the obligation to repay it arose <seg lang="la">re</seg>, not <seg lang="la">litteris</seg>, and the debt was called specifically <seg lang="la">nomen arcarium</seg>, the written record serving merely as evidence. It follows that wherever a genuine money debt was created <seg lang="la">litteris</seg> it must have been under the fiction of a loan, as appears to have been the case in two instances of debts originally incurred in this manner of which we have a record ( <title>Ad Att.</title> iv. 18; Val. Max. viii. 2, 2).

<div2 id="crossoceanus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Oceănus">Oceanus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὠκεανός</foreign>). (1) The god of the stream Oceanus, earlier than Poseidon. He was the firstborn of the Titans, the offspring of Uranus and Gaea, or Heaven and Earth. Oceanus espoused his sister Tethys, and their children were the rivers of the earth and the three thousand Oceanides or Nymphs of Ocean (Hesiod, <title>Theog.</title> 337 foll.). <cb /> This is all the account of Oceanus that is given in the <title>Theogony.</title> Homer speaks of him and Tethys as the father even of the gods ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14. 201" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xiv. 201</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 246" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 246</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 302" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 302</bibl>). When Zeus placed his sire in Tartarus, Rhea committed her daughter Heré to the charge of Oceanus and Tethys, by whom she was carefully nurtured. The abode of Oceanus was in the West ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14. 200" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xiv. 200</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 301" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 301</bibl>). He dwelt, according to Aeschylus, in a grotto place, beneath his stream, as it would appear (<title>Prom. Vinct.</title> 300). In the <title>Prometheus Vinctus</title> of this poet, Oceanus comes borne through the air on a hippogriff, to console and advise the heroic sufferer; and from the account given of his journey, it is manifest that he came from the West. When Heracles was crossing his stream in the cup of the Sun-god to procure the oxen of Geryon, Oceanus rose, and, by agitating his waters, tried to terrify him; but, on the hero's bending a bow at him, he retired.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Besides being the name of a deity, the term Oceanus (<foreign lang="greek">Ὠκεανός</foreign>) occurs in Homer in another sense also. It is made to signify an immense stream, which, according to the rude ideas of that early age, circulated around the terraqueous plain, and from which the different seas ran out in the manner of bays. This opinion, which is also that of Eratosthenes, was prevalent even in the time of Herodotus (iv. 36). Homer terms the ocean <foreign lang="greek">ἀψόρροος</foreign>, because it thus flowed back into itself. This same river Oceanus was supposed to ebb and flow thrice in the course of a single day, and the heavenly bodies were believed to descend into it at their setting and emerge from it at their rising. Hence the term <foreign lang="greek">ὠκεανός</foreign> is sometimes put for the horizon. In Homer, therefore, <foreign lang="greek">ὠκεανός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θάλασσα</foreign> always mean different things, the latter merely denoting the sea in the more modern acceptation of the term. On the shield of Achilles the poet represents Oceanus as encircling the rim or extreme border of the shield, in full accordance with the popular belief of the day, whereas in Vergil's time, when this primitive meaning of the term was obsolete, and more correct geographical views had come in, we find the sea (the idea being borrowed, probably, from the position of the Mediterranean) occupying in the poet's description the <seg lang="la">centre</seg> of the shield of Aeneas. Herodotus (ii. 23; iv. 8) rejects the notion that Oceanus is a stream. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgeographia">Geographia</ref>.</p>
 <p>It is remarkable that one of the oldest names of the Nile among the Greeks was <foreign lang="greek">ὠκεανός</foreign>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀχλοκρατία</foreign>). The dominion of the rabble, or “mobocracy.” It is a name of later origin than the time of Aristotle, and applied to that perversion of a democracy which extends the idea far beyond that of a State where all have equal legal rights and equal franchise, so that the natural and wholesome inequalities of society were removed or counteracted by the introduction of devices, such as paying citizens for attendance in the popular assembly, or increasing the number and restricting the duration and authority of public offices. Hence the exercise of all the highest functions of government came to be practically in the hands of a mere faction, consisting of the lowest and poorest, though most numerous, class of citizens, who were thus tempted to adopt as their vocation that which they would formerly have delegated to others; and the State came to be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">property</hi> of which each citizen was entitled to an equal share. In some respects, therefore, it most nearly represents the modern idea of a socialistic State (Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 4. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>iv. 5</bibl>).

He himself was a cowardly and reckless despot; and the great advantages which the Persian arms gained during his reign were owing only to his Greek generals and mercenaries. These advantages consisted in the conquest of the revolted satrap Artabazus and in the reduction of Phoenicia, of several revolted towns in Cyprus, and of Egypt, B.C. 350. The reins of government were entirely in the hands of the eunuch Bagoas and of Mentor the Rhodian. At last he was poisoned by Bagoas, and was succeeded by his youngest son, Arses.

<head orig="Octavia">Octavia</head>

 <p> (1) A daughter of Gaius Octavius and Accia, and sister to the emperor Augustus. All the historians praise the beauty and virtues of this celebrated woman. She was first married to Marcus Marcellus, a man of consular rank, and every way worthy of her; and after his death she became the wife of M. Antonius, this latter union being deemed essential to the public welfare, as a means of healing existing differences between Antonius and Octavianus. It was with this view that the Senate abridged the period of her widowhood and of her mourning for her first husband, who had been dead little more than five months. Antonius, however, was incapable of appreciating the excellence of her character. After her marriage she followed him to Athens, where she passed the winter with him (B.C. 39), though keeping far aloof from the dissolute pleasures to which he abandoned himself. Without her interposition, civil war would even then have broken out between Octavianus and Antonius. By urgent prayers she appeased her husband, who was incensed against her brother for his suspicions, and then, disregarding the difficulties of the journey and her own pregnancy, she went with his consent from Greece to Rome, and induced her brother to consent to an interview with Antonius, and to come to a reconciliation with him. When Antonius went to make

 war against the Parthians, she accompanied him to Corcyra, and at his order returned thence to remain with her brother. New quarrels arose between Octavianus and Antonius. To have a pretext for a rupture, the former ordered his sister to go to her husband, in the expectation that he would send her back. This actually happened. Antonius was leading a life of pleasure with Cleopatra at Leucopolis, when letters from Octavia at Athens informed him that she would soon join him with money and troops. The prospect of this visit was so unwelcome to Cleopatra that she persisted in her entreaties until Antonius sent his wife an order to return. Even now, however, she endeavoured to pacify the rivals. Octavianus commanded her to leave the house of a husband who had treated her so insultingly; but, feeling her duties as a wife and a Roman, she begged him not, for the sake of a single woman, to destroy the peace of the world, and of two persons so dear to her, by the horrors of war. Octavianus granted her wish; she remained in the house of Antonius, and occupied herself with educating, with equal care and tenderness, the children she had borne him and those of his first wife Fulvia. This noble behaviour of hers increased the indignation of the Romans against Antonius. At last, when war broke out between Antonius and Octavianus, he divorced her, and ordered her to leave his mansion at Rome. She obeyed without complaint, and after his death reared the children he had had by Fulvia and Cleopatra. She died in B.C. 11. Her children numbered five—three by Marcellus and two by Antonius, the last being daughters. Her son, M. Marcellus, was adopted by Augustus, and was intended by him for his successor; but he died in B.C. 23. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcellus">Marcellus</ref>.) Her elder daughter by Antonius was the grandmother of the emperor Nero, and the younger was the mother of the emperor Claudius and grandmothor of Caligula.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The daughter of the emperor Claudius, born A.D. 42. She was first betrothed by Claudius to L. Silanus, who put an end to his life, as Agrippina had destined Octavia to be the wife of her son, afterwards the emperor Nero. She was married to Nero in A.D. 53, but was soon deserted by her young and profligate husband for Poppaea Sabina. After living with the latter as his mistress for some time, he resolved to recognize her as his legal wife; and accordingly he divorced Octavia on the alleged ground of sterility, and then married Poppaea, A.D. 62. Shortly afterwards Octavia was falsely accused of adultery, and was banished to the little island of Pandataria, where she was put to death. Her untimely end excited general commiseration. Octavia is the heroine of a tragedy, found among the works of Seneca, but the <cb /> author of which was more probably Curiatius Maternus.

In B.C. 165 he was consul with M. Torquatus. Having been sent, three years after this, into Syria, at the head of a deputation to act as guardians to the young king, Antiochus Eupator, he was assassinated by order, as was supposed, of Lysias, a relative of the previous monarch, who claimed the regency during the minority of Antiochus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀδυσσεύς</foreign>; the Latin equivalent being <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ulixes;</hi> erroneously written <ref type="cross" target="crossulysses">Ulysses</ref>). King of Ithaca, son of Laertes and Anticlea, the daughter of Autolycus. In post-Homeric legends he is called a son of Sisyphus, conceived by Anticlea before her marriage with Laertes. According to Homer, his name (“the hater,” from <foreign lang="greek">ὀδύσσομαι</foreign>) was given him by his grandfather Autolycus, because he himself had so often cherished feelings of hatred during his life ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 19. 402" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xix. 402</bibl>). His wife Penelopé (or <cb /> Penelopea), daughter of Icarius (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspenelope">Penelopé</ref>), is said by later legends to have been obtained for him by her uncle Tyndareos in gratitude for counsel given by him. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstyndareus">Tyndareos</ref>.) When his son Telemachus was still an infant, Agamemnon and Menelaüs, as Homer tells us, prevailed on him to take part in the expedition against Troy. Their task was hard, as it had been predicted to him that it would be twenty years before he saw his wife and child again. Later writers relate that he was bound, as one of Helen's suitors, to take part in the scheme, but tried to escape his obligation by feigning madness, and among other acts yoked a horse and an ox to his plough and so ploughed a field. When, however, Palamedes, who, with Nestor and Menelaüs, was desirous of taking him to Troy, proceeded to place Telemachus in the furrow, he betrayed himself, and had to accompany them to the war. Odysseus led the troops of Ithaca and the surrounding islands to Troy in twelve vessels. In contrast to the later legend, which represents him as a cowardly, deceitful, and intriguing personage, he always appears in Homer among the noblest and most respected of the heroes, and, on account of his good qualities, he is the declared favourite of Athené. He combines in his person courage and determined perseverance with prudence, ingenuity, cunning, and eloquence. Accordingly, he is employed by preference as a negotiator and a spy. Thus, after the disembarkation, he goes with Menelaüs into the enemy's city to demand the surrender of Helen. Again, he is among those who are despatched by the Greeks to reconcile with Agamemnon the enraged Achilles. With Diomedes, who delights in his company, he captures the spy Dolon and surprises Rhesus; with the same hero he is said by later legend to have stolen the Palladium from Troy. When Agamemnon faint-heartedly thinks of flight, he opposes this idea with the utmost decision. Everywhere he avails himself of the right time and the right place, and, where courage and cunning are needed, is ever the foremost. After Achilles' death, in the contest with Aiax, the son of Telamon, he received the hero's arms as a recognition of his services, and by his ingenuity brought about the fall of Troy. Shortly before it, he stole into the city in the garb of a beggar, in order to reconnoitre everything there; he then climbed with the others into the wooden horse, and contrived to control the impatient and the timid alike until the decisive moment. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.</p>
 <p>His adventures during the return from Troy and on his arrival in his native country form the contents of the <title>Odyssey</title> of Homer. Immediately after the departure Odysseus was driven to the Thracian Ismarus, the city of the Cicones, and, though he plundered it, he lost in a surprise seventy-two of his companions. When he was desirous of rounding the promontory of Malea, the southeast point of the Peloponnesus, he was caught by the storm and carried in nine days to the coast of North Africa, on to the land of the Lotophagi (lotus-eaters), whence he had to drag his companions by force to prevent their forgetting their homes for love of the lotus-food. Thence the voyage passed into the legendary world of the Western Sea, then little known to the Greeks. Odysseus came first to the country of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclopes">Cyclopes</ref> (q.v.), where, with twelve of his comrades, he was

 shut up in a cavern by Polyphemus. The monster had already devoured half of Odysseus's companions before the latter intoxicated him, deprived him of his one eye, and by his cunning escaped with his comrades. From this time the anger of Poseidon, on whom Polyphemus called for revenge, pursued him and kept him far from his country. On the island of Aeolus, the Keeper of the <ref type="cross" target="crosswinds">Winds</ref> (q.v.), he found hospitable entertainment, and received on his departure a leathern bag, in which were enclosed all the winds except the western. The latter would have carried him in nine days to the coast of Ithaca; but, while Odyssens was resting, his comrades opened the bag, which they imagined to contain treasure, and the winds thus released carried them back to Aeolus. He ordered them off from his island, regarding them as enemies of the gods. On coming to Telepylus, the city of Lamus, King Antiphates and his Laestrygones, cannibals of immense stature, shattered eleven of their vessels, and the twelfth was saved only by Odysseus's wariness. On the island of Aeaea the sorceress Circé turned part of his crew into swine, but with the help of Hermes, who gave him an antidote against her charms, he compelled her to restore them to their human shape, and spent a whole year with her in pleasure and enjoyment. When his companions urged him to return home, Circé bade him first sail towards the farthest west, to the entrance into the lower world on the farther bank of Oceanus, and there question the shade of the seer Tiresias concerning his return. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshades">Hades</ref>.) From the latter he learned that it was the malice of Poseidon that prevented his return, but that nevertheless he would attain his object if his comrades spared the cattle of Helios on the island of Thrinacia; otherwise, it would be only after a long time, deprived <cb /> of all his comrades and on a foreign ship, that he would reach his home. Odysseus next returned to the isle of Circé and set out on his homeward voyage, supplied by her with valuable directions and a favouring wind. Passing the isles of the Sirens, who tried to lure his vessel upon the rocks by their sweet songs, but whom Odysseus resisted by filling his sailors' ears with wax and lashing himself to the mast, and sailing through Scylla and <ref type="cross" target="crosscharybdis">Charybdis</ref> (q.v.), he reached the island of Thrinacia, where he was compelled to land by his comrades. They were there detained for a month by contrary winds; at length his comrades, overcome by hunger, in spite of the oath they had sworn to him, slaughtered, during his absence, the finest of the cattle of Helios. Scarcely were they once more at sea, when a terrible storm broke forth, and Zeus split the ship in twain with a flash of lightning, as a penalty for the offence. All perished except Odysseus, who clung to the mast and keel, and was carried back by the waves to Scylla and Charybdis, and after nine days reached the island of Ogygia, the abode of the nymph Calypso, daughter of Atlas. For seven years he dwelt here with the nymph, who promised him immortality and eternal youth, if he would consent to remain with her and be her husband. But the yearning for his wife and home made him proof against her snares. All the day long he sat on the shore gazing through his tears across the broad sea; anxious to catch a glimpse, were it only of the rising smoke of his home, and thereafter die. So his protectress, Athené, during Poseidon's absence, prevailed on Zeus, in an assembly of the gods, to decree his return, and to send Hermes to order Calypso to release him. Borne on a raft of his own building, he came in eighteen days near to Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians, when Poseidon caught sight of him and shattered his raft in pieces. However, with the aid of the veil of Ino <ref type="cross" target="crossleucothea">Leucothea</ref> (q.v.), he reached land in safety, and met with Nausicaa, the king's daughter, who conducted him into the Phaeacian city before her parents <ref type="cross" target="crossalcinous">Alcinoüs</ref> (q.v.) and Areté. He received the most hospitable treatment, and was then brought by the Phaeacians loaded with presents on board one of their marvellous vessels to his own country, which he reached after twenty years' absence, while asleep. He arrived just in time to ward off <figure id="fig.01123.2">

<pb n="1124" /><cb /> the disaster that was threatening his house. After his mother Anticlea had died of grief for her son, and old Laertes had retired to his country estate in mourning, more than a hundred noble youths of Ithaca and the surrounding isles had appeared as suitors for the hand of the fair and chaste Penelopé, had persecuted Telemachus, who was now growing up to manhood, and were wasting the substance of the absent Odysseus. Penelopé had demanded a respite from making her decision until she had finished weaving a shroud intended for her father-in-law, and every night unravelled the work of the day. In the fourth year one of her attendants betrayed the secret; she had to complete the garment, and when urged to make her decision promised to choose the man who should win in a shooting-match with Odysseus's bow, hoping that none of the wooers would be able even so much as to bend it. Just before the day of trial, Odysseus landed on the island disguised by Athené as a beggar. He betook him<figure id="fig.01124">
<head orig="Odysseus and Penelopé. (Pompeian Painting.)">Odysseus and Penelope. (Pompeian Painting.)</head>
</figure> self to the honest swineherd Eumaeus, one of the few retainers who had remained true to him, who received his master, whom he failed to recognize, in an hospitable manner. To the same spot Athené brought Telemachus, who had returned in safety, in spite of the plots of the suitors, from a journey to Nestor at Pylus, and to Menelaüs and Helen in Sparta. Hereupon Odysseus made himself known, and, together with his son and retainer, concerted his plan of revenge. In the shape of a beggar he betook himself to the house, where he manfully controlled his anger at the arrogance of the suitors which was displayed towards himself, and his emotion on meeting Penelopé. Next day the shooting-match took place. This involved shooting through the handles of twelve axes with the bow of <ref type="cross" target="crosseurytus">Eurytus</ref> (q.v.), which the latter's son Iphitus had once presented to the young Odysseus. None of the suitors could bend the bow, and so Odysseus took hold of it, and bent it in an instant, thus achieving the master-shot. Supported <cb /> by Telemachus, Eumaeus, and the herdsman Philoetius, and with the aiding presence of Athené, he shot first the insolent Antinoüs, and then the other suitors. He next made himself known to Penelopé, who had meanwhile fallen into a deep sleep, and visited his aged father. In the meantime the relatives of the murdered suitors had taken up arms, but Athené, in the form of <ref type="cross" target="crossmentor">Mentor</ref> (q.v.), brought about a reconciliation. The only hint of Odysseus's end in Homer is in the prophecy of Tiresias—that in a calm old age a peaceful death will come upon him from the sea.</p>
 <p>In later poetry Telegonus, the son of Odysseus by Circé, is sent forth by his mother to seek out his father. He lands at Ithaca, and plunders the island. Odysseus proceeds to meet him, is wounded by him with a poisonous sting-ray, given by Circé to her son as a spear-point, and dies a painful death, which thus comes “from the sea.” On Telegonus discovering that he had killed his father, he carried the dead body home with him, together with Penelopé and Telemachus, and there the latter lived a life of immortality, Telemachus becoming husband of Circé, and Telegonus of Penelopé. Besides Telegonus, the legend told of two sons of Odysseus by Circé, named Agrius and Latinus, who were said to have reigned over the Etruscans. Telegonus, in particular, was regarded by the Romans as the founder of Tusculum (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, iii. 92) and Praenesté ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 3. 29" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>iii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 8" default="NO">Homer Od., 8</bibl>). In later times the adventures of Odysseus were transferred, as a whole, to the coast of Italy: the promontory of Circeii was regarded as the abode of Circé, and Formiae as the city of the Laestrygones. Near Surrentum was found the island of the Sirens; near Cape Lacinium that of Calypso, while near to Sicily were the isle of Aeolus, Scylla, and Charybdis, and, on the Sicilian shore, the Cyclopes. Odysseus is generally represented as a bearded man, wearing a semi-oval cap like that of a Greek sailor, as in the first illustration. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>.

<div2 id="crossoedipus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Oedĭpus">Oedipus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Οἰδίπους</foreign>). The son of Laïus, king of Thebes, and of Iocasta (called in the <title>Odyssey</title> Epicasté), the daughter of Menoeceus. An oracle had warned Laïus against having children, declaring that he would meet his death by means of his offspring; and the monarch accordingly practised continence until, after some lapse of time, having indulged in festivity, he forgot the injunction of the god, and Iocasta gave birth to a son. The father immediately delivered the child to his herdsman to expose on Mount Cithaeron. The herdsman, moved to compassion, according to one account (<bibl n="Soph. OT 1038" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Tyr.</title> 1038</bibl>), gave the babe to a neat-herd belonging to Polybus, king of Corinth; or, as others say (<bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Eurip. <title>Phoeniss.</title> 28</bibl>), the neat-herds of Polybus found the infant after it had been exposed, and brought it to Periboea, the wife of Polybus, who, being childless, reared it as her own, and named it Oedipus, on account of its swollen feet (from <foreign lang="greek">οἰδέω</foreign>, “to swell,” and <foreign lang="greek">πούς</foreign>, “a foot”); for Laïus, previous to its exposure, had pierced its ankles, and had inserted through the wound a leathern thong. The foundling Oedipus was brought up by Polybus as his heir. Happening to be reproached by some one at a banquet with being a supposititious child, he besought Periboea to inform him of the truth; but, unable to get any satisfaction from her, he went to Delphi and consulted the oracle. The god directed him to shun his native country, or else he would be the slayer of his father and the sharer of his mother's bed. He therefore resolved never to return to Corinth, where so much crime, as he thought, awaited him, and he took his road through Phocis. Now it happened that Laïus, at this same time, was on his way to Delphi, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the child which had been exposed had perished or not. He was in a chariot, accompanied by his herald Polyphontes; a few attendants came after. The father and son, total strangers to each other, met in a narrow road in Phocis. Oedipus was ordered to make way, and, on his disregarding the command, the charioteer endeavoured to crowd him out of the path. A contest thereupon ensued, and both Laïus and the charioteer, together with all the attendants except one, who fled, were slain by the hand of Oedipus.</p>
 <p>Immediately after the death of Laïus, Heré, always hostile to the city of Bacchus, sent a monster <cb /> named the Sphinx to ravage the territory of Thebes. It had the face of a woman, the breast, feet, and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. This monster had been taught riddles by the Muses, and she sat on the Phicean Hill, and propounded one to the Thebans. It was this: “What is that which has one voice, is four-footed, twofooted, and at last three-footed?” or, as others give it, “What animal is that which goes on four feet in the morning, on two at noon, and on three at evening?” The oracle told the Thebans that they would not be delivered from her until they had solved her riddle. They often met to try their skill; and when they had failed, the Sphinx always carried off and devoured one of their number. At length Haemon, son of Creon , having become her victim, the father offered by public proclamation the throne, to which he had succeeded on the death of Laïus, and the hand of his sister Iocasta, to whoever should solve the riddle of the Sphinx. Oedipus, who was then at Thebes, hearing this, came forward and answered the Sphinx that it was Man, who, when an infant, creeps on all fours; when he has attained to manhood, goes on two feet; and when old, uses a staff, a third foot. The Sphinx thereupon flung herself down to the earth and perished; and Oedipus now unknowingly accomplished the remainder of the oracle. He had by his mother two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, and two daughters, Antigoné and Ismené.</p>
 <p>After some years Thebes was afflicted with famine and pestilence; and the oracle being consulted, ordered the land to be purified of the blood which defiled it. Inquiry was set on foot after the murder of Laïus, and a variety of concurring circumstances brought the guilt home to Oedipus. Iocasta, on the discovery being made, hung herself, and her unhappy son and husband, in his grief and despair, put out his eyes. He was banished from Thebes; and, accompanied by his <figure id="fig.01125">

 <p>Such is the form in which the history of Oedipus has been transmitted to us by the Attic dramatists. We will now consider its most ancient shape. The hero of the <title>Odyssey</title> says: “I saw (in Erebus) the mother of Oedipodes, the fair Epicasta, who, in her ignorance, did an awful deed, marrying her own son; and he married, having slain his own father, and immediately the gods made this known unto men. Now he ruled over the Cadmaeans in desirable Thebes, suffering woes through the pernicious councils of the gods; but she, oppressed with grief, went to the abode of Aïdes, the strong gate-keeper, having fastened a long halter to the lofty roof, and left to him many woes, such as the avenging furies of a mother produce” ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 11. 271" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xi. 271</bibl> foll.). In the <title>Iliad</title> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.679" default="NO" valid="yes">xxiii. 679</bibl>) the funeral games are mentioned which were celebrated at Thebes in honour of the “fallen Oedipodes.” Hesiod (<bibl n="Hes. WD 162" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Op. et D.</title> 162</bibl>) speaks of the heroes who fell fighting at the seven-gated Thebes, on account of the sheep of Oedipodes. It would also seem that, according to the above passage of the <title>Odyssey</title> and to the epic poem, the <title>Oedipodea</title> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.5.11" default="NO" valid="yes">Pausan. ix. 5, 11</bibl>), Epicasta had not any children by her son; Eurygenia, the daughter of Hyperphas, being the mother of his well-known offspring. According to the cyclic <title>Thebaïs</title>, the fatal curse of Oedipus on his sons had the following origin: Polynices placed before his father a silver table which had belonged to Cadmus, and filled a golden cup with wine for him; but when Oedipus perceived the heir-looms of his family thus set before him, he raised his hands and prayed that his sons might never divide their inheritance peaceably, but ever be at strife. Elsewhere (ap. Schol. ad <bibl n="Soph. OC 1440" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Col.</title> 1440</bibl>) the <title>Thebaïs</title> said that his sons, having sent him the loin, instead of the shoulder, of the victim, he flung it to the ground, and prayed that they might fall by each other's hands.</p>
 <p>The story of Oedipus forms the subject of two plays of Sophocles, the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> and the <title>Oedipus Coloneus;</title> and was also taken by Aeschylus as the subject of a trilogy, of which only the third play, the <title>Seven against Thebes</title>, remains. Seneca also wrote a Latin tragedy, the <title>Oedipus</title>, following the first play of Sophocles with considerable fidelity. In French, Corneille and Voltaire, and in English, Dryden, have also treated the same theme dramatically.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Οἰνεύς</foreign>). A king of Calydon in Aetolia, son of Portheus or of Porthaon. He married Althaea, the daughter of Thestius, by whom he had, among other children, Meleager and Deïanira. After Althaea's death, he married Periboea or Melanippé, the daughter of Hipponoüs, by whom he became the father of Tydeus, though others made Tydeus his son by his own daughter Gorgé. In a sacrifice which Oeneus made to all the gods, upon reaping the rich produce of his fields, he forgot Artemis, and the goddess, to revenge this neglect, sent a wild boar to lay waste the territory of Calydon. The animal was at last killed, by Meleager and the neighbouring princes of Greece, in a celebrated chase known by the name of the chase of the Calydonian boar. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmeleager">Meleager</ref>.) After the death of Meleager, Oeneus was dethroned and imprisoned by the sons of his brother Agrius. Diomedes, having come secretly from the city of Argos, slew all the sons of Agrius but two, who escaped <cb /> to the Peloponnesus; and then, giving the throne of Calydon to Audraemon, son-in-law of Oeneus, who was himself now too old to reign, led the latter with him to Argolis. Oeneus was afterwards slain by the two sons of Agrius, who had fled into the Peloponnesus. Diomedes buried him in Argolis, on the spot where the city of Oenoë, called after Oeneus, was subsequently erected. Oeneus is said to have been the first that received the vine from Bacchus. The god taught him how to cultivate it, and the juice of the grape was called after his name (<foreign lang="greek">οἶνος</foreign>, “wine”) ( <bibl n="Apollod.  1. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.i. 8</bibl>;  <bibl n="Hyg.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Οἰνόμαος</foreign>). (1) King of Pisa in Elis, son of Ares and father of Hippodamia. An oracle had warned him that he should perish by the hands of his son-in-law; and as his horses were swifter than those of any other mortal, he declared that all who came forward as suitors for Hippodamia's hand should contend with him in a chariot-race, that whoever conquered should receive her, and that whoever was conquered should suffer death. The race-course extended from Pisa to the altar of Poseidon, on the Corinthian Isthmus. The suitor 
<pb n="1127" /><cb />
 started with Hippodamia in a chariot, and Oenomaüs then hastened with his swift horses after the lovers. He had overtaken and slain many a suitor, when Pelops, the son of Tantalus, came to Pisa. Pelops bribed Myrtilus, the charioteer of Oenomaüs, to take out the linch-pins from the wheels of his master's chariot, and Pelops received from Poseidon a golden chariot and horses of great swiftness. In the race which followed, the chariot of Oenomaüs broke down, and he fell out and was killed. Thus Pelops obtained Hippodamia and the kingdom of Pisa.</p>
 <p>There are some variations in this story, such as that Oenomaüs was himself in love with his own daughter, and for this reason slew her lovers. Myrtilus also is said to have loved Hippodamia, and as she favoured the suit of Pelops, she persuaded Myrtilus to take the linch-pins out of the wheels of her father's chariot. As Oenomaüs was breathing his last, he pronounced a curse upon Myrtilus. This curse had its desired effect, for as Pelops refused to give to Myrtilus the reward he had promised, or else because Myrtilus had attempted to dishonour Hippodamia, Pelops thrust him down from Cape Geraestus. Myrtilus, while dying, likewise pronounced a curse upon Pelops, which was the cause of all the calamities that afterwards befell his house. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspelops">Pelops</ref>.) The tomb of Oenomaüs was shown on the river Cladeus, in Elis. His house was destroyed by lightning, and only one pillar of it remained standing.</p>

<head orig="Oleum">Oleum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔλαιον</foreign>). Oil, a substance very extensively used in aucient times. Apart from its employment as an article of food and for burning in lamps, it served to anoint the body after the bath and in the <seg lang="la">palaestra.</seg> The oil most used was that obtained by means of olive-presses from the olive-tree (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλάα, ἐλαία</foreign>), which seems to have been transplanted from Syria to Greece and thence to Italy. The best olive-oil produced among the Greek States was that of Attica; here the olive-tree was considered a gift of the national goddess Athené, who, by means of it, had obtained the victory in her contest with Poseidon for the possession of the country. Here, also, the olive-tree was under the special protection of the State; no one was allowed to cut down olive-trees on his own plot of land, except for specified purposes, and then only a specified number. Moreover, many olive-trees standing on private ground were regarded as the property of the goddess of the State, and it was therefore forbidden, on pain of death, to cut them down. They were under the special control of the Areopagus, which had them inspected from time to time by certain officials, and they were farmed out by the State (Lysias, <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 9." default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>ix.</bibl>). Part of the oil thus obtained had to be sold by the farmer to the State at a fixed price; this was only used for festive purposes, especially to be distributed in prizes to the victors in the Panathenaic contests (Pindar, <bibl n="pind. n. 10. 35" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>x. 35</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In Italy the olive-tree, which spread thence to France and Spain, grew so well that the Italian oil, especially from the neighbourhood of the South Italian cities Venafrum and Tarentum, and that from the Sabine country (hence <title>baca Sabella</title>), was considered the finest in the world, and so met 
<pb n="1129" /><cb />
 with a ready sale abroad. The best kind was considered to be oil from unripe olives, especially the first from the press (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 15. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xv. 1</bibl>-34). See Blümner, <title>Technologie</title>, i. 348 foll.</p>

<div2 id="crossolympia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Olympia">Olympia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ὀλύμπια</foreign>). The Olympian Games; the chief national festival of the Greeks, celebrated in honour of Zeus at Olympia, in the Peloponnesian district Pisatis, belonging to the Eleans, at the point where the Cladeus runs into the Alpheus. The institution of this ancient festival is sometimes <cb /> referred to Pisus, the mythical founder of the city Pisa, which was afterwards destroyed by the Eleans, and before whose gates lay the sanctuary of Zeus; sometimes to Pelops, in whose honour funeral games were held at this point on the banks of the Alpheus.</p>
 <p>These were restored, it is said, by Heracles, who instituted the regular order of the festival. This opinion did not become current until the Dorian States, established after the immigration of the Heraclidae into the Peloponnesus, had been admitted to a share in the festival, which was originally frequented only by the Pisitans and their immediate neighbours. This admission dates from Lycurgus of Sparta and Iphitus of Elis, who, at the direction of the Delphic oracle, restored the festival of Zeus, now fallen into oblivion, and established the sacred Truce of God (see <ref type="cross" target="crossekecheiria">Ekecheiria</ref>), which insured a safe conduct at the time of the festival for all strangers resorting thither, even through hostile territory. In course of time the membership extended itself further, over all the Hellenic States in and out of Greece; and the festival was not only visited by private individuals, but also received sacred envoys from the several states. Through all the assaults of time it lasted on, even during the Roman rule, and was not abolished until A.D. 394, under the reign of Theodosius.</p>
 <p>From the time of the above-mentioned restoration by Iphitus and Lycurgus it was a quinquennial celebration—that is, it was held once in every four years, in midsummer (July to August), about the beginning or end of the Greek year. A regular and continuous list of the victors was kept from B.C. 776, when Coroebus won the race in the Stadium, and with this year begins the Olympiad reckoning prevalent among the historians from the time of <ref type="cross" target="crosstimaeus">Timaeus</ref> (q.v.). The duration of the festival was in course of time extended to at least five days.</p>
 <p>The place where the festival was celebrated was the Altis (see plan), a sacred precinct at the foot of the hill of Cronus (<foreign lang="greek">Κρόνος</foreign>), 403 feet high. The precinct, which was about 750 feet long by 570 feet broad, was surrounded by a wall ascribed to Heracles, having entrances at the northwest and southwest. The centre, both by position and by religious association, was formed by the great sacrificial altar of Zeus, which rose on an elliptical base 128 feet in circumference to a height of 32 feet, and was composed of the ashes of the victims mingled with the water of the Alpheus. Round it were grouped the four most important sanctuaries—the temples of Zeus, Hera (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡραῖον</foreign>), the Mother of the Gods (<foreign lang="greek">Μητρῷον</foreign>), and the holy enclosure of Pelops (<foreign lang="greek">Πελόπιον</foreign>) —besides a multitude of altars consecrated some to gods and some to heroes, and a countless host of dedicatory offerings and statues of every kind, among them, southeast of the temple of Zeus, the Niké of <ref type="cross" target="crosspaeonius">Paeonius</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>The temple of Zeus, which was begun about B.C. 572 by the Elean Libo, was not completed in its main outline until about 450. It was a Doric hypaethral building, having no roof over the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> or temple proper; and it was also peripteral—that is, it was surrounded by a single row of columns. It was built of the local conchyliferous limestone (called <foreign lang="greek">πῶρος</foreign> by Pausanias, v. 10. 2). In its more finished parts it was overlaid with fine stucco, giving the appearance of marble, and was also richly decorated with colour. It was 210 feet in

 length, 91 in breadth, and 65 in height. The outer hall had 6 columns along its breadth and 13 along its length (each 34 feet high), while the inner hall had a double row of nine columns. The eastern pediment was occupied by a representation of the contest between Pelops and Oenomaüs, with Zeus as the centre (fig. 1); the western, by one of the battle between the Centaurs and Lapithae, with Apollo as centre (fig. 2). The former was designed by the already-mentioned Paeonius; the latter, by Alcamenes of Athens.</p>
 <p>The accompanying illustrations indicate the figures belonging to the two pediments, so far as their fragmentary portions were recovered in the excavations begun by the German archaeologists in 1875. While the outer metopes beneath these pediments had no ornament except a large plain boss on each, twelve other metopes sculptured with reliefs adorned the outer walls at each end of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> or temple proper, six over the door of the <foreign lang="greek">πρόναος</foreign>, and six over that of the <foreign lang="greek">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign>. All these have been discovered—four by the French <figure id="fig.01130.2">

</figure> <cb /> in 1829, and eight by the Germans in 1875-79. Their subjects are the labours of Heracles. The best preserved of the series, and one of them which, as compared with the rest, is apparently the work of a mature and well-trained school of sculpture, is that representing Heracles bearing the heavens. Atlas stands by, offering to Heracles the apples of the Hesperides, and on the other side one of the daughters of Atlas is touching the hero's burden with her arm, as though endeavouring to aid him in sustaining it. In the chamber at the western end of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> stood the greatest work of Greek art, the statue of Zeus, wrought in gold and ivory by <ref type="cross" target="crossphidias">Phidias</ref> (q.v.). Outside the sacred enclosure, though still in direct connection with it, were, to the west, the Gymnasium, and to the east the Hippodrome and the Stadium. The Hippodrome has been washed away by the encroachments of the Alpheus. The Stadium, which was 600 Olympic feet in length, has been excavated to an extent sufficient to determine the length of the single course, between the starting-place and the goal, 
<pb n="1131" /><cb />
 to be 192.27 metres=630.81845073 English feet. The Olympic foot therefore measured .3204 of a metre=1.05120036 feet. The parallel grooves in the slabs of stone at each end of the Stadium still show the spot where the feet of the competitors in the foot-race were planted at the moment immediately preceding the start. There is room for twenty at either end, separated from one another by posts at intervals of four Olympic feet from one another.</p>
 <p>The festival consisted of two parts—(1) the presentation of offerings, chiefly, of course, to Zeus, but also to the other gods and heroes, on the part of the Eleans, the sacred embassies, and other visitors to the feast; and</p>
 <p>(2) the contests. In the first Olympiad the contest consisted of a simple match in the Stadium (race-course), which had a length of a trifle more than 210 yards. The runners ran <figure id="fig.01131">
<head orig="Metopé from the Cella of the Great Temple at Olympia. (Reber)">Metope from the Cella of the Great Temple at Olympia. (Reber)</head>
</figure> in heats of four, and then the winners in each heat competed together, the first in the final heat being proclaimed victor. About B.C. 724 the double course (<foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>) was introduced, in which the runners had to make a circuit of the goal and return to the starting-point; about 720 came the <foreign lang="greek">δόλιχος</foreign> or long race, where the distance of the Stadium had to be covered either 6, 7, 8, 12, 20, or 29 times (Schol. on <title>Electra</title>, 691); in 708, the <foreign lang="greek">πένταθλον</foreign>, or fivefold contest, consisting of leaping, running, quoit (<foreign lang="greek">δίσκος</foreign>) and spear throwing, and wrestling (the last being also practised by itself); in 688, boxing. In 680 chariot-racing on the Hippodrome was introduced, and, though this was twice as long as the Stadium, it had to be traversed from eight to twelve times in both directions (at first with four horses, after 500 with mules, and after 408 with two horses). From 648 there were races in which the horsemen, towards the end of the race, had to leap from their horses and run beside them with the bridle in their hands. With the same year began the practice of the <foreign lang="greek">παγκράτιον</foreign> (a combination of wrestling and boxing); with 520, the race in armour, with helmet, greaves, and shield, <cb /> though afterwards the shield alone was carried. Competitions between heralds and trumpeters also found a place here. Originally it was only men who took part in the contests; but after 632, boys also shared in them.</p>
 <p>The contests were open only to freemen of pure Hellenic descent, provided that no personal disgrace had in any way attached to them; but after the Romans came into closer relationship with Greece they were opened to them also, and indeed (as is well known) the Romans were not officially considered barbarians. Even to barbarians, however, and to slaves, permission was given to view them, while it was refused to all married women (Pausan. vi. 20. 9), or more probably all women whatsoever, except the priestess of Demeter, who even received a place of honour among the spectators. Those who took part in the competitions had to take a solemn oath at the altar of Zeus to the effect that they had spent at least ten months in preparation for the games, and that they would not resort to any unfair trick in the course of their contest: this oath was taken for boy competitors by an older relative. Special practice for thirty days at Elis was also usual, but probably only for those who were coming forward for the first time. The duties of heralds and judges were discharged by the Hellanodicae (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλανοδίκαι</foreign>), appointed by popular election from among the Eleans themselves. Their number rose in course of time from 1 to 2, 9, 10, and 12, but after 348 it was always 10. Distinguished by purple robes, wreaths of bay-leaves, and a seat of honour opposite the Stadium, they kept guard over the strict observance of all the minute regulations for the contests, and in general maintained order. In these duties they were supported by a number of attendants provided with staves. Transgressions of the laws of the games, and unfairness on the part of competitors, were punished by forfeiture of the prize or by fines of money, which went to the revenue of the temple. Out of the money from penalties of this kind, a whole row of bronze images of Zeus (called <foreign lang="greek">Ζανές</foreign>) was erected in front of the eleven treasure-houses along the eastern end of the northern wall of the Altis.</p>
 <p>The games were opened with the sound of trumpets and the proclamation of heralds, the marshalling of the various competitors in the Stadium, accompanied by the announcement of their name and country by the herald, and the appointment by lot of the pairs of combatants. The victors in the several pairs of competitors had then apparently to contend in couples with each other until one couple alone remained, and the winner in this was declared victor. If the number of combatants had been uneven, so that one of them <figure id="fig.01131.2">

<pb n="1132" /><cb />
 had remained without an opponent, he had finally to meet this rival. The contests were accompanied by the music of flutes. The name of the victor (and one whom no adversary had come forward to meet counted for victor) as well as his home were proclaimed aloud by the herald, and a palm-branch presented to him by the Hellanodicae. The actual prize he only received at the general and solemn distribution on the last day of the festival. This was originally some article of value; but at the command of the Delphic Oracle this custom was dropped, and the victors were graced by a wreath of the leaves of the sacred wild-olive, said to have been originally planted by Heracles, which had been cut with a golden knife by a boy of noble family with both parents living. After about 540 the victors also possessed the right to put up statues of themselves in the Altis.</p>
 <p>The festival ended with a sacrifice made by the victors wearing their crowns at the six double altars of the hill of Cronus, and with a banquet in the Prytaneum of the Altis. Brilliant distinctions awaited the victor on his return home, for his victory was deemed to have reflected honour on his native land at large. He made his entry, clad in purple, upon a chariot drawn by four white horses, amid the joyous shouts of all the people, and then rode amid an exultant escort to the temple of the highest god, and there deposited his wreath as a votive offering. During the ride, as also at the banquet which followed thereupon, the song of victory, often composed by the most celebrated poets, was chanted by choral bands. There was no lack of other rewards: at Athens the Olympian victor received 500 drachmae, the right to a place of honour at all public games, and board in the Prytaneum for the rest of his life. The opportunity afforded by the assembling of so vast a crowd from all parts of Greece at Olympia was utilized, from about the middle of the fifth century before Christ, by authors, orators, poets, and artists to make themselves known in the widest circles by the recital or exhibition of their works. When the compliment of a crown was offered by one State to another, the distinction was made generally known by being proclaimed by the heralds at the Olympian Games.</p>
 <p>The buildings that formerly stood upon the Olympian plain are described by Pausanias in the sixth book of his work; and since the German archaeologists began in 1875 their explorations and excavations on its site, the ground-plans of nearly all these structures have been traced from existing remains. A good account of these excavations and of their discoveries will be found in the article by Flasch in Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler</title>, cited below. In 1895 preparations were begun in Athens under the patronage of the king of Greece for a celebration of the ancient games to be held in 1896.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπία</foreign>). A small plain in Elis where the Olympian Games were held. It was surrounded on the north by the hill Cronus or Cronius, on the south by the river Alpheus, and <cb /> on the west by the river Cladeus. Within its limits was the sacred precinct of Zeus called <foreign lang="greek">Ἄλτις</foreign> (a dialectic form of <foreign lang="greek">ἄλσος</foreign>, “grove”).

<div2 id="crossolympias" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Olympias">Olympias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιάς</foreign>). A period of four years from one celebration of the Olympian Games (see <ref type="cross" target="crossolympia">Olympia</ref>) to another. The Olympiads were counted from the victory of Coroebus (B.C. 776); the last, the 283d, ended A.D. 394, with the abolition of the Olympian Games. This method of reckoning never passed into everyday life, but is of importance, inasmuch as, through the historian Timaeus, about B.C. 240, it became the one generally used by the Greek historians.</p>
 <p>Subjoined for the use of the student is a list of the Olympiads with the years of the Christian era corresponding to them from the beginning of the Olympiads to A.D. 301. To save space the separate years of each Olympiad, with the corresponding years B.C., are only given from the 47th to the 126th Olympiad, as this is the most important period of Grecian history; in the other Olympiads the first year only is given. In consulting the following table it must be borne in mind that the Olympic Games were celebrated about midsummer, and that the Attic year commenced at about the same time. If, therefore, an event happened in the second half of the Attic year, the year B.C. must be reduced by 1. Thus Socrates was put to death in the first year of the 95th Olympiad, which corresponds in the following table to B.C. 400; but as his death happened in Thargelion, the 11th month of the Attic year, the year B.C. must be reduced by 1, which gives us B.C. 399, the true date of his death. <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">B.C.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data"

<head orig="Olympias">Olympias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιάς</foreign>). Daughter of Neoptolemus, king of Epirus, and wife of Philip, king of Macedon, by whom she had Alexander the Great. The conduct of Olympias had given rise to the suspicion that Alexander was not the son of Philip; and the brilliant career of the Macedonian conqueror made his flatterers assign to him for a parent the Father of the Gods. Olympias herself, in the intoxication of female vanity, sanctioned the story, and Zeus was said to have approached her under the form of a serpent. The haughtiness of Olympias, or, more probably, her infidelity, led Philip to repudiate her, and contract a second <cb /> marriage with Cleopatra , the niece of King Attalus. The murder of Philip, which happened not long after, has been attributed by some to her intrigues, though with no great degree of probability. Alexander, after his accession to the throne, treated her with great respect, but did not allow her to take part in the government. At a subsequent period, after the death of Antipater (B.C. 319), Polysperchon, in order to confirm his power, recalled Olympias from Epirus, whither she had fled, and confided to her the guardianship of the young son of Alexander. She now cruelly put to death Arridaeus, son of Philip, with his wife Eurydicé, as also Nicanor, the brother of Cassander, together with many leading men of Macedonia who were inimical to her interests. Her cruelties, however, did not remain long unpunished. Cassander besieged her in Pydna, and she was obliged to surrender after an obstinate siege, and was put to death (B.C. 316).

<head orig="Olympiēum">Olympieum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιεῖον</foreign>). The temple of Olympian Zeus at Athens, in the southern part of the city, between the Acropolis and the Ilissus. It was built on the site of an ancient temple of Zeus, said to have been erected by Deucalion. The architects were Antistates, Callaeschrus, Antimachides, and Porinus. It was begun by Pisistratus about B.C. 535, continued by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes (B.C. 175-164), and completed by the Roman emperor Hadrian (A.D. 125-130). See Pausan. i. 18, 6-8, and the monograph by Bevier in the <title>Papers of the American Classical School at Athens</title>, i. 183-222 <bibl default="NO">(1885)</bibl>.

<head orig="Olympiodōrus">Olympiodorus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιόδωρος</foreign>). A name common to many individuals. The most deserving of notice are the following: (1) A native of Thebes, in Egypt, who flourished in the beginning of the fifth century of our era. He continued the history of Eunapius from A.D. 407 to 425. His work, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ὕλη Ἱστορίας</foreign> (“Materials for History”), or <foreign lang="greek">Ἱστορικοὶ Λόγοι</foreign> (“Historical Narratives”), consisted of twenty-two books. Only a fragment of it has been preserved by Photius. The work began with the seventh consulship of the emperor Honorius, and was brought down to the accession of Valentinian. It was dedicated to the younger Theodosius.</p>
 <p>(2) An Alexandrian philosopher, who flourished about the year B.C. 430. He is celebrated for his knowledge of the Aristotelian doctrines, and was the master of Proclus, who attended upon his school before he was twenty years of age.</p>
 <p>(3) A Platonic philosopher, who flourished towards the close of the sixth century. He was the author of commentaries on four of Plato's dialogues—the <title>First Alcibiades</title>, the <title>Phaedon, Gorgias</title>, and <title>Philebus.</title> The first of these contains a life of Plato, in which we meet with certain particulars relative to the philosopher not to be found elsewhere. This Olympiodorus was a native of Alexandria. The title which his commentaries bear appears to indicate by the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ φωνῆς</foreign> (“from the mouth” of Olympiodorus) that they were copied down by the hearers of the philosopher.</p>
 <p>(4) A native of Alexandria, a Peripatetic, who flourished during the latter half of the sixth century A.D. He was the author of a commentary on the meteorology of Aristotle, still extant.

<head orig="Olympus">Olympus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄλυμπος</foreign>). (1) A mountain situated in Thessaly, the summit of which (nearly 10,000 feet above the sea) rises from the region of the earth's atmosphere into the sky, and was, according to the earliest popular belief of the Greeks, the abode of the higher (hence named Olympian) gods. Below the summit, which, according to Homer's description, is never ruffled by winds or drenched with rain, but is always radiant in cloudless splendour ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 6. 42" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>vi. 42</bibl>-45), comes the region of clouds, which Zeus at one time gathers together and at another dispels; it forms the boundary between the celestial region and that of the earth, and, accordingly, Homer elsewhere implies that the clouds are the gates of heaven, which are guarded by the Horae ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5. 749" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>v. 749</bibl>). On the highest peak Zeus has his throne, and it is there that he summons the assemblies of the gods. The abodes of the other gods were imagined to be placed on the precipices and in the ravines of the mountain. When the height of the vault of heaven came to be regarded as the abode of the gods, the name Olympus was transferred to the sky.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄλυμπος</foreign>). One of the mythic poets and musicians belonging to Phrygian mythology, pupil of Marsyas. The art of flute-playing, invented by Marsyas, was supposed to have been perfected by Olympus. A Phrygian family, in which the art of flute-playing was hereditary, traced their descent from him. The Phrygian Olympus, who lived about the seventh century before Christ, invented the auletic <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>, and brought it into esteem among the Asiatic Greeks, was said to be descended from the mythical Olympus ( <title>De Mus.</title> p. 1133).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄλυνθος</foreign>). A town of Chalcidicé, at the head of the Toronaic Gulf, and the most important of the Greek cities on the coast of Macedonia. It was at the head of a confederacy of all the Greek towns in its neighbourhood, and maintained its independence, except for a short interval, when it was subject to Sparta (379-375), till it was taken and destroyed by Philip, B.C. 347. The Olynthiac orations of Demosthenes were delivered by the orator to urge the Athenians to send assistance to the city when it was attacked by Philip. When the supremacy of Sparta was destroyed by the Thebans, Olynthus recovered its independence, and even received an accession of power from Philip, who was anxious to make Olynthus a counterpoise to the influence of Athens in the north of the Aegean. With this view Philip gave Olynthus the territory of Potidaea, after he had wrested this town from the Athenians in 356. But when he had sufficiently consolidated his power to be able to set at defiance both Olynthus and Athens, he threw off the mask, and laid siege to the former city. The Olynthians <cb /> earnestly besought Athens for assistance, and were warmly supported by Demosthenes in his Olynthiac orations; but as the Athenians did not render the city any effectual assistance, it was taken and destroyed by Philip, and all its inhabitants sold as slaves (347). Olynthus was never restored. Olynthus used the town of Mecyberna as its port.

It stood on the eastern bank of the Nile, in the Ombites Nomos, and was celebrated as one of the chief seats of the worship of the crocodile. Juvenal's Fifteenth Satire is founded on a religious war between the people of Ombi and those of Tentyra, who hated the crocodile ( <bibl n="Ptol.  4. 5" default="NO">Ptol.iv. 5</bibl><bibl n="Ptol.  73" default="NO">Ptol., 73</bibl>; Aelian, <title>H.

<div2 id="crossomen" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Omen">Omen</head>

 <p> (for <seg lang="la">osmen, ausmen</seg>, from the root of <seg lang="la">audio</seg>, “something heard”). The Roman term for a favourable or unfavourable sign, especially a word spoken by chance, so far as it drew the attention of the hearers to itself and appeared to be a prognostic. An omen could be accepted or repudiated, and even taken in an arbitrary sense, except in the case of words which already had in themselves a favourable or unfavourable signification. For example, when Crassus was embarking on his unfortunate expedition against the Parthians, and a man in the harbour was selling dry figs from Caunus with the cry <title>Cauneas</title>, which sounded like <seg lang="la">cave ne eas</seg>, “beware of going,” this was an evil omen ( <title>De Div.</title> ii. 84). Men often changed an apparently evil omen into one more favourable. Thus when Caesar landed in Africa, he stumbled and fell, whereupon he embraced the earth, exclaiming, “Thus do I take possession of thee, Africa.” On festal occasions care was taken to protect oneself from evil omens; for example, when sacrifice was being made, by veiling the head, by commanding silence, and by music that drowned any word spoken. People were particularly careful at solemn addresses, Near Year greetings, and the like. On the other hand, for the sake of the good omen, it was usual to open levies and censuses by calling out those names that were of good import, such as Valerius (from <seg lang="la">valere</seg>), Salvius, from <seg lang="la">salvere</seg>, etc. ( <title>Pro Scauro</title>, 30). On one occasion the Roman soldiers refused to be led by an officer named Atrius Umber, whose name De Quincey well styles “a pleonasm of darkness.” People also made New Year's presents (<seg lang="la">strenae</seg>) to one another, so that the year might begin with a good omen. The Greeks also paid a good deal of attention to omens; and Socrates criticises this superstition ( <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1." default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Mem.</title>i.</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀνάτας</foreign>). A Greek artist, the chief representative of the Aeginetan school of sculpture in bronze, about B.C. 460. Besides statues of the gods, such as an Apollo at Pergamon, admired for its size and execution (Pausan. viii. 42. 7), we hear of groups of his, rich in figures, drawn either from the heroic epoch—as, for example, the ten Greek heroes casting lots as to who should undertake the battle with Hector—or from contemporary history, such as the votive offering of the Tarentines, containing equestrian and pedestrian combatants, and consecrated at Delphi for their victory over the barbarian Peucetians. He also executed a group representing Hiero of Syracuse with the chariot in which he had been victorious at Olympia. His most remarkable work was the bronze figure of the black Demeter, in a cavern thirty stadia from Phigalea, in the southeast corner of Elis (Pausan. viii. 42, 1).

Literally, “word-making”; (1) the coining of a word to imitate some natural sound; and 
<pb n="1136" /><cb /></p>
 <p>(2) a word so made. Both Greek and Latin possess many imitative words, the greater part of which mimic the sounds made by animals, birds, and insects. Such are the Greek <foreign lang="greek">βῆ βῆ</foreign> (the English “baa”), <foreign lang="greek">κρώζω</foreign> (“to croak”), <foreign lang="greek">γρῦ</foreign> (“a grunt”), <foreign lang="greek">πιπίζω</foreign> (“to peep,” of birds), <foreign lang="greek">κοάξ</foreign> (the sound made by frogs), <foreign lang="greek">κοι·, κοΐζω</foreign> (of swine, “queek”), <foreign lang="greek">ὠρύω</foreign> (“to roar”), <foreign lang="greek">τιτίζω</foreign> (“to twitter”), <foreign lang="greek">ὑλάω</foreign> (“to howl”). Other excellent imitative words are <foreign lang="greek">βαβάζω</foreign> (“to babble”), <foreign lang="greek">βόμβος</foreign> (“a booming”), <foreign lang="greek">κρόταλον</foreign> (“a rattle”), <foreign lang="greek">χάω</foreign> (“to yawn”), <foreign lang="greek">πτύω</foreign> (“to spit”), <foreign lang="greek">χρέμπτομαι</foreign> (“to hawk”), <foreign lang="greek">πτάρνυμαι</foreign> (“to sneeze”), <foreign lang="greek">ῥοφέω</foreign> (“to suck”). In Latin, though Quintilian (l. c.) regards the language as poor in onomatopoeias, the number is really very large. Good examples are <seg lang="la">baubor</seg> (“bow-wow”), <hi rend="italic">bee</hi> (“baa”), <seg lang="la">bubo</seg> (“owl”), <seg lang="la">cachinno</seg> (“to cackle”), <hi rend="italic">cocococo</hi> (“cluck”), <seg lang="la">crocio</seg> (“croak”), <seg lang="la">flo</seg> (“to blow”), <hi rend="italic">glut-glut</hi> (“gurgle”), <seg lang="la">hinnio</seg> (“whinny”), <hi rend="italic">minurrio</hi> (“to coo”), <seg lang="la">raucus</seg> (“hoarse”), <seg lang="la">stloppus</seg> (“a slap”), <seg lang="la">susurrus</seg> (“a whisper”), <seg lang="la">zinzala</seg> (“a mosquito”).</p>
 <p>Onomatopoeia of a higher type than mere wordmaking is found in literature, where the poets, especially, often make the sound of their lines harmonize with the sense most effectively. Homer is rich in such verses. Thus, the falling of the sea has been much admired ( <bibl n="Hom.

 <p>The following ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 4. 174" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iv. 174</bibl>) is written of the Cyclopes at the forge, and is the Anvil Chorus of antiquity: <lb />Illi inter sese magna vi bracchia tollunt.</p>

 <p>where the dactylic movement and the recurrent liquids give the exact effect desired.</p>
 <p>A late Latin poem, called <title>De Philomela</title>, collects all the words used in imitation of the sounds made by animals; and Suetonius, in his <title>Pratum</title>, made an even longer list, which is preserved in a fragment edited by Reifferscheid <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1890)</bibl>.</p>

She undertook to guide the new-comers to a spring; and, for that purpose, left the child lying on the grass, where a serpent found and killed it. The Argive leaders slew the serpent and buried the child. Amphiaraüs, the famous soothsayer and warrior, augured ill-luck from this event, and called the child <hi rend="SmallCaps">Archemŏrus</hi> (“Fate-beginner”), as indicative of the evils that were to befall the chieftains.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, son of the preceding, was praetor in B.C. 125, in which year he took Fregellae, which had revolted against the Romans. He belonged to the high aristocratic party, and was a violent opponent of C. Gracchus. He was consul in 121, and took the leading part in the proceedings which ended in the murder of Gracchus. Opimius and his party abused their victory most savagely, and are said to have killed more than 300 persons. (For details, see <ref type="cross" target="crossgracchus">Gracchus</ref>.) In the following year (120) he was accused of having put Roman citizens to death without trial; but he was defended by the consul C. Papirius Carbo, and was acquitted. In 112 he was at the head of the commission which was sent into Africa in order to divide the dominions of Micipsa between Iugurtha and Adherbal, and was bribed by Iugurtha, to assign to him the better part of the country (Sall. <title>Iug.</title> 16, 40). Three years after he was condemned under the law of the tribune C. Mamilius Limetanus, by which an inquiry was made into the conduct of all those who had received bribes from Iugurtha. Opimius went into exile to Dyrrhachium in Epirus, where he lived for some years, hated and insulted by the people, and where he eventually died in great poverty. He richly deserved his punishment, and met with a due recompense for his cruel and ferocious conduct towards C. Gracchus and his party. Cicero, on the contrary, who, after his consulship, had identified himself with the aristocratic party, frequently laments the fate of Opimius. The year in which Opimius was consul (121) was remarkable for the extraordinary heat of the autumn, and thus the vintage of this year was of an unprecedented quality. This wine long remained celebrated as the <title>vinum Opimianum</title> ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 83" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Brut.83</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Brut. 287" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic.

<div2 id="crossoracula" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Oracŭla">Oracula</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μαντεῖα</foreign>, “oracular responses,” or the “seats of oracles”; <foreign lang="greek">χρηστήρια</foreign> is used in the same senses, and also of victims offered by persons consulting an oracle). The seats of the worship of some special divinity, where prophecies were imparted with the sanction of the divinity, either by the priests themselves or with their co-operation. There were many such places in all Greek countries, and these may be divided, according to the method in which the prophecy was made known, into four main divisions: (1) oral oracles, (2) oracles by signs, (3) oracles by dreams, and (4) oracles of the dead.</p>
 <p>(1) The most revered oracles were those of the first class, where the divinity, almost invariably the god Apollo, orally revealed his will through the lips of inspired prophets or prophetesses. The condition of frenzy was produced, for the most part, by physical influences: the breathing of earthy vapours or drinking of the water of oracular fountains. The words spoken while in this state were generally fashioned by the priests into a reply to the questions proposed to them. The most famous oracle of this kind was that of Delphi (see further below). Besides this there existed in Greece Proper a large number of oracles of Apollo, as at Abae in Phocis, in different places of Boeotia, in Euboea, and at Argos, where the priestess derived her inspiration from drinking the blood of a lamb, one being killed every month. Not less numerous were the oracles of Apollo in Asia Minor. Among these that of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus traced its origin to the old family of the Branchidae, the descendants of Apollo's son Branchus. Before its destruction by Xerxes, it came nearest to the reputation of the Delphian. Here it was a priestess who prophesied, seated on a wheel-shaped disc, after she had bathed the hem of her robe and her feet in a spring, and had breathed the steam arising from it. The oracle at Clarus, near Colophon (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmanto">Manto</ref>), was also very ancient. Here a priest, after simply hearing the names and the number of those consulting the oracle, drank of the water of a spring, and then gave answer in verse.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The most venerated among the oracles where prophecy was given by signs was that of Zeus of <ref type="cross" target="crossdodona">Dodona</ref> (q.v.), mentioned as early as Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 14. 327" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xiv. 327</bibl>-xix. 296), where predictions were made from the rustling of the sacred oak, and at a later time from the sound of a brazen cymbal. Another mode of interpreting by signs, as practised especially at the temple of Zeus at Olympia by the Iamidae, or descendants of Iamus, a son of Apollo, <cb /> was that derived from the entrails of victims and the burning of the sacrifices on the altar. There were also oracles connected with the lot or dice, one especially at the temple of Heracles at Bura, in Achaia; and prophecies were also delivered at Delphi by means of lots, probably only at times when the Pythia was not giving responses. The temple of the Egyptian Ammon, who was identified with Zeus, also gave oracles by means of signs.
 </p>
 <p>(3) Oracles given in dreams were generally connected with the temples of Asclepius. After certain preliminary rites, sick persons had to sleep in these temples; the priests interpreted their dreams, and dictated, accordingly, the means to be taken to insure recovery. The most famous of these oracular shrines of the healing god was the temple at Epidaurus, and next to this the temple founded thence at Pergamum, in Asia Minor. Equally famous were the similar oracles of the seer Amphiaraüs at Oropus, of Trophonius at Lebadea, in Boeotia, and of the seers Mopsus and Amphilochus at Mallus, in <ref type="cross" target="crosscilicia">Cilicia</ref> (q.v.). In later times such oracles were connected with all sanctuaries of Isis and Serapis.
 </p>
 <p>(4) At oracles of the dead (<foreign lang="greek">ψυχομαντεῖα</foreign>) the souls of deceased persons were evoked in order to give the information desired. Thus, in Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. xi" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xi</bibl>), Odysseus betakes himself to the entrance of the lower world to question the spirit of the seer Tiresias. Oracles of this kind were especially common in places where it was supposed there was an entrance to the lower world; as at the city of Cichyrus in Epirus (where there was an Acherusian lake as well as the rivers of Acheron and Cocytus, bearing the same names as those of the world below), at the promontory of Taenarum in Laconia, at Heraclea in Pontus, and at Lake Avernus, near Cumae, in Italy. At most of them oracles were also given in dreams; but there were some in which the inquirer was in a waking condition when he conjured up the spirits whom he wished to question.</p>
 <p>While oracles derived either from dreams or from the dead were chosen in preference by superstitious people, the most important among oral oracles and those given by means of signs had a political significance. On all serious occasions they were questioned on behalf of the State in order to ascertain the divine will: this was especially the case with the oracle of Delphi. In consequence of the avarice and partisanship of the priests, as well as the increasing decline of belief in the gods, the oracles gradually fell into abeyance, to revive again everywhere under the Roman emperors, though they never regained the political importance they had once had in ancient Greece.</p>
 <p>Such investigation of the divine will was originally quite foreign to the Romans. Even the mode of prophesying by means of lots (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssortes">Sortes</ref>), practised in isolated regions of Italy, and even in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, as at Caeré, and especially at Praenesté, did not come into use, at all events for State purposes, and was generally regarded with contempt. The Romans did not consult even the Sibylline verses in order to forecast the future. On the other hand, the growth of superstition in the imperial period not only brought the native oracles into repute, but caused a general resort to foreign oracles besides. The inclination to this kind of 
<pb n="1139" /><cb />
 prophecy seems never to have been more generally spread among the masses of the people than at this time. Apart from the Greek oracular deities, there were the oriental deities, whose worship was nearly everywhere combined with predictions. In most of the famous sanctuaries the most various forms of prophecy were represented, and the stranger they were the better they were liked. In the case of the oral oracles, the responses in earlier times were, for the most part, composed in verse; on the decay of poetic productiveness, they began to take the form of prose, or of passages from the poets, the Greeks generally adopting lines of Homer or Euripides; the Italians, lines of Vergil. The public declaration of oracles ended with the official extermination of paganism under Theodosius at the end of the fourth century.</p>
 <p>The following is a list of the most celebrated oracles:</p>
 <p>(1) Of Zeus: at Dodona, in Epirus, the most ancient of all; at Olympia, with the Iamidae and Clytiades as its priests; and of Zeus Ammon in a Libyan oasis in the northwest of Egypt.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Of Apollo: at Delphi (see below); at Abae, in Phocis; at Tegyraia, in Boeotia; at Mount Ptoön, near Acraephia; of Apollo Ismenius, near Thebes, the national oracle of the Thebans; of Hysiae, at the base of Mount Cithaeron; at Eutresis, near Leuctra; of Apollo Didymaeus, in the territory of Miletus, with the Branchidae as its ministers; at Claros, north of Miletus; at Patara, in Lycia; at Cyaneae, in Lycia; of Apollo Sarpedonius at Seleucia, in Cilicia; at Hybla, in Magnesia; at Grynea or Grynium, in Asia Minor; at Methymna, in Lesbos; at Chalcedon; at Delos; at Argos; at Daphne, in Syria (in later times).
 </p>
 <p>(3) Of Gaea (the Earth): at Aegira, in Achaia, and at Patrae; of Pluto and Persephoné at Acharaca, in Asia Minor, near Tralles; of Bacchus, at Amphiclea, in Phocis, and at Satrae, in Thrace; of Hermes, at Pharae, in Achaia; and of the Nymphs on Mount Cithaeron.
 </p>
 <p>(4) There were also oracles of heroes—e. g. of Asclepius, at Epidaurus and Pergamus; of Trophonius, at Lebadea; of Tiresias, at Orchomenus; of Amphiaraüs, near Thebes and near Oropus; of Mopsus, at Mallos, in Cilicia; of Calchas and Podalirius, on Mount Dion, in Southern Italy; of Protesilaüs, at Elaeus, in the Thracian Chersonesus; of Autolycus, the Argonaut, at Sinopé; and of Odysseus, in Aetolia.
 </p>
 <p>(5) There were Italian oracles of Faunus at Albunea and of Fortuna at Praenesté and Antium ( <title>De Div.</title> ii. 41, 85). At Caeré and at Falerii there were “lots” (<seg lang="la">sortes</seg>), from which oracles or perhaps omens were inferred (<bibl n="Liv.  22. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxii. 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>As the Delphic oracle is by far the most famous and the one to which allusion is oftenest made in literature, a somewhat more detailed account of it may be of interest. Its seat was on the southwestern spur of Parnassus in a valley of Phocis. In historical times the oracle appears in possession of Apollo; but the original possessor, according to the story, was Gaea ( <title>Eumen.</title> 1, 2). Then it was shared by her with Poseidon (Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Ion 446" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ion</title>, 446</bibl>), who gave up his part in it to Apollo in exchange for the island of Calauria, Themis, the daughter and successor of Gaea, having already given Apollo her share. According to the Homeric hymn to the Pythian Apollo, the god took forcible possession of the oracle soon after his birth, slaying with his <cb /> earliest bow-shot the serpent Pytho, the son of Gaea, who guarded the spot. To atone for his murder, Apollo was forced to fly and spend eight years in menial service before he could return forgiven. A festival, the Septeria, was held every year, at which the whole story was represented: the slaying of the serpent, and the flight, atonement, and return of the god. Apollo was represented by a boy, both of whose parents were living. The dragon was symbolically slain, and his house, decked out in costly fashion, was burned. Then the boy's followers hastily dispersed, and the boy was taken in procession to Tempé, along the road formerly followed by the god. Here he was purified and brought back by the same road, accompanied by a chorus of maidens singing songs of joy. The oracle proper was a cleft in the ground in the innermost sanctuary, from which arose cold vapours, which had the power of inducing ecstasy. Over the cleft stood a lofty gilded tripod of wood. On this was a circular slab, upon which the seat of the prophetess was placed. The prophetess, called Pythia, was a maiden of honourable birth; in earlier times a young girl, but in a later age a woman of over fifty, still wearing a girl's dress, in memory of the earlier custom. In the prosperous times of the oracle two Pythias acted alternately, with a third to assist them. In the earliest times the Pythia ascended the tripod only once a year, on the birthday of Apollo, the seventh of the Delphian spring month Bysius. But in later years she prophesied every day, if the day itself and the sacrifices were not unfavourable. These sacrifices were offered by the supplicants, adorned with laurel crowns and fillets of wool. Having prepared herself by washing and purification, the Pythia entered the sanctuary, with gold ornaments in her hair and flowing robes upon her; she drank of the water of the fountain Cassotis, which flowed into the shrine, tasted the fruit of the old bay-tree standing in the chamber, and took her seat. No one was present but a priest, called the <foreign lang="greek">προφήτης</foreign> (and <foreign lang="greek">προφῆτις</foreign>), who explained the words she uttered in her ecstasy, and put them into metrical form, generally hexameters. In later times the votaries were contented with answers in prose. The responses were often obscure and enigmatical, and couched in ambiguous and metaphorical expressions, which themselves needed explanation. The order in which the applicants approached the oracle was determined by lot, but certain cities, as Sparta, had the right of priority.</p>
 <p>The reputation of the oracle stood very high throughout Greece until the time of the Persian Wars, especially among the Dorian tribes, and among them pre-eminently the Spartans, who had stood from of old in intimate relation with it. On all important occasions, as the sending out of colonies, the framing of internal legislation or religious ordinances, the god of Delphi was consulted, and that not only by Greeks, but by foreigners, especially the people of Asia and Italy. After the Persian Wars the influence of the oracle declined, partly in consequence of the growth of unbelief, partly from the mistrust excited by the partiality and venality of the priesthood, who sometimes were bribed into giving oracles favourable to the inquirer, and in the case of Philip of Macedon, when Demosthenes said, <foreign lang="greek">ἡ πυθία φιλιππίζει</foreign>. But it never fell completely into discredit, 
<pb n="1140" /><cb />
 and from time to time its position rose again. In the first half of the second century A.D. it had a revival, the result of the newly awakened interest in the old region. It was abolished at the end of the fourth century A.D. by Theodosius the Great.</p>
 <p>The oldest stone temple of Apollo was attributed to the mythical architects, Trophonius and Agamedes. It was burned down in B.C. 548, when the Alcmaeonidae, at that time in exile from Athens, undertook to rebuild it for the sum of 300 talents, partly taken from the treasure of the temple, and partly contributed by all countries inhabited by Greeks and standing in connection with the oracle. They put the restoration into the hands of the Corinthian architect Spintharus, who carried it out in a more splendid style than was originally agreed upon, building the front of Parian marble instead of limestone. The groups of sculpture in the pediments represented, on the eastern side, Apollo with Artemis, Leto, and the Muses; on the western side, Dionysus with the Thyiades and the setting sun; for Dionysus was worshipped here in winter during the imagined absence of Apollo. These were all the work of Praxias and Androsthenes, and were finished about B.C. 430. The temple was, on account of its vast extent, a hypaethral building—that is, there was no roof over the space occupied by the temple proper. The architecture of the exterior was Doric, of the interior Ionic, as may still be observed in the surviving ruins. On the walls of the entrance-hall were short texts written in gold, attributed to the Seven Sages. One of these was the celebrated “Know Thyself” (<foreign lang="greek">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>, Pausan. x. 24, 1). In the temple proper stood the golden statue of Apollo, and in front of it the sacrificial hearth with the eternal fire. Near this was a globe of marble covered with fillets, the <foreign lang="greek">Ὀμφαλός</foreign>, or centre of the earth. In earlier times two eagles stood at its side, representing the two eagles which fable said had been sent out by Zeus at the same moment from the eastern and western ends of the world. These eagles were carried off in the Phocian War, and their place filled by two eagles in mosaic on the floor. Behind this space was the inner shrine, lying lower, in the form of a cavern over the cleft in the earth. Within the spacious precincts (<foreign lang="greek">περίβολος</foreign>) stood a great number of chapels, statues, votive offerings, and treasure-houses of the various Greek states, in which they deposited their gifts to the sanctuary, especially the tithes of the booty taken in war. Here, too, was the council-chamber of the Delphians. Before the entrance to the temple was the great altar for burnt-offerings, and the golden tripod, dedicated by the Greeks after the battle of Plataea, on a pedestal of brass, representing a snake in three coils, and of which the greater part now stands in the Hippodrome at Constantinople. Besides the treasures accumulated in the course of time, the temple had considerable property in land, with a population consisting mainly of slaves (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερόδουλοι</foreign>), bound to pay contributions and to render service to the sanctuary. The management of the property was in the hands of priests chosen from the noble Delphian families, at their head the five <foreign lang="greek">ὅσιοι</foreign> or consecrated ones. Since the first spoliation of the temple by the Phocians in B.C. 355, it was several times plundered on a grand scale. Nero, for instance, is said to have carried off 500 bronze statues. Yet some <cb /> 3000 statues were to be seen there in the time of the elder Pliny.</p>

The earliest orators at Rome got their knowledge practically by observing the pleadings of the older men and by advice, experience, and trial of themselves. Under the Empire the principal speakers were trained in the schools of the rhetoricians (see <ref type="cross" target="crossrhetorica">Rhetorica</ref>), and thus gradually lost the power and form of the earlier style of speaking ( <bibl n="Petron.  i" default="NO">Petron.i</bibl>).

It was situated northwest of the lake Copa ïs, on the river Cephissus. Sixty years after the Trojan War it was taken by the Boeotians, and became a member of the Boeotian League. It continued to exist as an independent town till B.C. 367, when it was taken and destroyed by the Thebans; and though subsequently rebuilt by the Phocians, the Thebans again demolished it.

<div2 id="crossorestes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Orestes">Orestes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀρέστης</foreign>). (1) The son of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra. On the assassination of Agamemnon, Orestes, then quite young, was saved from his father's fate by his sister Electra, who had him removed to the court of their uncle Strophius, king of Phocis. There he formed an intimate friendship with Pylades, the son of Strophius, and with him concerted the means, which he successfully adopted, of avenging his father's death by slaying his mother and Aegisthus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaegisthus">Aegisthus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossclytaemnestra">Clytaemnestra</ref>.) After the murder of Clytaemnestra, the Furies drove Orestes into insanity; and when the oracle at Delphi was consulted respecting the duration of his malady, an answer was given that Orestes would not be restored to a sane mind until he went to the Tauric Chersonesus, and brought away <figure id="fig.01142">
<head orig="Orestes and Aegisthus. (From a vase.)">Orestes and Aegisthus. (From a vase.)</head>
</figure> from that quarter the statue of Artemis to Argos. It was the custom in Taurica to sacrifice all strangers to this goddess, and Orestes and Pylades, having made the journey together, and having both been taken captive, were brought as victims to the altar of Artemis. Iphigenia, the sister of Orestes, who had been carried off by Artemis from Aulis when on the point of being immolated (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaulis">Aulis</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossiphigenia">Iphigenia</ref>), was the priestess of the goddess among the Tauri. Perceiving the strangers to be Greeks, she offered to spare the life of one of them, provided he would carry a letter from her to Greece. This occasioned a memorable contest of friendship between them, which should sacrifice himself for the other, and it ended in Pylades' yielding to Orestes and agreeing to be the bearer of the letter. The letter was for Orestes, and a discovery was the consequence. Iphigenia, thereupon, on learning <cb /> the object of their visit, contrived to aid them in carrying off the statue of Artemis, and all three arrived safe in Greece with the statue. After his return to the Peloponnesus, Orestes took possession of his father's kingdom at Mycenae, which had been usurped by Aletes or Menelaüs. When Cylarabes of Argos died without leaving any heir, Orestes also became king of Argos. The Lacedaemonians likewise made him their king of their own accord, because they preferred him, the grandson of Tyndareus, to Nicostratus and Megapenthes, the sons of Menelaüs by a slave. The Arcadians and Phocians increased his power by allying themselves with him. He married Hermioné, the daughter of Menelaüs, and became by her the father of Tisamenus. The story of his marriage with Hermioné, who had previously been married to Neoptolemus, is related elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshermione">Hermioné</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossneoptolemus">Neoptolemus</ref>.) He died of the bite of a snake in Arcadia, and his body, in accordance with an oracle, was afterwards carried from Tega to Sparta, and there buried. His bones are said to have been found at a later time in a war between the Lacedaemonians and Tegaetans, and to have been conveyed to Sparta ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 67</bibl>). According to one story, Orestes spent the time of his madness in Arcadia, where, in his frenzy, he gnawed off one of his fingers (Pausan. viii. 34, 2). The story of Orestes is the subject of an existing trilogy by Aeschylus (the <title>Agamemnon, Choephoroe</title>, and <title>Eumenides</title>), and is treated by Sophocles in his <title>Electra</title> and by Euripides in the remaining plays <title>Electra, Orestes</title>, and <title>Iphigenia in Tauris.</title> See Becker, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Orestessage der Griechen</title> (Wittenberg, 1858)</bibl>.

 <p>Such is the ordinary form of the legend of Orestes. The tragic writers, of course, introduced many variations. Thus it is said that when the Furies of his mother persecuted him, he fled to Delphi, whose god had urged him to commit the deed, and thence went to Athens, where he was acquitted by the court of Areopagus. Orestes had by Hermioné two sons, Tisamenus and Penthilus, who were driven from their country by the Heraclidae.</p>
 <p>(2) A Pannonian who acted as regent of Italy during the short reign of his infant son Romulus Augustulus, in favour of whom he had deposed the emperor Iulius Nepos (A.D. 475). In the following year he was defeated and put to death by Odoacer, king of the Heruli.

 <p> usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Orĭgen</hi>. A learned Christian Father, born at Alexandria in A.D. 185. He was converted to Christianity by Clement of Alexandria, and after the martyrdom of his father, Leonides, Origen opened a school in which at first he taught Greek literature only, but soon after Christian doctrine also. Being made head of the catechetical school of Alexandria, he became distinguished for his severe asceticism as for his profound learning, not only in theology, but also in Greek philosophy and Hebrew, which he learned at Rome. In A.D. 228, during a visit to Palestine, he was ordained presbyter, but Bishop Demetrius of Alexandria refused his assent to this both as not being given by himself as diocesan bishop and because Origen, through a fanatical interpretation of Matt. xix. 12, had castrated himself. Later, the controversy which began over this decision led to a close investigation of Origen's theological views, and these were condemned by a synod in A.D. 231. Many Eastern bishops, however, supported him, and he reopened his school at Caesarea. During the later persecutions of the Christians by Maximinus and Decius he suffered greatly, so that, his health breaking down, he died at Tyre in A.D. 254. His most controverted teachings were those on the subject of the ultimate salvation of all, as he taught that even the devils would finally be redeemed—a doctrine known as Restorationism. His writings in all numbered some 6000, of which comparatively few have been preserved. An important one (the <title>De Principiis</title>) survives only in a Latin version by Rufinus. There are also a treatise on martyrdom and a defence of Christianity against Celsus; and of his <title>Hexapla</title>—an edition of the Old Testament in six parallel columns in Hebrew, Hebrew transliterated in Greek letters, and the four versions by Aquila, Symmachus, the Septuagint, and Theodotion—a number of fragments remain.

<head orig="Orīon">Orion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὠρίων</foreign>). A celebrated giant, said by one legend to have been the son of Poseidon and Euryalé. His father, according to this same account, gave him the power of wading through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of walking on its surface. He married Sidé, whom Heré cast into Erebus for contending with her in beauty ( <bibl n="Apollod.  1.4.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.i.4.3</bibl>). Another and more common account makes Hyria, a town of Boeotia, to have been the birthplace of Orion , and the story of his origin is told as follows: As Zeus, Poseidon, and Hermes were taking a ramble upon earth, they came, late in the evening, to the house of a farmer named Hyrieus. Seeing the wayfarers, Hyrieus, who was standing at his door, invited them to enter, and pass the night in his humble abode. The gods accepted the kind invitation, and were hospitably entertained. Pleased with their host, they inquired if he had any wish which he desired to have gratified. Hyrieus replied that he once had a wife whom he tenderly loved, and that he had sworn never to marry another. She was dead; he was childless; his vow was binding; and yet he was desirous of being a father. The gods took the hide of his only ox, which he, on discovering their true nature, had sacrificed in their honour: they buried it in the earth; and ten months afterwards a boy came to light, whom Hyrieus named Urion or Orion (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρεῖν</foreign>, Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, v. 495 foll.;  <bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 195" default="NO" valid="yes">Hyg. <title>Fab.</title>195</bibl>). This legend owes its origin to the name Orion , and was the invention of the Athenians (Müller, <title>Orchom.</title> p. 99). In Hyginus, Hyrieus is Byrseus, from the hide (<foreign lang="greek">βύρσα</foreign>).</p>
 <p>When Orion grew up, he went, according to this same account, to the island of Chios, where he became enamoured of Aero or Meropé, the daughter of Oenopion, son of Dionysus and Ariadné. He sought her in marriage; but, while wooing, seized a favourable opportunity and offered her violence. Her father, incensed at this conduct, and having made Orion drunk, blinded him, and cast him on the seashore. The blinded hero contrived to reach Lemnos, and came to the forge of Hephaestus, who, taking pity on him, gave him Cedalion (Guardian), one of his men, to be his guide to the abode of the Sun. Placing Cedalion on his shoulder, Orion proceeded to the East; and there, meeting the sun-god, was restored to vision by his beams. Anxious for revenge on Oenopion, he returned to Chios; but the Chians, aware of his intention, concealed the object of his search under the ground, and Orion , unable to find him, returned to Crete. The death of Orion is variously related. As all the legends relating to him are evidently later than the time of Homer, none ventures to assign any other cause to it than the goddess Artemis, whose wrath (though Homer rather says the contrary) he drew on himself. Some said that he attempted to offer violence to the goddess herself; others to Opis, one of her Hyperborean maidens, and that Artemis slew him with her arrows; others, again, that it was for presuming to challenge the goddess at the discus. It was also said that, when he came to Crete, he boasted to Leto and Artemis that he was able to kill anything that would come from the earth. Indignant at his boast, they sent a scorpion, which stung him, and he died. It was said, finally, that Artemis loved Orion , and was even about to marry him. Her brother was highly displeased, and often reproached her, but to no purpose. At length, observing one day Orion wading through the sea <cb /> with his head just above the waters, he pointed it out to his sister, and maintained that she could not hit that black thing on the water. To show her skill she took aim and hit it, thus slaying Orion ( <bibl n="Luc. Astr. 2. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Astr.</title>ii. 34</bibl>). Asclepius attempted to restore him to life, but was slain by Zeus with a thunderbolt.

 charges brought against Christianity by showing that it was not to Christianity and the abolition of the heathen religion that the calamities of the time were due, but that such calamities had always existed, and to a still greater degree before Christian times.

<head orig="Orpheus">Orpheus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀρφεύς</foreign>). A mythical personage, regarded by the Greeks as the most celebrated of the early poets, who lived before the time of Homer. His name does not occur in the Homeric or Hesiodic poems; but it had already attained to great celebrity in the lyric period. There were numerous legends about Orpheus, but the common story ran as follows: Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus and Calliopé, lived in Thrace at the period of the Argonauts, whom he accompanied in their expedition. Presented with the lyre by Apollo and instructed by the Muses in its use, he enchanted with its music not only the wild beasts, but the trees and rocks upon Olympus, so that they moved from their places to follow the sound of his golden harp. The power of his music caused the Argonauts to seek his aid, which contributed materially to the success of their expedition; at the sound of his lyre the Argo glided down into the sea; the Argonauts tore themselves away from the pleasures of Lemnos; the Symplegades, or moving rocks, which threatened to crush the ship between them, were fixed in their places; and the Colchian dragon, which guarded the Golden Fleece, was lulled to sleep; other legends of the same kind may be read in the <title>Argonautica</title>, which bears the name of Orpheus. After his return from the Argonautic expedition he took up his abode in a cave in Thrace, and employed himself in the civilization of its wild inhabitants. There is also a legend of his having visited Egypt. The legends respecting the loss and recovery of his wife, and his own death, are very various. His wife was a nymph named Agriopé or Eurydicé. In the older accounts the cause of her death is not referred to. The legend followed in the well-known passages of Vergil and Ovid, which ascribes the death of Eurydicé to the bite of a serpent, is no doubt of high antiquity; but the introduction of Aristaeus into the legend cannot be traced to any writer older than Vergil himself. He followed his lost wife into the abodes of Hades, where the charms of his lyre suspended the torments of the damned, and won back his wife from the most inexorable of all deities; but his prayer was only granted upon this condition: that he should not look back upon his restored wife till they arrived in the upper world; at the very moment when they were about to pass the fatal bounds, the anxiety of love overcame the poet; he looked round to see that Eurydicé was following him; and he beheld her caught back into the infernal regions. (See illustration, p. 643.) His grief for the loss of Eurydicé <cb /> led him to treat with contempt the Thracian women, who, in revenge, tore him to pieces under the excitement of their Bacchanalian orgies. After his death the Muses collected the fragments of his body, and buried them at Libethra at the foot of Olympus, where the nightingale sang sweetly over his grave. His head was thrown into the Hebrus, down which it rolled to the sea, and was borne across to Lesbos, where the grave in which it was interred was shown at Antissa. His lyre was also said to have been carried to Lesbos; and both traditions are simply poetical expressions of the historical fact that Lesbos was the first great seat of the music of the lyre; indeed, Antissa itself was the birthplace of Terpander, the earliest historical musician. The astronomers taught that the lyre of Orpheus was placed by Zeus among the stars at the intercession of Apollo and the Muses. Orpheus is spoken of as the first diviner, the first to employ the rites of expiation, the inventor of letters and of the heroic metre—in fact, as the first civilizer of early Thracia and Greece. In these legends there are some points which are sufficiently clear. The invention of music, in connection with the services of Apollo and the Muses, its first great application to the worship of the gods, which Orpheus is therefore said to have introduced, its power over the passions, and the importance which the Greeks attached to the knowledge of it, as intimately allied with the very existence of all social order, are probably the chief elementary ideas of the whole legend. But here comes in one of the dark features of the Greek religion, in which the gods envy the advancement of man in knowledge and civilization, and severely punish any one who transgresses the bounds assigned to humanity. In a later age the conflict was no longer viewed as between the gods and man, but between the worshippers of different divinities; and especially between Apollo, the symbol of pure intellect, and Dionysus, the deity of the senses; hence Orpheus, the servant of Apollo, falls a victim to the jealousy of Dionysus and the fury of his worshippers. The story of Orpheus and Eurydicé is found in a reversed form in the ancient Keltic tale of the three daughters of King O'Hara. (See Curtin, <title>Myths and Folk-lore of Ireland</title> [Boston, 1890].) It has been the theme of many works of modern literature, of which (in English) may be mentioned the following poems: Wordsworth, <title>The Power of Music;</title> Browning, <title>Orpheus and Eurydicé;</title> W. Morris, <title>Orpheus and the Sirens;</title> R. Lowell, <title>Eurydicé;</title> Dowden, <title>Eurydicé;</title> Gosse, <title>The Waking of Eurydicé;</title> and R. Buchanan, <title>Orpheus the Musician.</title> The story of Orpheus is the subject of a series of ten fine paintings by Burne-Jones.

<head orig="Orphĭca">Orphica</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ὀρφικά</foreign>). <ref type="cross" target="crossorpheus">Orpheus</ref> (q.v.) gave his name to a kind of monastic order which sprang up in later times in Greece calling themselves <foreign lang="greek">οἱ Ὀρφικοί</foreign>, who, under the pretended guidance of Orpheus, dedicated themselves to the worship of Dionysus. They performed the rites of a mystical worship; but instead of confining their notions to the initiated, they published them to others, and committed them to literary works. The Dionysus with whose worship the Orphic rites were connected was Dionysus Zagreus, closely connected with Demeter and Cora (Persephoné). The Orphic legends and poems related in great part to this 
<pb n="1146" /><cb /> Dionysus, who was combined, as an infernal deity, with Hades; and upon whom the Orphic theologians founded their hopes of the purification and ultimate immortality of the soul. But their mode of celebrating this worship was very different from the popular rites of Bacchus. The Orphic worshippers of Bacchus did not indulge in unrestrained pleasures and frantic enthusiasm, but rather aimed at an ascetic purity of life and manners, abstaining from meat, though not from wine, dressing in white, practising frequent purifications, expiations, and incantations, and professing a creed, in which the doctrine of the transmigration of souls (metempsychosis) held an important place. This sect degenerated by the time of the early Roman Empire into a mere fraternity of jugglers, and died out finally amid general contempt.</p>
 <p>All the part of the mythology of Orpheus which connects him with Dionysus must be considered as a later invention, quite irreconcilable with the original legend, in which he is the servant of Apollo and the Muses; but it is almost hopeless to explain the transition.</p>
 <p>Connected with the Orphic cult is the so-called Orphic literature. Many poems ascribed to Orpheus were current as early as the time of the Pisistratidae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossonomacritus">Onomacritus</ref>.) They are often quoted by Plato, and the allusions to them in later writers are very frequent. The extant poems, which bear the name of Orpheus, are the forgeries of grammarians and philosophers of the Alexandrian School; but among the fragments, which form a part of the collection, are some genuine remains of that Orphic poetry which was known to Plato, and which must be assigned to the period of Onomacritus, or perhaps a little earlier. To the original portions, which grew under the hands of the Orphici into a vast literature, were added also interpretations and liturgies by the Pythagoreans, some of whose doctrines were akin to those of the Orphic brotherhood. Aristotle and even Herodotus attacked the pretended antiquity of the Orphic works, yet the myths and songs retained their acceptance as antiques down to the third and fourth centuries A.D., when we find them quoted by the Fathers. The Orphic literature, which, in this sense, may be called genuine, seems to have included hymns, a theogony, oracles, etc. The principal productions which have come down to us are: (1) <title>Argonautica</title>, an epic poem in 1394 hexameters, giving an account of the expedition of the Argonauts;</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Hymns</title>, eighty-seven or eighty-eight in number, in hexameters, evidently the productions of the Neo-Platonic School;</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Lithica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Λιθικά</foreign>) treating of properties of stones, both precious and common, and their uses in divination;</p>
 <p>(4) fragments, chiefly of the <title>Theogony</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεογονία</foreign>), which show the influence of Hesiod. It is in this class that we find the genuine remains of the literature of the early Orphic theology, but intermingled with others of a much later date. There are also a number of other poems, of which a list is given in Christ's <title>Griechische Litteraturgeschichte</title> (pp. 658, 659).</p>

<div2 id="crossosci" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Osci">Osci</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Opĭci.</hi> The name Opiscan or Oscan, properly Opscian language (<foreign lang="greek">φωνὴ Ὀπικῶν; τῶν Ὄσκων ἡ διάλεκτος</foreign>), was first applied by the Greek colonists of the coast of Campania to the dialect of the Italic race of <foreign lang="greek">Ὁπικοί</foreign> (<title>Opici</title>) or <foreign lang="greek">Ὄσκοι</foreign> (<title>Opsci</title>, prop. <title>Opisci</title>) whom they found to be the chief inhabitants of that region. The Opici have been occasionally identified with the Ausones, also inhabiting Campania, and certainly closely related to them, and to the Aurunci, living on the neighbouring coast of Latium, and probably also to the Sidicini, who settled the middle valley of the Volturnus. The association of the Aurunci, on the other hand, with the aborigines, once living farther north in Southern Sabini, about Reaté, appears to be more than doubtful. The Oscans were not unsusceptible to Greek civilization; they constructed an excellent alphabet of twenty-one characters from the Greek: <seg lang="la">a, b, g, d, e, v, z, h, i, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, w, f, í</seg> (sound between <seg lang="la">i</seg> and <seg lang="la">e</seg>), and <hi rend="italic">ú</hi> (sound between <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <seg lang="la">o</seg>). The signs for <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> are interchangeable, according to pronunciation indicating either letter; the peculiar Italic spirant <hi rend="italic">f</hi> takes the place of the aspirates; the <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is vocal <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as well as sibilant-dental (=<hi rend="italic">ts, ds</hi>); rewritten in Greek and Latin, <hi rend="italic">ú</hi> is regularly represented by <seg lang="la">o</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">í</hi> occasionally by <foreign lang="greek">ε</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign>), <seg lang="la">e.</seg></p>
 <p>The Etruscan supremacy in Campania from about B.C. 800 to 400 appears, as in Rome, to have been exercised by a small military aristocracy, and therefore very superficial. We have no written 
<pb n="1147" /><cb /> traces of them other than a number of inscriptions on vases, partly in a mixed language mainly Oscan, so that it may be inferred that the Etruscan supremacy, even if it broke the national power of the Oscans, yet rather advanced than suppressed their language and culture.</p>
 <p>But when the Romans reached the region, about B.C. 380, the Oscan race, as well as the Ausones, <figure id="fig.01147">
<head orig="Oscan Inscription from Pompeii.">Oscan Inscription from Pompeii.</head>
</figure> had disappeared, absorbed by the Campanians, closely related to the Samnites, who had rushed down from the mountains, and made a sudden end of the Etruscan rule. From that time the Romans designated by the name <title>lingua Opsca</title> or <title>Osca</title> (also <title>Obsca</title>, by a leaning to <hi rend="italic">obscaenus</hi>) not only the language of these Campanians, but that of the whole Samnite race, which then spread extensively over Southern Italy. And, in fact, the monuments of the language that have come down to us, and which are recognizable as Oscan, are found in an area of about 1000 square miles, almost as extensive as the Samnite territory—i. e. in Samnium proper (the land of the Caraceni, the Pentri, and Caudini), in the provinces of their descendants the Frent(r)ani in the east, the Hirpini in the south, as well as the adjacent parts of Apulia and Lucania, which they subdued, and above all, most numerously in Campania, whence the Mamertini carried the language to Bruttium (Vibo) and Sicily (Messana). The Oscan inscription of Nesce (Nersae) farther north, in the territory of the Aequicoli, is iso<figure id="fig.01147.2">
<head orig="Oscan Inscription known as “The Curse of Vibia.” (Leaden plate found at Capua in 1876.)">Oscan Inscription from Pompeii.</head>
</figure> lated. Finally, the coins of the Aurunci, who were perhaps conquered long before, have Oscan words and characters. The entire number of Oscan remains is about 200, and of these only four are important—the so-called municipal laws of Bantia (<title>tabula Bantina</title>); the treaty of temple-boundary between Nola and Abella (<title>cippus Abellanus</title>); the <cb /> votive inscription (more properly an “inventory of temenos”) of Agnoné; and the lead plate of Capua with the Curse of Vibia.</p>
 <p>Chronologically these remains extend from about B.C. 400 to the early Empire. Only the inscriptions found north of the Aufidus and Silarus show the Oscan alphabet; the southern have Greek or, as in the case of the Tabula Bantina, Latin characters. However, as their name shows and tradition confirms, the Samnite tribes were derived from the Sabines: <title>Samnium=Sab(i)nium, Saf(i)nium;</title> on the coins of the Social War, <title>Safinum</title> (not gen. pl.); cf. the softening in Greek <foreign lang="greek">Σαυνῖται, Σαυνῖτις χώρα</foreign>. According to an old tradition, the Sabines in a war with the Umbrians sent out their finest young soldiers as <seg lang="la">ver sacrum</seg> (q. v.), who formed the stock of the Samnite race, and who again continued its extension in Southern Italy by like means. This Samnite people must therefore have originally used a Sabellian dialect; but the language of none of the Oscan remains can pass as such. If this difficulty be solved, nothing remains but to assume that after the Campanians the other Samnites appropriated the language of the more civilized Oscans and kindred tribes whom they had conquered, so that they both used and propagated it.</p>
 <p>The Oscan language, with a well-developed phonetic system and series of forms, held its own uncorrupted till its latest days. In Campania, where Capua once dared to dispute with Rome the sovereignty of Italy, arose an extensive and diversified literature, as shown by the example of the <title>ludi Atellani</title>, a kind of popular farce, which the Romans eagerly adopted, and to which they gave a peculiar form of their own.</p>
 <p>As an example of the Oscan dialect the following from the Tabula Bantina may be cited:</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">pon censtvr bansae tovtam censazet, pis cevs bantins fvst, censamvr esvf in ēitvam, poizad ligvd iosc censtvr censavm angetvzet</hi>.</p>
 <p>In Latin:</p>
 <p><quote lang="la">Cum censores Bantiae populum censebunt quis civis Bantinus erit censetor ipse et pecuniam quoia lege ii censores censere proposuerint</quote> (?)
<pb n="1148" /><cb /></p>
 <p>These few lines afford instances of the principal peculiarities of Oscan, some of which are found also in the Old Latin. Such are the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for <hi rend="italic">c (q)</hi>, the use of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> for the future sign, the ending -<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in the ablative, the ending -<hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the nominative plural of the second declension, the infinitive in -<hi rend="italic">m</hi>, etc. Other characteristic features of the language are the retention of the diphthongs in all positions (whereas the Umbrian regularly loses them), the dative and ablative plural in -<seg lang="la">ais</seg> (Gk. -<foreign lang="greek">αις</foreign>) and -<hi rend="italic">ois</hi> (Gk. -<foreign lang="greek">οις</foreign>), the locative singular in <seg lang="la">ei</seg> (Gk. -<foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign>, as in <foreign lang="greek">οἴκει</foreign>), and the genitive singular of <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-stems in -<hi rend="italic">ous (us).</hi> The vowel-system of the Oscan is the most elaborate of any of the European languages except the Greek, and the weakening of the vowels in unaccented syllables (so characteristic of the Latin) is almost unknown to it.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄσιρις</foreign>). An Egyptian god, who, with his sister and wife <ref type="cross" target="crossisis">Isis</ref> (q.v.), enjoyed in Egypt the most general worship of all the gods ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 42</bibl>). He is the male god of the fructification of the land. From him comes every blessing and all life; he gives light and health; he causes the Nile to overflow with its fertilizing waters, and all things to continue in their established order. He is always represented in human shape and with a human head, as in the annexed illustration. His hue, as that of a god who bestows life, is green; his sacred tree is the ever-green tamarisk. The Greeks identified <cb /> him with Dionysus. Originally he ruled as king over Egypt, where he introduced agriculture, morality, and the worship of the gods, until his brother Typhon (Set) contrived by deceit to shut <figure id="fig.01148.2">
<head orig="Osiris.">Osiris.</head>
</figure> him up in a chest and put him to death by pouring in molten lead. The murderer cast the chest into the Nile, which carried it into the sea. After long search the mourning Isis found the chest on the coast of Phoenicia at Byblus, and carefully concealed it. Nevertheless Typhon discovered it in the night, and cut the corpse into fourteen pieces, which he scattered in all directions. Isis, however, collected them again, and buried them in Philae or Abydus, in Upper Egypt. When Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, grew up, he took vengeance upon Typhon when, after a most obstinate struggle, he had defeated him in battle. Although Osiris lived no longer upon the earth, he was ever regarded as the source of life. In the upper world he continues to live and work by the fresh power of his youthful son Horus, and in the lower world, of which he is king, the spirits of those who are found to be just are awakened by him to new life. His hue as ruler of the lower world is black, his robes white, and his symbol an eye opened wide as a sign of his restoration to the light of day.</p>
 <p>Osiris, by his ever-renewed incarnation in the form of the black bull Apis, the symbol of generative power, assured for the Egyptians the endurance of his favour, and the consequent continuance of their life in this world and the next. In this incarnation he was called <title>Osarhapi</title> (Osiris-Apis), the origin of the Greek <ref type="cross" target="crossserapis">Serapis</ref> (q.v.) or Sarapis. The fortunes of Osiris were celebrated in magnificent annual festivals connected with mourning ceremonies, in which the Egyptians, as is observed by the ancients (e. g. Plutarch, <title>De Iside et Osiride</title>, 32, and Aelian, <title>De Nat. Animalium</title>, 10, 46), lamented in Osiris the subsidence of the Nile, the cessation of the cool north wind (whose place was taken for a time by the hot wind Typhon), the decay of vegetation, and the shortening of the length of the day. The rites of Osiris find their counterpart in those of Dionysus-Zagreus held in Crete.

This new harbour was called simply Portus Romanus or Portus Augusti, and around it there sprang up a flourishing town, also called Portus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀστρακισμός</foreign>, i. e. vote by potsherd, <foreign lang="greek">ὄστρακον</foreign>). A mode of judgment by the people practised in various Greek States (Argos, Megara, Miletus), and especially at Athens, by which persons whose presence appeared dangerous to liberty were banished for a certain period, without, however, thereby suffering any loss in reputation or property. Ostracism was introduced at Athens in B.C. 509. It was applied (among others) to Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon, and Alcibiades, and was last exercised in 417 against a demagogue, one Hyberbolus, whose insignificance made the measure ridiculous, and so brought about its abolition ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii. 73</bibl>; <title>Nicias</title>, 11, <title>Alcibiades</title>, 13). Every year the question was put to the people, whether the measure appeared necessary: if they so decided (and it was only exceptionally that there was occasion for it), the citizens who possessed the franchise assembled in the marketplace, and each wrote upon a sherd (<foreign lang="greek">ὄστρακον</foreign>) the name of the person whose banishment he deemed desirable. The man whose name was found upon not less than 6000 sherds had to leave the country in ten days at latest, for ten or (later) five years. He could, however, at any time be recalled by a decree of the people; and the question, as before, was decided by not less than 6000 votes. (See Arist. <bibl n="Aristot.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀστρακίνδα</foreign>) A game played by children in Greece, as follows: Two sets of boys stand facing one another, divided by a line drawn on the ground; a boy throws up a shell or a dish, white on one side and coloured black on the other, and each set of boys has one or other of these colours allotted to it. As he throws the shell, he calls <foreign lang="greek">νὺξ ἡμέρα</foreign>: and if the white (i. e. day) side falls uppermost, the set which represents the day pursues, and the other set runs away; if the “night” side falls uppermost, the fugitives and pursuers are reversed.

 <p>A very popular Roman poet, born March 21, B.C. 43, at Sulmo (now Solmona), in the country of the Paeligni, son of a wealthy Roman of an old equestrian family. He came at an early age to Rome, to be educated as a pleader, and enjoyed the tuition of the most famous rhetoricians of the time—Porcius Latro and Arellius Fuscus. It was not long before the instinct for poetry awoke in him with such power that it needed all his father's resolution to keep 
<pb n="1151" /><cb />
 him to his legal studies; his oratorical exercises were simply poems in prose, as is testified by one of his fellow-students—the elder Seneca (<title>Controv.</title> ii. 10, 8). After he had visited Greece and Asia to complete his education, he entered into political life at his father's desire, and filled several subordinate offices. But he soon withdrew again from public business, partly from an inclination to idleness, and lived only for poetry, in the society of the poets of his day, among whom he was especially intimate with Propertius. He came into note as a poet by a tragedy called the <title>Medea</title>, which is now lost, but is much praised by ancient literary critics; and about the same time he produced a series of amatory, and in some parts extremely licentious, poems.</p>
 <p>When little more than a mere boy, as he says himself (<title>Tristia</title>, iv. 10, 69), he had a wife given him by his father; but this marriage, like a second one, ended in a divorce. He derived more satisfaction, as well as the advantage of contact with the court and with men of the highest distinction, from a third marriage, with a widow of noble family and high connections. To her influence, perhaps, should be referred the fact that he turned his attention to more important and more serious works. He had almost completed his best known work, the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, when suddenly, in A.D. 8, he was banished for life by Augustus to Tomi (Kustindje), on the Black Sea, near the mouths of the Danube. The cause for this severity on the part of the emperor is unknown; Ovid himself admits that there was a fault on his side, but only an error, not a crime (<title>Tristia</title>, i. 3, 37). At all events, the matter directly affected Augustus; and as Ovid describes his eyes as the cause of his misfortune, it is conjectured that he had been an unintentional eye-witness of some offence on the part of the frivolous granddaughter of the prince, the younger Iulia, and had neglected to inform the emperor of the matter. His indecent amatory poems, to which he also points as the source of the emperor's displeasure, can at most only have been used as a plausible excuse in the eyes of the public, as they had been published more than ten years before. See Deville, <bibl default="NO"><title>Sur l'Exil d'Ovide</title> (Paris, 1859)</bibl>; Appal, <bibl default="NO"><title>Quibus de Causis Ovidius Relegatus Sit</title> (Leipzig, 1872)</bibl>; Körber, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Ovidii Relegationis Causis</title> (St. Petersburg, 1883)</bibl>; and Thomas in the <title>Revue de Philologie</title>, xiii. 47.</p>
 <p>After a perilous voyage Ovid reached the place of his exile in the winter of A.D. 10-11; and there, far from his beloved wife and his daughter Perilla, who had inherited the poetic talent of her father, far from his friends and all intercourse with men of genius, he had to pass the last years of his life in desolation among the barbarous Getae. Even in his exile his poetic talent did not fail him. It was then that he composed his poems of lamentation, entitled the <title>Tristia</title>, and his letters from Pontus, which afford touching proofs of his grief, though also of his failing powers. His ceaseless prayers and complaints had succeeded in softening Augustus, when the latter died. All his efforts to gain forgiveness or some alleviation of his condition met with no response from Tiberius, and he was compelled to close his life, broken-hearted and in exile, A.D. 17 or 18.</p>
 <p>His extant works are: (1) Erotic poems (<title>Amores</title>), published about B.C. 14, in five books, and again about B.C. 2, in three books. The latter edition is <cb /> the one we possess; some of its forty-nine elegies depict, in a very sensual way, the poet's life, the centre of which is the unknown Corinna, who by later writers was identified with Iulia, the daughter of Augustus (Sid. Apoll. xxiii. 159), but with no probability.</p>
 <p>(2) Letters (<title>Epistulae</title>), also called <title>Heroïdes</title>, rhetorical declamations in the form of love-letters sent by heroines to their husbands or lovers, twentyone in number; the last six of these, however, and the fourteenth, are considered spurious.</p>
 <p>(3) Methods for beautifying the face (<title>Medicamina Faciei</title>), advice to women respecting the art of the toilette; this poem has come down to us in an incomplete form.</p>
 <p>(4) The Art of Love (<title>Ars Amandi</title> or <title>Amatoria</title>), in three books, published about B.C. 2, advice to men (books i. and ii.) and women (book iii.) as to the methods of contracting a love-affair and insuring its continuance—a work as licentious as it is original and elaborate.</p>
 <p>(5) Cures for Love (<title>Remedia Amoris</title>), the pendant to the previous work, and no less offensive in substance and tone.</p>
 <p>(6) The fifteen books of the Transformations (<title>Metamorphoses</title>), his most important work. It is composed in hexameter verse; the material is borrowed from Greek and (to a less extent) from Roman sources, being a collection of legends of transformations, very skilfully combining jest and earnest in rapid alternations, and extending from chaos to the apotheosis of Caesar. When it was completed and had received the last touches, the work was cast into the flames by Ovid in his first despair at banishment, but was afterwards rewritten from other copies.</p>
 <p>(7) A Calendar of Roman Festivals (<title>Fasti</title>), begun in the last years before his banishment, and originally in twelve books, corresponding to the number of the months. Of these only six are preserved, probably because Ovid had not quite completed them at Rome, and had not the means to do so at Tomi. It was originally intended for dedication to Augustus. After Augustus's death the poet began to revise it, with a view to its dedication to Germanicus; he did not, however, proceed with his revision beyond the first book. It contains, in elegiac metre, the most important celestial phenomena and the festivals of each month, with a description of their celebration and an account of their origin according to the Italian legends.</p>
 <p>(8) Poems of Lament (<title>Tristia</title>), to his family, to his friends, and to Augustus, belonging to the years A.D. 9-13, in five books; the first of these was written while he was still on his journey to Tomi.</p>
 <p>(9) Letters from Pontus (<title>Epistulae ex Ponto</title>), in four books, only distinguished from the previous poems by their epistolary form.</p>
 <p>(10) <title>Ibis</title>, an imitation of the poem of the same name by Callimachus, who had attacked, under this name, Apollonius of Rhodes, consisting of imprecations on a faithless friend at Rome, written in the learned and obscure style of the Alexandrian poets.</p>
 <p>(11) A short fragment of a didactic poem on the fish in the Black Sea (<title>Halieutica</title>), written in hexameters. Besides these Ovid wrote, during his exile, numerous poems which have been lost, among them a eulogy of the deceased Augustus in the Getic tongue—a sufficient proof of the strength of his irrepressible love for poetry. In fact, in this respect he is distinguished above all other Roman poets. Perhaps no one ever composed with less exertion; yet at the same time no one ever used so important a faculty for so trivial a purpose. His poetry is for the 
<pb n="1152" /><cb />
 most part simply entertaining; in this kind of writing he proves his mastery by his readiness in language and metre, by his unwearied powers of invention, by his ever-ready wit, elegance, and charm, though, on the other hand, he is completely wanting in deep feeling and moral earnestness. By his talent, Ovid as well as Vergil has had great influence on the further development of Roman poetry, especially with regard to metre. Many imitated his style so closely that their poems were actually attributed to himself. Among these, besides a number of <title>Heroïdes</title> (see above), we have the <title>Nux</title>, the nut-tree's complaint of the ill-treatment it met with, a poem in elegiac verse, which was at all events written about the time of Ovid; a poem on cosmetics, <title>De Medicamine Faciei</title>, the <title>Consolatio ad Liviam</title> on the death of Drusus; and a number of jointed skits such as the <title>De Pulice, De Vetula</title>, various Priapeia, etc.</p>

It was partitioned off with a railing, and from it the voters passed out over a bridge or gangway (<seg lang="la">pons suffragiorum</seg>) to throw their ballots (<seg lang="la">tabellae</seg>) into the voting basket (<seg lang="la">cista</seg>).

<head orig="Oxus">Oxus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄξος</foreign>). The Jihoun or Amou. A great river of Central Asia, forming the boundary between Sogdiana on the north and Bactria and Margiana on the south, and falling into the Caspian. The Jihoun now flows into the southwestern corner of the Sea of Aral; but there are still distinct traces of a channel in a southwesterly direction from the Sea of Aral to the Caspian, by which at least a portion, and probably the whole, of the waters of the Oxus found their way into the Caspian. The Oxus occupies an important place in history, having been in nearly all ages the extreme boundary between the great monarchies of southwestern Asia and the hordes which wander over the central steppes. Herodotus does not mention the Oxus by name, but it is supposed to be the river which he calls Araxes.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
<note id="ref3" target="n3">The power of the quaestors to fine is disputed by Mommsen. But even curatores could fine. (See Karlowa, Rechtsgeschichte, p. 171.)</note>
