 <p> An emperor of the East A.D. 364-378, born about A.D. 328, and made emperor by his brother Valentinian. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvalentinianus">Valentinianus</ref>.) The greater part of Valens's reign was occupied by his

 wars with the Goths. At first he gained great advantages over the barbarians, and concluded a peace with them in 370, on the condition that they should not cross the Danube. In 376 the Goths were driven out of their country by the Huns, and were allowed by Valens to cross the Danube and settle in Thrace and the country on the borders of the Danube. Dissensions soon arose between the Romans and these dangerous neighbors, and in 377 the Goths took up arms under Fritigern. Valens collected a powerful army, and marched against the Goths, but he was defeated by them with immense slaughter, near Adrianople, on the 9th of August, 378. Valens was never seen after the battle: some say he died on the field; and others relate that he was burned to death in a peasant's house, to which he was carried, and which the barbarians set fire to without knowing who was in it (Amm. Marc. xxxi. 13). The reign of Valens is important in the history of the Empire on account of the admission of the Goths into the countries south of the Danube—the commencement of the decline of the Roman power. Furious contests between the rival creeds of the Catholics and the Arians also characterize this reign.

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossfabius">Fabius</ref>. One of the principal generals of the emperor Vitellius. In A.D. 69 he marched into Italy through Gaul, and, after forming a junction with the forces of Caecina, defeated Otho in the decisive battle of Bedriacum, which secured for Vitellius the sovereignty of Italy. Vitellius raised Valens and Caecina to the consulship, and left the whole government in their hands. Valens remained faithful to Vitellius when Antonius Primus, the general of Vespasian, marched into Italy; but as he had not sufficient force to oppose Antonius after the capture of Cremona, he resolved to sail to Gaul and rouse the Gallic provinces to support the cause of Vitellius. He was taken prisoner at the islands of the Stoechades (Hyères), off Massilia, and was shortly afterwards put to death at Urbinum (Urbino) ( <bibl n="Sal.

<head orig="Valentiniānus">Valentinianus</head>

 <p> (1) A Roman emperor (A.D. 364- 375), was the son of Gratianus, and was born A.D. 321, at Cibalis in Pannonia. His first wife was Valeria Severa, by whom he became the father of the emperor Gratianus. He held important military commands under Julian and Jovian; and on the death of the latter, in February, 364, Valentinian was elected emperor by the troops at Nicaea. A few weeks after his elevation Valentinian, by the desire of the soldiers, associated in the empire his brother Valens, and assigned to him the East, while he himself undertook the government of the West. Valentinian was a Catholic, though his brother Valens was an Arian; but he did not persecute either Arians or heathens. He possessed good abilities, prudence, and vigour of character. <cb /> He had a capacity for military matters, and was a vigilant, impartial, and laborious administrator. The greater part of Valentinian's reign was occupied by the wars against the Alemanni and the other barbarians on the Roman frontier, in which his operations were attended with success. He not only drove the Alemanni out of Gaul, but on more than one occasion crossed the Rhine, and carried the war into the enemy's country. His usual residence was Treviri (Trèves). In 375 he went to Carnuntum on the Danube, in order to repel the Quadi and Sarmatians, who had invaded Pannonia. After an indecisive campaign he took up his winter-quarters at Bregetio. In this place, while giving an audience to the deputies of the Quadi, and speaking with great heat, he fell down in a fit and expired suddenly, on the 17th of November (Amm. Marc. xxviii.-xxx.; Zosim. iv. 17).
 </p>
 <p>(2) A Roman emperor (A.D. 375-392), younger son of the preceding, proclaimed Augustus by the army after his father's death, though he was then only four or five years of age. His elder brother Gratianus, who had been proclaimed Augustus during the lifetime of their father, assented to the choice of the army, and a division of the West was made between the two brothers. Valentinian had Italy, Illyricum, and Africa; Gratian had the Gauls, Spain, and Britain. In 383 Gratian was defeated and slain by Maximus, who left Valentinian a precarious authority out of fear for Theodosius, the emperor of the East; but in 387 Valentinian was expelled from Italy by Maximus, and fled for refuge to Theodosius. In 388 Theodosius defeated Maximus, and restored Valentinian to his authority as emperor of the West. Theodosius returned to Constantinople in 391; and in the following year (392) Valentinian was murdered by the general Arbogastes, who raised Eugenius to the throne. Valentinian perished on the 15th of May, being only a few months above twenty years of age. His funeral oration was pronounced by St. Ambrose.
 </p>
 <p>(3) Roman emperor A.D. 426-455, was born 419, and was the son of Constantius III. by Placidia, the sister of Honorius and the daughter of Theodosius I. He was declared Augustus in 425 by Theodosius II., and was placed over the West, but as he was only six years of age the government was intrusted to his mother Placidia. During his long reign the Empire was repeatedly exposed to the invasions of the barbarians; and it was only the military abilities of Aëtius which saved the Empire from ruin. In 429 the Vandals under Genseric crossed over into Africa, which they conquered, and of which they continued in possession till the reign of Justinian. The weakness of the Empire during this reign was shown also by the fact that the Britons (from whose country the Roman troops had been withdrawn forty years before), finding it vain to apply to Rome for aid against the incursions of the Picts, invited the Jutes under Hengest and Horsa to help them, in 449. The Goths likewise established themselves in Gaul; but Aëtius finally made peace with them (439), and with their assistance gained a great victory over Attila and the vast army of the Huns at Châlons in 451. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossattila">Attila</ref>.) The power and influence of Aëtius excited the jealousy and fears of Valentinian, who murdered his faithful general in 454. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaetius">Aëtius</ref>.) In the following year the emperor himself was slain by Petronius Maximus, whose wife he had violated.

 <p> One of the most ancient patrician houses at Rome. It was of Sabine origin, and the founder, Volesus or Volusus, is said to have settled at Rome with Titus Tatius. One of the descendants of this Volesus, P. Valerius, afterwards surnamed Publicola, plays a distinguished part in the story of the expulsion of the kings, and was elected consul in the first year of the Republic, B.C. 509. From this time down to the latest period of the Empire, for nearly 1000 years, the name occurs more or less frequently in the Fasti, and it was borne by several of the emperors. The Valeria gens enjoyed extraordinary honours and privileges at Rome. In early times they were always foremost in advocating the rights of the plebeians, and the laws which they proposed were the great charters of the liberties of the second order. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex</ref>.) The Valeria gens was divided into various families under the Republic, the most important of which bore the name of <ref type="cross" target="crosscorvus">Corvus</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossflaccus">Flaccus</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossmessala">Messala</ref>, and <ref type="cross" target="crosspublicola">Publicola</ref>.

 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossmaximus">Maxĭmus</ref>, a Roman historian. Of his life we know only that he accompanied the proconsul Sextus Pompeius to Asia in A.D. 27 (ii. 6, 8). On his return he composed, between A.D. 29 and 32, a collection of historical anecdotes in nine books, <title>Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium Libri</title>, which he dedicated to the emperor Tiberius. The book consists of an uncritical collection of extracts taken mostly from Livy and Cicero, but also from Sallust and Pompeius Trogus. These are divided into domestic and foreign instances under different headings, mostly descriptive of moral qualities, sometimes grouped according to subjects and sometimes not. The style is bad, and full of rhetorical declamation; the character of the compiler reveals itself in his gross flattery of Tiberius. Nevertheless, owing to the convenient selection of anecdotes which the book offered to orators and authors, it was much quoted in the succeeding generations down to the Middle Ages. It has come down to us with two epitomes, drawn up in late Roman times, by Iulius Paris and <cb /> Ianuarius Nepotianus. The short dissertation <title>De Praenominibus</title>, appended to the work, has nothing to do with Valerius himself. It is an epitome drawn up by the above-mentioned Paris from the first portion of a work on Roman names by an unknown writer, who quotes old authorities on the subject, especially Varro. There are good texteditions of Valerius Maximus by Halm <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1865)</bibl> and Kempf <bibl default="NO">(2d ed.

 <p>A celebrated Italian scholar of the period of the Renaissance. He was born at Rome in 1405, and studied at Florence, where, as also at Pavia, he taught the classics. His life was one of a vagrant indolence, interspersed by violent controversies with contemporary scholars; yet he was a remarkably gifted man, and his Latin style has always been justly admired. He edited and translated Herodotus, Xenophon, and Thucydides, and wrote a sort of manual of Latin usage (<title>Elegantiae Linguae Latinae</title>), which had an immense

 success and did much to expel the barbarisms of mediaeval Latinity from the speech and the writings of the learned.

 <p>A celebrated Roman poet whose poetical career began in the later days of the Republic. Like his younger friend Vergil, he was much honoured and appreciated by Augustus and Maecenas, to whom he also introduced his friend Horace. Vergil, at his death, in B.C. 19, left him and Plotius Tucca his literary remains, and Augustus intrusted to them the revision and publication. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvergilius-maro">Vergilius</ref>.) He died before the year B.C. 12. At the opening of the Augustan era he was the most conspicuous of the Latin epic poets; but he obtained his greatest reputation by his tragedy <title>Thyestes</title>, which, with the <title>Medea</title> of Ovid, was considered the greatest effort of Roman literature in this department. The work was brought out at the games held in honour of the victory at Actium B.C. 29, and was rewarded by Augustus with an honorarium of a million sesterces ($40,000). Of this, as of his epic poems (on the death of Caesar and panegyric on Augustus), only a few verses survive.

 <p>(1) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius"> Gaius,</ref> consul B.C. 216 with L. Aemilius Paulus. Varro is said to have been the son of a butcher, to have carried on business himself as a factor in his early years, and to have risen to eminence by pleading the causes of the lower classes against the opposition of the nobility (<bibl n="Liv.  22. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxii. 25</bibl>; Val. Max. iii. 4, 4). Notwithstanding the strong influence of the aristocracy, he was raised to the consulship by the people, who thought that it only needed a man of energy at the head of an overwhelming force to bring the war against Hannibal to a close, and who, moreover, had an excessive mistrust of the aims and motives of the Senate. His colleague was L. Aemilius Paulus, one of the leaders of the aristocratic party. The two consuls were defeated by Hannibal at the memorable battle of Cannae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshannibal">Hannibal</ref>.) The battle was fought by Varro against the advice of Paulus. The Roman army was all but annihilated. Paulus and almost all the officers perished. Varro was one of the few who escaped and reached Venusia in safety, with about seventy horsemen. His conduct after the battle seems to have deserved praise. He proceeded to Canusium, where the remnant of the Roman army had taken refuge, and there adopted every precaution which the exigencies of the case required. His defeat was forgotten in the services he had lately rendered. On his return to the city all classes went 
<pb n="1634" /><cb />
 out to meet him, and the Senate returned him thanks because he had not despaired of the commonwealth. This marked the determination of patricians and plebeians to work heartily together against the foreign enemy (<bibl n="Liv.  22. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxii. 35</bibl>-61; Polyb. iii. 106-116;  <bibl n="Plut.

Varro continued to be employed in Italy for several successive years in important military commands till nearly the close of the Punic War.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Terentius Varro Reatīnus</hi>, a celebrated writer, whose vast and varied erudition in almost every department of literature earned for him the title of the “most learned of the Romans” ( <bibl n="Quint.  10. i. 95" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. i. 95</bibl>; <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 21" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 21</bibl>; <title>C. D.</title> vi. 2). He was born at Reaté B.C. 116, and was trained under L. Aelius Stilo Praeconinus, and afterwards by Antiochus, a philosopher of the Academy. Varro held a high naval command in the wars against the pirates and Mithridates, and afterwards served as the <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> of Pompeius in Spain in the Civil War, but was compelled to surrender his forces to Caesar ( <bibl n="Flor.  2. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.ii. 13</bibl><bibl n="Flor.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor., 29</bibl>; <title>B.C.</title> i. 38, ii. 17-20). He then passed over into Greece, and shared the fortunes of the Pompeian party till after the battle of Pharsalia, when he obtained the forgiveness of Caesar, who employed him in superintending the collection and arrangement of the great library designed for public use ( <title>Iul.</title> 44;  <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 6. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>vi. 5</bibl>). For some years after this period Varro remained in literary seclusion, passing his time chiefly at his country seats near Cumae and Tusculum, occupied with study and composition. Caesar had forced Antony to restore to Varro an estate which he had seized ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>ii. 40</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 103" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Phil., 103</bibl>), and, perhaps in consequence, upon the formation of the Second Triumvirate his name appeared upon the list of the proscribed; but he succeeded in making his escape, and, after having remained for some time concealed, he obtained the protection of Octavian. His life is said to have been saved by Fufius Calenus ( <title>B. C.</title> iv. 47), and it is probable that he recovered a great portion of his estates; but most of his magnificent library had been destroyed ( <bibl n="Gel.  3. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 10</bibl>). The remainder of his career was passed in tranquillity, and he continued to labour in his favourite studies. His death took place B.C. 28, when he was in his eighty-ninth year.</p>
 <p>Not only was Varro the most learned of Roman scholars, but he was likewise the most voluminous of Roman authors. Gellius (l. c.) states that Varro claimed to have written 490 books before he was seventy-seven: Ausonius gives in round numbers 600 as the total number of books written by Varro (<title>Prof. Burd.</title> xx. 10); and this agrees with a list given by St. Jerome which makes out the writings of Varro to consist of seventy-four different works, containing altogether 620 books. (Cf. also Augustin. <title>De Civ. Dei</title>, vi. 2; and <title>Acad.</title> i. 9.) Hence it would appear that 130 of the books were written in the last twelve years of his life. Of these works only two have survived: <title>(a) De Re Rustica Libri III</title>, still extant, written when the author was eighty years old, and the most important of all the treatises upon ancient agriculture now extant, being far superior to the more voluminous production of Columella, with which alone it can be compared. It is edited by Keil (Halle, 1884 foll.), and in the <title>Scriptores Rei Rusticae Veteres Latini</title>, by Schneider <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1764-1797)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>De Lingua Latina</title>, a grammatical treatise which extended to twentyfour books; but six only (v.-x.) have been preserved, <cb /> and these in a mutilated condition. The remains of this treatise are particularly valuable, since they have been the means of preserving many terms and forms which would otherwise have been altogether lost, and much curious information is here treasured up connected with the ancient usages, both civil and religious, of the Romans. Editions by Spengel <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1826, reëdited 1885)</bibl>; in Didot's collection <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1875)</bibl>; and by O. Müller <bibl default="NO">(last ed. Leipzig, 1883)</bibl>. The remains of Varro's other grammatical treatises are discussed by Wilmanns <bibl default="NO">(1864)</bibl>. The work entitled <title>Antiquitatum Libri</title> was divided into two sections: <title>Antiquitates Rerum Humanarum</title>, in twenty-five books, and <title>Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum</title>, in sixteen books. It described the political and religious institutions of Rome, and was Varro's greatest work, upon which chiefly his reputation for profound learning was based; but unfortunately only a few fragments of it have come down to us, printed in Merkel's edition of Ovid's <title>Fasti</title>, pp. cvi.-ccxlvii. <bibl default="NO">(1841)</bibl>. With the second section of the work we are, comparatively speaking, familiar, since St. Augustine drew very largely from this source in his <title>De Civitate Dei.</title></p>
 <p>Varro wrote also a collection of biographies called <title>Imagines</title> or <title>Hebdomades</title> in fifteen books, which contain 700 lives or sketches of famous Greeks and Romans, arranged in groups of seven. It is said to have been illustrated with portraits and afterwards to have appeared in a cheaper edition without pictures. Another work, <title>Disciplinae</title>, in nine books, described the “liberal arts,” viz., grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astrology, music, medicine, and architecture (see <ref type="cross" target="crossliberales-artes">Liberales Artes</ref>); and he wrote other works on philosophy (<title>Logistorici</title> in seventy-six books), geography, and law. Among his poetical works were the <title>Saturae</title>, which were composed in a variety of metres and with an admixture of prose. Varro in these pieces copied to a certain extent the productions of Menippus the Gadarene (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmenippus">Menippus</ref>), and hence designated them as <title>Saturae Menippeae s. Cynicae.</title> They appear to have been a series of disquisitions on a vast variety of subjects, frequently, if not uniformly, couched in the shape of dialogue, the object proposed being the inculcation of moral lessons and serious truths in a familiar, playful, and even jocular style. The best editions of the fragments of these <title>Saturae</title> are by Riese <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1865)</bibl>, and Bücheler (with Petronius) <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1882)</bibl>. The <title>Sententiae Varronis</title>, a collection of pithy sayings, may possibly have been gathered from the writings of Varro Reatinus, but this is wholly uncertain. They are edited by Devit <bibl default="NO">(Padua, 1843)</bibl>. See Boissier, <bibl default="NO"><title>Études sur M. T. Varron</title> (Paris, 1861)</bibl>; and Ritschl, <title>Die Schriftstellerei des Varro</title> in his <title>Opuscula</title>, iii. 419-505; id. <title>Parerga</title>, pp. 70 foll.

 <p>A Roman consul B.C. 13, and subsequently appointed to the government of Syria, where he acquired enormous wealth. Shortly after his return from Syria he was made governor of Germany (probably about A.D. 7), and was instructed by Augustus to introduce the Roman jurisdiction into that newly conquered country. The Germans, however, were not prepared to submit thus tamely to the Roman yoke, and found a leader in Arminius, a noble chief of the Cherusci, who organized a general revolt of all the German tribes between the Visurgis and the Weser. When he had fully matured his plans, he suddenly attacked Varus, at the head of a countless host of barbarians, as the Roman general was marching with his three legions through a pass of the Saltus Teutoburgiensis, a range of hills covered with wood, which extends north of the Lippe from Osnabrück to Paderborn, and is known in the present day by the name of the Teutoburgerwald or Lippische Wald. The battle lasted three days, and ended with the entire destruction of the Roman army. Varus put an end to his own life. His defeat was followed by the loss of all the Roman possessions between the Weser and the Rhine, and the latter river again became the boundary of the Roman dominions. When the news of this defeat reached Rome, the whole city was thrown into consternation; and Augustus, who was both weak and aged, gave way to the most violent grief, tearing his garments and calling upon Varus to give him back his legions—“Vare, Vare, redde legiones!” ( <bibl n="Suet.

<head orig="Vas">Vas</head>

 <p> A vase; in the plural (<seg lang="la">vasa</seg>) a generic term for earthenware. In a technical sense it is also applied to the baggage of a Roman army in the field.</p>
 <p>The shaping of baked clay into vessels was probably suggested and influenced by the use of gourds as vessels in primitive times; and the gourd-shape is that which predominates in the forms of Greek and Roman pottery. The earliest known types of Greek ceramic art are represented in the pottery exhumed by Schliemann at Hassarlik. This is rude in construction and clumsy in design, and in general <cb /> falls under two classes—the first being shown in the two-handled vase represented below, and the so-called “owl-vase” exhibited in the second illustration. The first was identified by Schliemann with the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον</foreign>, and the second has an interest of its own in being a <figure id="fig.01635">
<head orig="Two-handled Vase from Hassarlik. (Schliemann.)">Two-handled Vase from Hassarlik. (Schliemann.)</head>
</figure> primitive attempt to give to a vase some of the attributes of a living model. These vases are made by hand, and have the dull, blackish colour produced by the smoke of the furnace. <figure id="fig.01635.2">
<head orig="Owl-vase from Hissarlik. (Schliemann.)">Two-handled Vase from Hassarlik. (Schliemann.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>A more advanced type is found in the vases derived from the groves of Cyprus, especially at Alambra (Dali) and Larnaca (Kition), places colonized by the Phoenicians. These Cypriote vases are either (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) covered with a vitreous slip and baked to some shade of red, and occasionally decorated with slips of clay often in the shape of serpents; and (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) of fine clay delicately moulded, in colour gray or pale black. In shape they are either long and 
<pb n="1636" /><cb />
 gourdlike or flat and broad like a shallow cup. Vases of the same general type have been found also on several of the Aegean Islands, such as Amorgos, Antiparos, Naxos, and Melos. Painted vases gave a new direction to the taste and ingenuity of the potter; and many such have been found at Thera (Santorin) whose ware is made entirely by the wheel, and are furnished with a foot so as to stand by themselves and not to be hung by a handle. In these, red, brown-black, and white are used on prepared grounds of gray, buff, and brownish red. It has been asserted by some, on the evidence of geology, that this ware dates back to the fifteenth or even to the twentieth century before Christ.</p>
 <p>The next stage of development is represented by the “Mycenaean” ware, found, however, in many localities. It consists of vases painted either with opaque or with lustrous colours (violet-brown, red, or white) upon red or pale clay, and the ornamentation is derived largely from marine forms. A few specimens of early vases imitate in clay the Phoenician glass, painted in wavy lines of orange on red and highly polished. In both the Alambra and Mycenaean pottery are seen the beginnings of a new style of decoration known as the “geometric,” influenced by the technique of metal-work, and exhibiting the ornamental designs of concentric arches, rosettes, spirals, etc. The finest specimens of this style after it is fully established come from Athens, which is regarded as the principal seat of its manufacture. The geometric style became the most popular of all, and it gave the artist sureness of hand and eye, and a sense of form and proportion that was very valuable.</p>
 <p>A new feature is exemplified in vases found at Phalerum which employ new animal types, designed and grouped under the influence of Oriental models. A development of this style combined with the geometric is called by Conze the “Melian.” From the production of this pottery, Oriental influence increases and adds much to the beauty and effectiveness of the painted vase.</p>
 <p>Under the further influence of metal-work and embroidery, polychromy enters fully into the methods of the vase-painter. Light and shade, and discrimination of planes of surface, were made possible by the combination of silhouette and outline-drawing introduced by the potters of the island of Rhodes. The subjects chosen by this school are chiefly animals (goats, lions, bulls, boars, rams), and, later, the human figure. Adefinite scene (from the Epic) is first found depicted in clay on the Euphorbus Pinax, assigned by Kirchhoff to the seventh century B.C., and depicting the battle of Menelaüs and Hector over the body of Euphorbus. The polychromatic school reached its highest development at Naucratis. The Oriental style is found in its perfection in the ware of Corinth, which is crowded with ornament, so that at a little distance the separate figures cannot be distinguished, but the general effect is that of a rich Oriental brocade. Scenes from mythology and also from ordinary life now appear. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdodwell-vase">Dodwell Vase</ref>.) This growing sense that human action is the true subject for the vase-painter's art led to the decline of Orientalism, which held to animals. After this change was thoroughly established, the great centre of fictile production was Athens (cir. 650-300 B.C.). <cb /> <figure id="fig.01636">

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Athenian</hi> pottery has two epochs—the “blackfigure” and the “red-figure.” A new discovery contributed to the rapid advance of Athenian ceramics—a deep-black varnish of the highest brilliancy, with a surface like polished metal, insensible to ordinary reagents, but not interfering with that porousness of the clay which under a Greek sun is so necessary for the coolness of water or wine. Its manufacture is still a secret; nor is it known where the invention first saw the light. So popular did it immediately become that the vase-painter covered the whole surface with it, leaving as field for the actual picture only a square panel of red ground-colour.</p>
 <p>It is with the masters of black-figure style that the point first comes adequately to express the lines of musculature and bodily form. The rendering of drapery is a mark of relative date. At first the <hi rend="italic">chiton</hi> is a straight daub of colour, as in Corinthian ware, and is often purple in hue with perhaps a black girdle; then patterns are scratched in, or elaborately painted on with white; folds begin to be marked, are outlined with the point, and dress gives some hint of the underlying contour of the body. An alternate use of purple and black for the folds is occasionally carried so far as to express light and shade. A like use of purple is to be seen in the treatment of muscles in animals, especially the horse. White is throughout a flesh-tint for female figures, but is also employed, on later vases, for the long <hi rend="italic">chiton</hi> of a charioteer and the gray hair of old men.</p>
 <p>Drawing is almost entirely in profile; full-face is rendered with little more adroitness than had been shown before. The eyes of men remain large and round; of women, oval and small. In more recent vases a trick grows up of crowding the field with long, purely conventional ivy sprays: equally conventional in rendering are the landscape features sometimes introduced, and no attempt is made at pictorial perspective.</p>
 <p>The subjects of vases become now of less importance for their general history. In black-figure ware they are mainly mythological, sometimes <seg lang="la">genre.</seg> In mythology, the Dionysiac cycle and the 
<pb n="1637" /><cb />
 feats of Heracles are by far most frequent; after them, the legends of Athené and Hermes. Frequently as scenes from the Cyclic poets appear, scarcely any can be traced to the <title>Iliad</title> or <title>Odyssey.</title></p>
 <p>Ornament, as distinct from painted scenes, becomes stereotyped. Signed vases are now in vogue, and the <hi rend="italic">cylices</hi> are especially fruitful in artists' signatures which have preserved their names. Ergotimos and Clitias, who made and painted the great François <hi rend="italic">crater</hi>, were followed by Nearchus, whose sons Tleson and Ergoteles, with Ergotimos's son Euchirus, have signed many of the earlier <hi rend="italic">cylices.</hi> Other names are Xenocles, Hermogenes, Archicles. In <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg> Exekias takes first place for spirited and careful drawing; Amasis carries nicety of detail almost to extravagance; Hischylos represents transition style. The most prolific and clever, as also the most popular, was Nicosthenes, who originated a new <hi rend="italic">cylix</hi>, and is also known by a peculiar form of <seg lang="la">amphora</seg> introduced by him. On Nicosthenes, see Löschcke in the <title>Archäolog. Zeitung</title> for 1881, pp. 33 foll.</p>
 <p>It is not known precisely where the making of red-figure ware originated; but its origin is assigned approximately to the year B.C. 500, and is said to have owed its development to high art. Hitherto, the ceramic art of the Greeks had been properly classed as “ornament”; hereafter it became a branch of painting. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspictura">Pictura</ref>.) It shows a great advance in drawing and is free from the conventionalism of the black-figure ware. In its development the influence of Polygnotus was very great. Contemporary with the red-figure vases is the polychromatic ware with a white ground. The great majority of this class are <hi rend="italic">lekythi</hi>, though these are found also in red-figure.</p>
 <p>Three classes of <hi rend="italic">lekythi</hi> may be distinguished: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Figures generally in red or sienna; subjects entirely funereal; polychromy sober and restrained; style, fine. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Figures in black or brown; subjects generally funereal, but sometimes drawn from family life, the pantheon, or even mythology; polychromy brilliant and often directly pictorial; style fine. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Figures in yellow; painting almost always monochrome; style decadent, often careless. Still another type of ware is represented by vases simply covered with a lustrous black varnish, ornamented after the fourth century B.C. with gilding and an occasional figure in colours. Many are of great beauty. Vases in the shape of human heads and <hi rend="italic">rhyta</hi> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossrhyton">Rhyton</ref>) and others of terra-cotta modelled in the form of human busts are found.</p>
 <p>From about the time of Alexander the Great (B.C. 325), the manufacture of red-figured vases was transferred to Italy, where there have always existed native schools of pottery. With the opening of the Hellenistic as opposed to the Hellenic Age, art became provincial. Sculpture and painting passed to Pergamum, Alexandria, and Rhodes, and in like manner pottery was chiefly cultivated in the cities of Magna Graecia.</p>
 <p>No new world-wide trade, like that of Athens, no important novelty in technique, marked the transference. Although Apulia produced <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg> and <hi rend="italic">crateres</hi> of great splendour, the decadence of style, which had already begun at Athens, is painfully apparent. Men sought to add fresh life to a waning industry by inventing giant vases and richer shapes, by bringing into play all the resources of polychromy, and even summoning plastic to their aid; but profuse ornament and gaudy <cb /> colouring scarcely cloak bad drawing and bad taste. Yet the artists had a pride in their work, and signatures again occur, though in no great number. Two traits are characteristic: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The strict relation maintained on most examples between the use of the vase for service at the tomb and its decoration (either a scene of offerings at the tomb, or an appropriate myth); and—where the subject is not funereal— (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the frequent borrowing from the stage (farces especially), and the rendering of other than dramatic scenes with dramatic accessories (cf. Heydemann, <title>Jahrbuch</title>, 1886, pp. 260 foll.).</p>
 <p>Three separate South Italian fabrics may be distinguished, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucanian, Campanian, Apulian</hi>. The technique in all is that of red-figure ware. Each class exhibits a peculiarity in depicting the human figure, a peculiarity suggestive of difference of social type; each, too, introduces details of national costume.</p>
 <p>Lucanian vases may be relatively somewhat older; at least their manufacture seems to have sooner come to an end. Though somewhat helpless in draughtmanship, their style is comparatively restrained; polychromy is little used, and the heavy, clumsy drapery seldom bears a trace of ornament. A favourite shape is the campaniform crater; another, a kind of amphora only found in Lucania:</p>
 <p>Later examples show great fondness for polychromy, tints especially prominent being white and yellow—the latter, in most cases, a cheap substitute for gilding. Tendrils of vine, ivy, and other plants are often introduced, as also on Apulian ware, with a happy effect; and occasionally motifs are taken direct from nature, as, for instance, a bird singing on a spray. The most important class, and that of highest artistic merit, is the Apulian, a product probably of Tarentine activity. Characteristic are the giant <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg>, one blaze of ornament from head to foot; characteristic, too, the heavy Doric chin of the men, the slender neck and stout barrel of the horses, the zones of fishes and marine forms employed as ornament.</p>
 <p>As regards colours in South Italian polychrome ware, the red ground-clay is often changed to brown, and white used as a flesh-tint for women, but also, with a dash of yellow, for men. Yellow is perhaps the favourite decorative colour. The South Italian (Greek) vase-making died out about B.C. 250, at which time <ref type="cross" target="crosslatin">Latin</ref> painted vases begin to appear. Their ornamentation is quite simple and rude—a spray of vine or olive with perhaps an Eros in the centre (<bibl default="NO"><title>Annali dell' Inst.</title> 1884</bibl>). These are the last painted vases, and they are immediately succeeded by the Cales ware, black, metallic, and moulded (Gamurrini, <title>Gazette Archéol.</title> for 1879, pp. 47 foll.). Henceforth pottery, for so much life as is left to it, became a branch of plastic. On the Calene style followed the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Samian</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aretine</hi>. Greek ceramic art had given place to Roman. The pottery of <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Rome</ref> is in itself of less importance, and is noted under <ref type="cross" target="crossfictile">Fictilé;</ref> but it has a value of its own, as the link by which the secrets of classical ceramic art were communicated to the Northern nations, among whom the Kelts rank first. Samian and Aretine vases were freely imitated in Gaul and England, where native fabrics grew up under Roman influence.</p>

<head orig="Vectigalia">Vectigalia</head>

 <p> A Roman term originally denoting only the revenues flowing into the State chest from the State domains, and for the most part collected by contract. The domains consisted of cultivated grounds, the rent of which was paid in money or kind; of pastures and meadows, for the use of which a payment (<seg lang="la">scriptura</seg>) was made (see <ref type="cross" target="crossscriptura">Scriptura</ref>); of forests, from which revenue was derived mainly by the letting of pitch huts; of lakes and rivers let for fishing; and of mines and salt-works. With a view to protecting the citizens from exorbitant prices, the sale of salt had already been made a State monopoly in the earliest years of the Republic, and it remained such till late into the times of the Empire. In letting salt mines the price of the salt was fixed in the contract, as was also the case with many articles produced from mines (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmetallum">Metallum</ref>). The term <seg lang="la">vectigal</seg> also includes the rent paid for buildings, shops, booths, and baths erected on public sites; the payment for the use of bridges and roads, of public water-ways, and sewers in cases where private properties drained into them; export and import tolls (see <ref type="cross" target="crossportorium">Portorium</ref>), as well as all other indirect taxes. Such was the tax which was introduced into Rome in B.C. 357, and under the emperors was levied throughout the whole Empire, the <seg lang="la">vicesima libertatis</seg> or <seg lang="la">manumissionis;</seg> a tax of five per cent. paid on every manumitted slave, either by himself or his master (see <ref type="cross" target="crossservus">Servus</ref>). To these were added under Augustus the <seg lang="la">centesima rerum venalium</seg>, a tax of one per cent. on all articles sold at auctions; the <seg lang="la">quinta et vicesima mancipiorum</seg>, a tax of four per cent. on every slave sold; and the <seg lang="la">vicesima hereditatum et legatorum</seg>, a tax of five per cent. on all inheritances over 100,000 sesterces ($4000), and on all legacies not falling to the next of kin. This impost, with the increase of celibacy and the custom of leaving complimentary legacies to the whole circle of one's friends, proved exceedingly productive, and, though originally limited to Roman citizens, was, with the franchise, extended by Caracalla to all the inhabitants of the Empire, and at the same time raised to ten per cent. Plutarch states ( <bibl n="D. H. Pomp. 45" default="NO"> <title>Pomp.</title>45</bibl>) that before Pompey's earlier conquests the vectigalia of the Roman State amounted to the annual sum of

 <p>The author of a treatise, <title>Rei Militaris Instituta</title>, or <title>Epitoma Rei Militaris.</title> The exact date is not established, but it was probably composed early in the fifth century A.D. It is a question whether its dedication to Theodosius is genuine, and some writers maintain that it was addressed to Valentinian III. The materials were derived, according to the declaration of the writer himself, from Cato the Censor <title>De Disciplina Militari</title>, from Cornelius Celsus, from Frontinus, from Paternus, and from the imperial constitutions of Augustus, Trajan, and Hadrian. The work is divided into four books. The first treats of the levying and training of recruits, including instructions for the fortification of a camp; the second, of the different classes into which soldiers are divided, and especially of the organization of the legion; the third, of the operations of an army in the field; the fourth, of the attack and defence of fortresses, and of marine warfare. Another division makes the number of books five, the fifth being the part relating to marine warfare. The value of this work, which is a somewhat uncritical compilation from different historians, is much diminished by the fact that the usages of periods the most remote from each other are mixed together into one confused mass, and not unfrequently, we have reason to suspect, are blended with arrangements which never existed except in the fancy of the author. It is probably right to ascribe to the same Vegetius the work on veterinary art called <title>Mulomedicina</title> (on the treatment of horses and mules), though it is written in a more popular style, as being intended for the use of less refined readers. The military work is edited by Oudendorp and Bessel <bibl default="NO">(Strasburg, 1806)</bibl>; and the <title>Res Militaris</title> by Lang <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1885)</bibl>.

 <p> Now Isola Farnese; one of the most ancient and powerful cities of Etruria, situated on the river Cremera, about twelve miles from Rome. <cb /> It was one of the twelve cities of the Etruscan Confederation, and apparently the largest of all. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossetruria">Etruria</ref>.) So far as we can judge from its present remains, it was about seven miles in circumference, which agrees with the statement of Dionysius that it was equal in size to Athens. Its territory (Ager Veiens) was extensive, and appears originally to have extended on the south and east to the Tiber; on the southwest to the sea, embracing the <seg lang="la">salinae</seg> or salt-works at the mouth of the river; and on the west to the territory of Caeré. The Ciminian forest appears to have been its northwestern boundary; on the east it must have embraced all the district south of Soracté and eastward to the Tiber. The cities of Capena and Fidenae were colonies of Veii. The Veientes were engaged in almost unceasing hostilities with Rome for more than three centuries and a half, and we have records of fourteen distinct wars between the two peoples. Veii was at length taken by the dictator Camillus, after a siege which is said to have lasted ten years. From this time Veii was abandoned; but after the lapse of ages it was colonized afresh by Augustus, and made a Roman municipium. The new colony, however, occupied scarcely a third of the ancient city, and had again sunk into decay in the reign of Hadrian.

<head orig="Veiŏvis">Veiovis</head>

 <p> (also <hi rend="bold">Vediŏvis</hi>). An old Italian deity whose peculiar attributes were early forgotten. At Rome he had a famous shrine in the depression between the two peaks of the Capitoline Hill, the Capitol and the Arx (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 3. 430" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>iii. 430</bibl>; <bibl n="Gel.  5. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.v. 12</bibl>). There lay his asylum and afterwards his temple between two sacred groves. His statue, by the side of which stood a goat as a symbol, had a youthful, beardless head, and carried a bundle of arrows in its right hand; it was therefore supposed that he was the same as the Greek Apollo. Others saw in him a youthful Inpiter; while at a later date he was identified with Dis, the god of the world below. He was probably a god of expiation, and hence at the same time the protector of runaway criminals. The goat, which was sacrificed to him annually on the 7th of March, appears elsewhere in the Roman cult as an expiatory sacrifice. Etymologists differ as to the composition of the name Veiovis. Some regard the prefix <seg lang="la">ve</seg>as diminutive, hence “little Iupiter” (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 3. 445" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>iii. 445</bibl>) <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1." default="NO" valid="yes"> Fast., i.</bibl> e. youthful. Others make it intensive, as in <seg lang="la">vepallidus</seg>, and hence interpret “mighty” or “destructive” Iupiter. It is probably separative and negative in its nature, as in <seg lang="la">vecors, vesanus;</seg> and hence the name is really the “Anti-Iupiter,” i. e. the antithesis of Iupiter, referring to Iupiter Inferus as the god of the lower world—Dis or Pluto, as noted above.

 <p> The contests of beasts with one another, or of men with beasts, that formed part of the shows of which the Romans were passionately fond.

Down to the end of the Republic these shows took place in the Circus, and the <cb /> greater exhibitions were held there even after that time, until the amphitheatres became the usual places of performance; and, indeed, when they were combined with the gladiatorial exhibitions, they took place in the early morning before them. They were continued down to the sixth century. See Friedländer, <title>Sittengeschichte Roms</title>, 5th ed. ii. pp. 348 foll.; Marquardt, <title>Staatsverwaltung</title>, iii. 565.</p>
 <p>Among the Greeks, especially the Athenians, cock-fights and quail-fights were very popular. At Athens cock-fights were held once a year in the theatres at the public expense. The training of fighting-cocks was conducted with great care. Certain places, such as Tanagra in Boeotia, Rhodes, and Delos, had the reputation of producing the largest and strongest. To whet their eagerness for the combat, they were previously fed with garlic. Their legs were armed with brass spurs, and they were set opposite to each other on tables furnished with raised edges. Bets, often to an enormous amount, were laid on the fights by the gamesters as well as by the spectators.

 <p> (1) A district in the north of Italy, originally included under the general name of Gallia Cisalpina, but made by Augustus the tenth <seg lang="la">regio</seg> of Italy. It was bounded on the west by the river Athesis, which separated it from Gallia Cisalpina; on the north by the Carnic Alps; on the east by the river Timavus, which separated it from Istria; and on the south by the Adriatic Gulf. Its inhabitants, the Veneti, frequently called Heneti (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑνετοί</foreign>) by the Greeks, were not an Italian race, but their real origin is doubtful, as their language was certainly not Keltic (Polyb. ii. 17). Herodotus speaks of them as an Illyrian race, and this is probably a correct view ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 196" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 196</bibl>; v. 9). In consequence of their hostility to the Keltic tribes in their neighbourhood, they formed at an early period 
<pb n="1642" /><cb />
 an alliance with Rome; and their country was defended by the Romans against their dangerous enemies. On the conquest of the Cisalpine Gauls, the Veneti likewise became included under the Roman dominions. The Veneti continued to enjoy great prosperity down to the time of the Marcomannic wars, in the reign of the emperor Aurelius; but from this time their country was frequently devastated by the barbarians who invaded Italy; and at length, in the fifth century, many of its inhabitants, to escape the ravages of the Huns under Attila, took refuge in the islands off their coast, on which now stands the city of Venice. The chief towns of Venetia in ancient times were Patavium, Altinum, and Aquileia.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄνεμος</foreign>). Winds were regarded by Greeks and Romans alike as divine beings. In <cb /> Homer, who mentions only the four chief winds, Boreas (North), Zephyrus (West), Eurus (East), and Notus (South), they are, according to one account ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 10. 1" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>x. 1</bibl>-75), committed by Zeus to the charge of <ref type="cross" target="crossaeolus">Aeolus</ref> (q.v.). But elsewhere they appear as independent personalities, who, dwelling in Thrace, display their activity at the command of Zeus and other gods, and are invoked by men with prayers and sacrifices ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 195" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 195</bibl>). Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 378) calls these winds children of Astraeus and Eos, and distinguishes them as beneficent beings from the destructive winds, the children of Typhoeus (<title>Theog.</title> 869). Some particular myths speak only of Boreas and Zephyrus, from whom, on account of their swiftness, famous horses were supposed to be descended. Thus ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16. 150" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xvi. 150</bibl>) the horses of Achilles are called the children of Zephyrus and Podargé, one of the Harpies (see <ref type="cross" target="crossharpyiae">Harpyiae</ref>). The latter, in accordance with their original nature, are also deities of the wind, or rather of the storm. In historical times the cult of the winds in general, or that of Boreas or Zephyrus in particular, flourished at special places in Greece. In Italy also the winds were held in much veneration, particularly the fructifying wind Favonius, which corresponded to Zephyrus. In Rome the tempests (<seg lang="la">tempestates</seg>) had a sanctuary of their own with regular sacrifices at the Porta Capena, which was founded in B.C. 259, in consequence of a vow made for the preservation of a Roman fleet in a storm at sea. Roman generals when embarking usually offered prayers to the winds and storms, as well as to the other gods, and cast offerings and bloody sacrifices into the waves to propitiate them. To the beneficent winds white animals were offered, and those of a dark colour to the malignant equinoctial and winter storms. The victims were generally rams and lambs.</p>
 <p>In works of art the winds are usually represented with winged heads and shoulders, open mouth, and inflated cheeks. The most noteworthy monument, from an artistic point of view, is the Tower of the Winds, still standing in excellent preservation at Athens, on which eight winds are represented (Boreas, North; Kaikias, Northeast; Apeliotes, East; Eurus, Southeast; Notus, South; Lips, Southwest; Zephyrus, West; and Argestes or Sciron, Northwest).

<head orig="Venus">Venus</head>

 <p> An Italian goddess, who, after the Greek mythology influenced the Roman, was identified with Aphrodité, and in Latin literature has the same myths and characteristics (see under <ref type="cross" target="crossaphrodite">Aphrodité</ref>), though originally the Italian Venus was a goddess of gardens and of spring. Prior to her identification with Aphrodité she was one of the least important of the native deities; yet her cult was established at Rome at a very early date. A stone altar with an image of Venus <hi rend="SmallCaps">Murtea</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crossmurcia">Murcia</ref> stood in the Circus near the place where the altar of Consus was concealed (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscircus">Circus</ref>), and a sanctuary of the goddess below the Aventine had a myrtle-grove before it. Another ancient name of Venus was <ref type="cross" target="crosscloacina">Cloacīna</ref>, which is said to have been derived from her image having been found in the great sewer (<hi rend="italic">cloaca);</hi> but this tale is nothing but a <hi rend="italic">volksetymologie</hi>, as the name, which is probably connected with <seg lang="la">cluere</seg>, rather marks her out as “the purifier.” Under this title her statue was erected by Titus Tatius in a temple near the Forum. Venus was also styled <hi rend="SmallCaps">Calva</hi> (“the bald”) and as such she had two temples near the Capitol. To 
<pb n="1643" /><cb />
 explain this title the story was told that one of the temples was built by Ancus Marcius because his wife was in danger of losing her hair; others thought that it was a monument of a patriotic act of the Roman women, who, during the siege of the Gauls, cut off their hair and gave it to the men to make strings for their bows; and others again supposed it to refer to the fancies and caprices of lovers, <seg lang="la">calvere</seg> signifying “to tease.” Very likely it refers to the fact that on her wedding-day the bride, either actually or symbolically, cut off a lock of hair to sacrifice it to Venus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmatrimonium">Matrimonium</ref>.) In these, the most ancient surnames of Venus, one can recognize her primitive character and attributes. She is also styled <hi rend="SmallCaps">Paeta</hi>, as to which see <ref type="cross" target="crosspaetus">Paetus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In later times, as her worship became much more extended, her identification with the Greek Aphrodité introduced various new attributes. At the beginning of the Second Punic War the worship of Venus Erycina was introduced from Sicily (see <ref type="cross" target="crosseryx">Eryx</ref>), and a temple was dedicated to her on the Capitol, to which subsequently another was added outside the Colline Gate. In the year B.C. 114, a Vestal Virgin was killed by lightning; and as the general moral corruption, especially among the Vestals, was believed to be the cause of this disaster, the Sibylline Books (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibyllae</ref>), upon being consulted, commanded that a temple should be built to Venus Verticordia (the goddess who turns the hearts of men) on the Via Salaria. After the close of the Samnite War, Fabius Gurges founded the worship of Venus Obsequens and Postvorta; Scipio Africanus the younger, that of Venus Genetrix, in which he was afterwards followed by Caesar, who added that of Venus Victrix. The worship of Venus was promoted by Caesar, who traced his descent from Aeneas, who was supposed to be the son of Mars and Venus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaeneas">Aeneas</ref>.) The month of April, as the beginning of spring, was thought to be peculiarly sacred to the goddess of love, and recalled also the early Italian conception of her functions. Both ideas are beautifully blended in the magnificent apostrophe to Venus Genetrix with which Lucretius commences his poem <title>De Rerum Natura</title>, in which she is regarded as the creative, vivifying force of Nature, the source of life and strength in all things.

 <p>The most famous of the Roman poets, born on the 15th of October, B.C. 70, at Andes (Pietola), a small village near Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul. There is no doubt that <title>Vergilius</title> is the more correct spelling, since inscriptions of the time of the Republic and the Early Empire where the name occurs give <title>Vergilius</title>, and never <title>Virgilius.</title> The same is true of the older MSS., as the Medicean; while the Greek authors write <foreign lang="greek">Βεργίλιος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Οὐεργίλιος</foreign>. In the Middle Ages (from about the ninth century) the form <title>Virgilius</title> came into use by a fanciful derivation from <seg lang="la">virga</seg> “a rod,” “a wand,” Vergil being regarded as a great necromancer, as explained later in the present article. Even in the fifteenth century, however, Politian proved this form to be erroneous, and almost the only scholars to defend it in recent times are F. Schultz in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Orthogr. Quaestiones</title> (Paderborn, 1855)</bibl>, and Oberdick in <bibl default="NO"><title>Studien z. lat. Orthographie</title> (Münster, 1879)</bibl>. (See Hübner in <title>Jahn's Jahrbücher</title>, lxii. 360, and Ritschl, <title>Opuscula</title>, ii. 779.) The earliest known instance of the spelling <title>Virgilius</title> is in the fifth century A.D. (<title>C. I. L.</title> vi. 1710).</p>
 <p>Vergil's father probably had a small estate which he cultivated, and he is said to have eked out his means by keeping bees. His mother's name was Magia Polla. He was educated at Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg> at Cremona on the day on which he began his sixteenth year, in 55. It is said that he subsequently studied at Neapolis (Naples) under Parthenius, a native of Bithynia, from whom he learned Greek. He was further instructed by Siron, an Epicurean, whose lectures were attended also 
<pb n="1644" /><cb />
 by Alfenus Varus at Rome, where he also studied rhetoric under Epidius at the same time as did Octavianus. Vergil's writings prove that he received a learned education, and traces of Epicurean opinions are apparent in them (e. g. <bibl n="Verg. G. 2. 490" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>ii. 490</bibl>). The health of Vergil was always feeble, and there is no evidence of his attempting to rise by those means through which many Romans gained distinction—oratory and arms.</p>
 <p>After completing his education, Vergil appears to have retired to his paternal property. After the battle of Philippi (42) Octavian assigned to his soldiers lands in various parts of Italy. Octavius Musa, who was charged with this allotment in the Cremona district, extended the limits so as to include Mantua (cf. <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 9. 28" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>ix. 28</bibl>), and the farm belonging to Vergil's father was assigned to a centurion, whose name is given as Arrius. Asinius Pollio, the <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> of Transpadane Gaul, and Cornelius Gallus interested themselves in Vergil, who was probably already known to them as a poet, and advised him to apply to Octavian at Rome. Vergil did so, his father's farm was restored, and the First Eclogue expresses gratitude to Octavian. But there was a second spoliation when, after the war of Perusia, Alfenus Varus became <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> in Pollio's place. A primipilaris named Milienus Toro got possession of the farm, and Vergil himself was nearly killed by the vio<figure id="fig.01644">
<head orig="Vergil Reading to Maecenas. (Painting by Jalabert.)">Vergil Reading to Maecenas. (Painting by Jalabert.)</head>
</figure> lence of a certain Clodius. Vergil and his father took refuge in a country-house belonging to Siro (<title>Catal.</title> 10), and thence removed to Rome, where he wrote the Eclogues (<title>Eclogae, Bucolica</title>). Here Maecenas also became interested in Vergil, who was compensated by Augustus. He did not, indeed, recover his paternal estate, but land was given him elsewhere—possibly the estate which he had near Nola in Campania ( <bibl n="Gel.  6. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.vi. 20</bibl>). His friendship with Maecenas was soon so firmly established that he was able to gain the same patronage for Horace ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 6" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 54" default="NO"> Sat., 54</bibl>). Horace, in <cb /> one of his Satires ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl>), in which he describes the journey from Rome to Brundusium, mentions Vergil as one of the party, and in language which shows that they were then in the closest intimacy. The most finished work of Vergil, his <title>Georgica</title>, an agricultural poem, was undertaken at the suggestion of Maecenas ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 3. 41" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iii. 41</bibl>); the concluding lines were written at Naples ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 4. 559" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iv. 559</bibl>); and the poem was completed after the battle of Actium, B.C. 31, while Octavian was in the East. Some of his pastoral poetry seems to have been written in the country about Tarentum ( <bibl n="Prop.  3. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop.iii. 24</bibl><bibl n="Prop.  67" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 67</bibl>). His Eclogues had all been completed probably before the <title>Georgica</title> were begun.</p>
 <p>The epic poem of Vergil, the <title>Aeneid</title>, was probably long contemplated by the poet. While Augustus was in Spain (27), he wrote to Vergil to express his wish for some great monument of his poetical talent. Vergil appears to have begun the <title>Aeneid</title> about this time. In 23 died Marcellus, the son of Octavia (Caesar's sister) by her first husband; and Vergil introduced into his sixth book of the <title>Aeneid</title> (883) the well-known allusion to the promise of this youth, who was cut off by a premature death. Octavia is said to have been present when the poet was reciting this allusion to her son, and to have fainted from her emotions. She rewarded the poet munificently for his excusable flattery.</p>
 <p>When Augustus was returning from Samos, where he had spent the winter of 20, he met Vergil at Athens. The poet, it is said, had intended to make a tour in Greece, but he accompanied the emperor to Megara and thence to Italy. His health, which had long been declining, was now completely broken, and he died soon after his arrival at Brundusium, on the 22d of September, B.C. 19, not having quite completed his fifty-first year. His remains were transferred to Naples, which had been his favourite residence, and on the road from Naples to Puteoli (Pozzuoli) a monument is still shown, supposed to be the tomb of the poet. The inscription said to have been placed on the tomb, <hi rend="center"><title>Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces</title>,</hi></p>
 <p>we cannot suppose to have been written by him. Vergil named as <seg lang="la">heredes</seg> in his testament his halfbrother Valerius Proculus, to whom he left onehalf of his property, and also Augustus, Maecenas, L. Varius, and Plotius Tucca. It is said that in his last illness he wished to burn the <title>Aeneid</title>, to which he had not given the finishing touches, but that his friends would not allow him. What 
<pb n="1645" /><cb />
 ever he may have wished to be done with the <title>Aeneid</title>, it was preserved and published by his friends Varius and Tucca. The poet had been enriched by the liberality of his patrons, and he left behind him a considerable property and a house on the Esquiline Hill near the gardens of Maecenas. He used his wealth liberally, and it is said that he supported his father, who had become blind, but did not die before his son had attained a mature age.</p>
 <p>In his fortunes and his friends Vergil was a happy man. Munificent patronage gave him ample means of enjoyment and of leisure, and he had the friendship of all the most accomplished men of the day, among whom Horace especially entertained a strong affection for him. He was an amiable, good-tempered man, free from the mean passions of envy and jealousy; and in all but health he was prosperous. His fame, which was established in his lifetime, was cherished after his death as an inheritance in which every Roman had a share, and his works became school-books even before the death of Augustus. They were even consulted for chance oracles (<title>sortes Vergilianae</title>) under the Roman Empire (Capit. <title>Albin.</title> 5; Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 4; Spartian. <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 2" default="NO"> <title>Hadr.</title>2</bibl>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssortes">Sortes</ref>.) The poems being full of learned and antiquarian allusions, soon gave employment to commentators and critics. Aulus Gellius has numerous remarks on Vergil; and Macrobius, in his <title>Saturnalia</title>, has filled four books (iii.-vi.) with his critical remarks on the poems. One of the most valuable commentaries on Vergil, in which a great amount of curious and instructive matter has been preserved, is that of Servius Maurus Honoratus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossservius-marius">Servius</ref>.</p>
 <p>The chief authority for the life of Vergil, apart from casual notices in his own poems or in those of contemporary poets, is the biography prefixed to the commentary written by Aelius Donatus in the fourth century A.D. This life was derived by Donatus from the biography composed by Suetonius in his <title>De Viris Illustribus.</title> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdonatus">Donatus</ref>.) Suetonius is said to have derived this information from accounts by Varius, and by Melissus, who was a freedman of Maecenas ( <bibl n="Gel.  17. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xvii. 10</bibl>). Another life of Vergil was compiled from the commentary of Valerius Probus; a third, found in Jerome, is also derived from Suetonius; a fourth, of unknown authorship, is prefixed to the commentary of Servius on the <title>Aeneid;</title> and a fifth, also of unknown date, is found in the Bernese MS. of Vergil. The grammarian Phocas, in the fifth century, made a version in hexameters of Donatus's Life of Vergil. (See Nettleship's essay prefixed to Conington's edition of Vergil.) No authentic portrait of Vergil has been preserved.</p>
 <p>The ten short poems called <title>Bucolica</title> were the earliest extant works of Vergil, and probably all written between 41 and 39. These <title>Bucolica</title> are not <title>Bucolica</title> in the same sense as the poems of Theocritus, which have the same title. They have all a pastoral form and colouring, but some of them have nothing more. They are also called <title>Eclogae</title> (“selections”), but there is no reason to suppose that this name originated with the poet. Their merit consists in their versification (which was smoother and more polished than any hexameters which the Romans had yet seen), and in their many natural and simple touches. But as an attempt to transfer the Syracusan style into Italy, they bear the stamp of imitation, and, however <cb /> graceful and melodious, cannot be ranked with the more genuine pastorals of Theocritus. The Fourth Eclogue, entitled <title>Pollio</title>, which may have been written in 40, after the peace of Brundusium, has nothing of the pastoral character about it. It is half allegorical, half historical and prophetical—anything, in fact, but bucolic. The First Eclogue is bucolic in form and in treatment, with an historical basis. The Second Eclogue, the <title>Alexis</title>, is an amatory poem, with a bucolic colouring. The third, the fifth, the seventh, and the ninth are more clearly modelled on the form of the poems of his Sicilian prototype; and the eighth, the <title>Pharmaceutria</title> (“Incantation”), is a direct imitation of the original Greek. The tenth, entitled <title>Gallus</title>, perhaps written the last of all, is a love poem, which, if written in elegiac verse, would be more appropriately called an Elegy than a Bucolic.</p>
 <p>The <title>Georgica</title>, or “Agricultural Poem,” in four books, written <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c</hi>. 37-30, is a didactic poem, which Vergil dedicated to his patron Maecenas. He treats of the cultivation of the soil in the first book, of fruit-trees in the second, of horses and cattle in the third, and of bees in the fourth. This is generally regarded as his masterpiece, and it is unquestionably the most finished and perfect of his works, showing wonderful skill in treating the more prosaic subjects of practical daily life and embellishing them with magnificent bursts of poetry, yet so as still to present a complete and harmonious work. Its versification is the perfection of the Latin hexameter. Yet, great as are these merits, the <title>Aeneid</title> is the greater poem of the two. In grandeur, in poetical matter, and, to most readers, in interest, it is superior, and yields only to the <title>Georgics</title> in artistic completeness. The <title>Georgics</title> are, no doubt, based on the works of Hesiod and Aratus, but are so treated as to be rightly regarded as an original poem. In the first book he enumerates the subjects of his poem, among which is the treatment of bees; yet the management of bees seems but meagre material for one-fourth of the whole poem, and the author accordingly completed the fourth book with matter somewhat extraneous—the long story of Aristaeus.</p>
 <p>The <title>Aeneid</title>, or adventures of Aeneas after the fall of Troy, is an epic poem on the model of the Homeric poems. It was founded upon an old Roman tradition that Aeneas and his Trojans settled in Italy, and were the founders of the Roman State. In the first book we have the story of Aeneas being driven by a storm on the coast of Africa, and being hospitably received by Dido, queen of Carthage, to whom he relates in the episode of the second and third books the fall of Troy and his own wanderings. In the fourth book the poet has elaborated the story of the love-affair of Dido and Aeneas, the departure of Aeneas in obedience to the will of the gods, and the suicide of the Carthaginian queen. The fifth book contains the visit to Sicily, and the sixth the landing of Aeneas at Cumae in Italy, and his descent to the infernal regions, where he sees his father Anchises, and has a prophetic vision of the glorious destinies of his race and of the future heroes of Rome. In the first six books the adventures of Odysseus in the <title>Odyssey</title> are the model, and these books contain more variety of incident and situation than those which follow. The last six books, the history of the struggles of Aeneas in Italy, are modelled 
<pb n="1646" /><cb />
 after the battle-scenes of the <title>Iliad.</title> Latinus, the king of the Latini, offers the Trojan hero in marriage his daughter Lavinia, who had been betrothed to Turnus, the warlike king of the Rutuli. The contest is ended by the death of Turnus, who falls by the hand of Aeneas. The fortunes of Aeneas and his final settlement in Italy are the subject of the <title>Aeneid;</title> but it is the national epic of the Roman people, and its real object is to set forth the glories of Rome, and, less directly, of the Julian house, to which Augustus belonged, and to foster in the Romans a patriotic feeling, and, still more, a religious sentiment for the gods and heroes of their ancestors. In the first book, the foundation of Alba Longa is promised by Iupiter to Venus (<title>Aeneid</title>, i. 254), and the transfer of empire from Alba to Rome; from the line of Aeneas will descend the “Trojan Caesar,” whose empire will be limited only by the ocean, and his glory by the heavens. The future rivalry between Rome and Carthage and the ultimate triumph of Rome are predicted. The poem abounds in allusions to the history of Rome; and the aim of the poet to confirm and embellish the popular tradition of the Trojan origin of the Roman State, and the descent of the Iulii from Venus, is apparent throughout. More interest is excited by Turnus than by Aeneas. It is true that it might be said of the <title>Iliad</title> that the character of Hector wins more admiration than that of Achilles; but the cases are not parallel, since Aeneas is in himself a weak and priggish person, and one unsuited to be the hero of an epic.</p>
 <p>Vergil imitated other poets besides Homer, and he has occasionally borrowed from them, especially from Apollonius of Rhodes. The historical colouring which pervades it, and the great amount of antiquarian learning which he has scattered through it, make the <title>Aeneid</title> a study for the historian of Rome. In fact, Vergil's free use of all that his predecessors had written has been often misinterpreted both in ancient and in modern times so as to be made the basis of a charge of wholesale plagiarism. One Perellius Faustus even published a book on these alleged literary thefts (<seg lang="la">furta</seg>), while Octavius Aribius made an elaborate collection of the resemblances (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιότητες</foreign>) between lines and expressions found in Vergil and those previously existing in the Greek. In fact these <seg lang="la">obtrectatores</seg> were so vehement and so numerous among his own countrymen that their assertions have found an echo in modern times. An English scholar has, however, well expressed the proper view of this phase of Vergilian criticism in the following sentences:</p>
 <p>“A most interesting feature in the <title>Aeneid</title> is its incorporation of all that was best in preceding poetry. All Roman poets had imitated, but Vergil carried imitation to an extent hitherto unknown. Not only Greek but Latin writers are laid under contribution in every page. Some idea of his indebtedness to Homer may be formed from Conington's commentary. Sophocles and the other tragedians, Apollonius Rhodius and the Alexandrians are continually imitated, and almost always improved upon. And still more is this the case with his adaptations from Naevius, Ennius, Lucretius, Hostius, Furius, etc., whose works he had thoroughly mastered, and had stored in his memory their most striking rhythms or expressions. Massive lines from Ennius, which as a rule he has spared to touch, leaving them in all their rugged grandeur <cb /> planted in the garden of his verse to point back like giant trees to the time when that garden was a forest, bear witness at once to his reverence for the old bard and to his own wondrous art. It is not merely for literary effect that the old poets are transferred into his pages. A nobler motive swayed him. The <title>Aeneid</title> was meant to be, above all things, a National Poem, carrying on the lines of thought, the style of speech, which national progress had chosen; it was not meant to eclipse so much as to do honour to the early literature. Thus those bards who like Naevius and Ennius had done good service to Rome by singing, however rudely, her history, find their <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> ranged in the gallery of the <title>Aeneid.</title> There they meet with the flamens and pontiffs unknown and unnamed, who drew up the ritual formularies, with the antiquarians and pious scholars who had sought to find a meaning in the immemorial names, whether of places or customs or persons; with the magistrates, moralists, and philosophers who had striven to ennoble or enlighten Roman virtue; with the Greek singers and sages, for they too had helped to rear the towering fabric of Roman greatness. All these meet together in the <title>Aeneid</title> as if in solemn conclave, to review their joint work, to acknowledge its final completion, and predict its impending fall. This is beyond question the explanation of the wholesale appropriation of others' thought and language, which otherwise would be sheer plagiarism. With that tenacious sense of national continuity which had given the Senate a policy for centuries, Vergil regards Roman literature as a gradually expanded whole; coming at the close of its first epoch, he sums up its results and enters into its labours. So far from hesitating whether to imitate, he rather hesitated whom not to include, if only by a single reference, in his mosaic of all that had entered into the history of Rome. His archaism is but another side of the same thing. Whether it takes the form of archaeological discussion, of antiquarian allusion, of a mode of narration which recalls the ancient source, or of obsolete expressions, forms of inflection, or poetical ornament, we feel that it is a sign of the poet's reverence for what was at once national and old. The structure of his verse, while full of music, often reminds us of the earlier writers. It certainly has more affinity with that of Lucretius than with that of Lucan. A learned Roman reading the <title>Aeneid</title> would feel his mind stirred by a thousand patriotic associations. The quaint old laws, the maxims and religious formulae he had learned in childhood would mingle with the richest poetry of Greece and Rome in a stream flowing evenly, and, as it would seem, from a single spring; and he who by his art had effected this wondrous union would seem to him the prophet as well as the poet of the era.”</p>
 <p>The larger editions of Vergil contain some short poems, which are attributed to him. The  <title>Culex</title> (“Gnat”) is a kind of bucolic poem in 413 hexameters, often very obscure. Vergil is known to have written a poem with this title ( <title>Vit.;</title> <title>Vit. Lucan.;</title>  <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 2. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>ii. 7</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 73</bibl>); but it is on the whole probable that the poem which we have is by an imitator of Vergil. The <title>Ciris</title>, or the myth of Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, king of Megara, in 541 hexameters, borrows Vergil's forms, but was probably written by an imitator of Catullus, belonging to the literary circle of 
<pb n="1647" /><cb /> Messala. The <title>Moretum</title> (“Hotchpotch”) in 123 verses, the name of a dish of various ingredients, is a poem in hexameters, on the daily labour of a cultivator; but it contains only the description of the labours of the first part of the day, which consists in preparing the <seg lang="la">moretum.</seg> It is suggested, with probability, that this may be a translation or adaptation by Vergil of a Greek poem of Parthenius. The <title>Copa</title> (“Barmaid”), in 19 elegiac couplets, is an invitation by a barmaid or servant attached to a <seg lang="la">caupona</seg> to passers-by to come in and enjoy themselves. There is no good reason against accepting this as Vergil's work. There are also fourteen short pieces in various metres, classed under the general name of <title>Catalepton</title> (sometimes written as <title>Catalecta</title>). The name is derived from a title (<foreign lang="greek">κατὰ λεπτόν</foreign>) which Aratus gave to a set of short poems (Strabo, p. 486). They were written in the period of Vergil, and it is probable that many are by Vergil—some the work of his earlier years.</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages, Vergil was a great favourite, but was much misunderstood as regards his history and personality. Partly because of a vague remembrance by the people of the episode of the Descent into Hell which forms the subject of the Sixth Book of the <title>Aeneid</title>, and partly because his Fourth Eclogue was believed to be a heathen prophecy of the birth of Christ, Vergil came at last to be regarded as a great magician. His mother's name, Magia Polla (<seg lang="la">magia</seg>, “magic,” <hi rend="italic">polla</hi> as from <seg lang="la">polleo</seg>, “mighty”), appeared to confirm this notion, and his own name as finally derived from <seg lang="la">virga</seg>, “a wand,” helped along the myth. In the strange mirage-like blending of fact and fancy that characterizes the legends of the mediaevals, Vergil was finally described as a benevolent enchanter living at Rome under King Servius, or Darius, or Octavianus, the son of a king from “Campania in the Ardennes” and the daughter of a Roman Senator under the emperor Remus, who killed his uncle Romulus. Vergil was said to have studied at the University of Toledo, but to have spent most of his time at Rome and Naples. the latter city, in fact, he was said to have founded and to have buoyed it up in the sea on eggs. See Tunison, <bibl default="NO"><title>Vergil in the Middle Age</title> (Cincinnati, 1889)</bibl>; Milberg, <bibl default="NO"><title>Mirabilia Vergiliana</title> (Meissen, 1867)</bibl>, and especially Comparetti, <title>Vergil in the Middle Ages</title>, Eng. trans. <bibl default="NO">(New York, 1896)</bibl>. The influence of Vergil on Dante is well known.</p>
 <p><ref type="cross" target="crossmanuscripts">Manuscripts</ref>.—More than 150 manuscripts of Vergil, of all degrees of value, have been discovered and classified, among them some of a very early date. The most valuable are the Codex Vaticanus (3867), of the fourth or fifth century; the Codex Palatinus (Vatican), of the same age; and the Codex Mediceus or Laurentianus (Florence), <cb /> which contains corrections made in the fifth century. Important fragments of manuscripts also exist, among them the Schedae Vaticanae, a set of sheets with illustrations, the Schedae Rescriptae Sangallenses (palimpsest), and the Schedae Rescriptae Veronenses (palimpsest). Another good source is the Codex Gudianus (Wolfenbüttel) of the ninth century. Three Codices in Berne of the ninth or tenth century also deserve mention.

 <p> so named from the brilliant discoveries of Karl Verner, first published in <title>Kuhn's Zeitschrift</title>, xxiii. 97-130 <bibl default="NO">(1875)</bibl>. It embodies an explanation of certain apparent exceptions to the laws for the first or Teutonic shifting of consonants (see <ref type="cross" target="crossgrimms-law">Grimm's Law</ref>), affecting the representation in Teutonic of the Indo-European voiceless explosives (tenues) <hi rend="italic">k, t, p</hi>, and the voiceless sibilant <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; thus, while the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Eng. <hi rend="italic">tooth</hi> corresponds regularly to the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Greek <foreign lang="greek">ὀδόντος</foreign>, in Eng. <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> it is a <hi rend="italic">d</hi> which represents the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Greek <foreign lang="greek">κρατύς</foreign>: so Germ. <foreign lang="de">bruder</foreign> and <foreign lang="de">vater</foreign>, representing Gothic <foreign lang="gothic">brōþar</foreign> and <foreign lang="gothic">fadar</foreign>, correspond to Lat. <seg lang="la">frāter</seg> and <seg lang="la">pater</seg>, both having <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> There is divergence even within the forms of the same word. The <hi rend="italic">c (k)</hi> of Lat. <foreign lang="la">dūco</foreign> is represented in Germ. <foreign lang="de">ziehen: gezogen</foreign> both by <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> It appears that Indo-European <hi rend="italic">k, t, p</hi> produce not only Teutonic <hi rend="italic">h, p(th), f</hi>, as set forth in Grimm's law, but also <hi rend="italic">g, d, b.</hi> The essential feature of Verner's discovery, which explained this diversity, was the recognition that it was connected with the diversity of the original word-accent in Indo-European. The syllable on which this accent fell varied in different words and in different forms of the same word. This method of accentuation is partially preserved in Sanskrit and Greek, as well as in the Balto-Slavic languages; cf.

 <p>The difference of the consonants in Eng. <hi rend="italic">was: were</hi> is due to the fact that in Indo-Europ. the perfect was accented on the root in the singular and on the ending in the plural, cf.

<head orig="Verres">Verres</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>. A Roman quaestor in B.C. 82 to Cn. Papirius Carbo, and who therefore at that period belonged to the Marian party. He, however, deserted Carbo and went over to Sulla , who sent him to Beneventum, where he received a share of the confiscated estates. Verres next appears as the legate of Cn. Cornelius Dolabella, praetor of Cilicia from 80 to 79, one of the most rapacious of the provincial governors. On the death of the regular quaestor, C. Malleolus, Verres became the pro-quaestor of Dolabella. In Verres, Dolabella found an active and unscrupulous agent, and, in return, connived at his excesses. But the pro-quaestor proved as faithless to Dolabella as he had been to Carbo , and turned evidence against him on his prosecution by M. Scaurus in 78. Verres was Praetor Urbanus in 74, and afterwards propraetor in Sicily, where he remained nearly three years (73-71). The extortions and exactions of Verres in the island have become notorious through the celebrated orations of Cicero. No class of the inhabitants of Sicily was exempted from his avarice, his cruelty, or his insults. The wealthy had money or works of art to yield up; the middle classes might be made to pay heavier imposts; and the exports of the vineyards, the arable land, and the loom he saddled with heavier burdens. By capricious changes or violent abrogation of their compacts, Verres reduced to beggary both the producers and the farmers of the revenue. His three years' rule desolated the island more effectually than the two recent Servile Wars and than the old struggle between Carthage and Rome for the possession of the island. So diligently did he employ his opportunities that he boasted of having amassed enough for a life of opulence, even if he were compelled to disgorge two-thirds of his plunder in stifling inquiry or purchasing an acquittal.</p>
 <p>As soon as he left Sicily the inhabitants resolved to bring him to trial. They committed the prosecution to Cicero, who had been Lilybaean quaestor in Sicily in 75, and had promised his good offices to the Sicilians whenever they might demand them. Cicero entered heartily into the cause of the Sicilians, and spared no pains to secure a conviction of the great criminal. Verres was defended by <ref type="cross" target="crosshortensius">Hortensius</ref> (q.v.) and was supported by the whole power of the aristocracy. At first his partisans attempted to stop the prosecution by bribes, flatteries, and menaces; but finding this to be impossible, they endeavoured to substitute a sham prosecutor in the place of Cicero. Hortensius therefore offered as prosecutor Q. Caecilius Niger, who had been quaestor to the defendant, had quarrelled with him, and had consequently, it was alleged, the means of exposing officially his abuse of the public money. But the Sicilians rejected Caecilius altogether, not merely as no match for Hortensius, but as foisted into the cause by the defendant or his advocate. By a technical process of the Roman law called <seg lang="la">divinatio</seg>, the <seg lang="la">iudices</seg>, without hearing evidence, determined from the arguments of counsel alone who should be appointed prosecutor. They decided in Cicero's favour. The oration which Cicero delivered on this occasion was the <title>Divinatio in Q. Caecilium.</title> The pretensions of Caecilius were thus set aside. Yet hope did not forsake Verres and his friends. Evidence for the prosecution was to be collected in Sicily itself. Cicero was allowed 110 days for the purpose. Verres once again attempted to set up a sham prosecutor, who <cb /> undertook to impeach him for his former extortions in Achaia, and to gather the evidence in 108 days. But the new prosecutor never went even so far as Brundisium in quest of evidence, and the design was abandoned. Instead of the 110 days allowed, Cicero, assisted by his cousin Lucius, completed his researches in fifty, and returned with a mass of evidence and a crowd of witnesses gathered from all parts of the island. Hortensius now grasped at his last chance of an acquittal, and it was not an unlikely one. Could the impeachment be put off to the next year, Verres was safe. Hortensius himself would then be consul, with Q. Metellus for his colleague, and M. Metellus would be Praetor Urbanus. For every firm and honest <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> whom the upright M'. Acilius Glabrio, then Praetor Urbanus, had named, a partial or venal substitute would be found. Glabrio himself would give place as <seg lang="la">quaesitor</seg> or president of the court to M. Metellus, a partisan, if not a kinsman, of the defendant. It was already the month of July. The games to be exhibited by Cn. Pompey were fixed for the middle of August, and would occupy a fortnight; the Roman games would immediately succeed them, and thus forty days intervene between Cicero's charge and the reply of Hortensius, who again, by dexterous adjournments, would delay the proceedings until the Games of Victory and the commencement of the new year. Cicero therefore abandoned all thought of eloquence or display, and, merely introducing his case in the first of the Verrine orations, rested all his hopes of success on the weight of testimony alone. Hortensius was quite unprepared with counter-evidence, and after the first day he abandoned the cause of Verres. Before the nine days occupied in hearing evidence were over, Verres quitted the city in despair, and was condemned in his absence. He retired to Marseilles, retaining so many of his treasures of art as to cause eventually his proscription by M. Antony in 43. Of the seven Verrine orations of Cicero, two only, the <title>Divinatio</title> and the <title>Actio Prima</title>, were spoken, while the remaining five were compiled from the depositions after the verdict. Cicero's own division of the impeachment is the following: <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Preliminary.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1. In Q. Caecilium or Divinatio.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">2. Prooemium—Actio Prima—Statement of the Case.</cell> </row> </table></p>
 <p>These alone were spoken. <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Orations founded on the depositions.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">3.

<head orig="Ver Sacrum">Ver Sacrum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔτος ἱερόν</foreign>). “A sacred spring.” A dedication practised by the Italian tribes, whereby, in times of severe hardship, all the products of the succeeding spring, i. e. the months of March and April, were consecrated to the gods. All the fruits and cattle were actually offered up in sacrifice; while the children that were then born, as soon as they were grown up, were driven out of the country as forfeited to heaven, and required to seek a new home. Originally both men and children were undoubtedly sacrificed, but expatriation was substituted for death as the sentiment of mercy grew more general. Whole generations in this way left their country, those of the Sabine stock being led by the animals sacred to Mars—a bull, a woodpecker, or a wolf. In Rome, whose origin is traced back by many to a Ver Sacrum, the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi> superintended the vow and its fulfilment. The Ver Sacrum was vowed for the last time in the Second Punic War, B.C. 217, after the battle of Lake Trasimenus (<bibl n="Liv.  22. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxii. 10</bibl>). The vow was not fulfilled, however, until twenty-one years afterwards, B.C. 195 and 194 (<bibl n="Liv.  33. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiii. 44</bibl>; xxxiv. 44).

Vergil in the Eighth Eclogue makes his enchanter, Moeris, do the same. It is supposed that the notion arose from the stories of the “wolf-boys” of India, of whom Mowgli, in Rudyard Kipling's <title>Jungle Book</title>, stands to the modern reader as a type.

<div2 id="crossvespasianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Vespasiānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Titus Flavius Sabīnus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman emperor from A.D. 70 to A.D. 79. He was born in the Sabine country on the 17th of November, A.D. 9. His father was a man of mean condition, of Reaté, in the country of the Sabini. His mother, Vespasia Polla, was the daughter of a <seg lang="la">praefectus castrorum</seg>, and the sister of a Roman senator. She was left a widow with two sons, Flavius Sabinus and Vespasian. Vespasian served as military tribune in Thrace, and was quaestor in Crete and Cyrené. He was afterwards aedile and praetor. About this time he married Flavia Domitilla, the daughter of a Roman <seg lang="la">eques</seg>, by whom he had two sons, both of whom succeeded him. In the reign of Claudius he was sent into Germany as <seg lang="la">legatus legionis</seg>, <cb /> and in 43 he held the same command in Britain, and reduced Vectis (Isle of Wight). He was consul in 51, and proconsul of Africa under Nero. He was at this time very poor, and was accused of getting money by dishonourable means; but he had a great military reputation, and was liked by the soldiers. Nero afterwards sent him to the East (66), to conduct the war against the Jews. His conduct of the Jewish War had raised his reputation, when the war broke out between Otho and Vitellius after the death of Galba. He was proclaimed emperor at Alexandria on the 1st of July, 69, and soon after all through the East. He reached Rome in the following year (70), leaving his son Titus to continue the war against the Jews. Titus took Jerusalem after a siege of five months; and a formidable insurrection of the Batavi, headed by Civilis, was put down about the same period. Vespasian, on his arrival at Rome, worked with great industry to restore order in the city and in the Empire. He disbanded some of the mutinous soldiers of Vitellius, and maintained discipline among his own. He co-operated in a friendly manner with the Senate in the public administration. The simplicity and frugality of his mode of life formed a striking contrast with the profusion and luxury of some of his predecessors, <figure id="fig.01651">
<head orig="Vespasian. (Naples Museum.)">Vespasian. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> and his example is said to have done more to reform the morals of Rome than all the laws which had ever been enacted. He lived more like a private person than a man who possessed supreme power: he was affable and easy of access to all persons. The personal anecdotes of such a man are some of the most instructive records of his reign. He was never ashamed of the meanness of his origin, and ridiculed all attempts to make out for him a distinguished genealogy. When Vologeses, the Parthian king, addressed to him a letter commencing in these terms, “Arsaces, king of kings, to Flavius Vespasianus,” the answer began, “Flavius Vespasianus to Arsaces, king of kings.” 
<pb n="1652" /><cb /></p>
 <p>If it be true, as it is recorded, that he was not annoyed at satire or ridicule, he exhibited an elevation of character almost unparalleled in one who filled so exalted a station. He knew the evil character of his son Domitian, and as long as he lived he kept him under proper restraint. The stories that are told of his avarice and of his modes of raising money, if true, detract from the dignity of his character; and it seems that he had a taste for petty saving and coarse humour. Yet it is admitted that he was liberal in all his expenditure for purposes of public utility. In 71 Titus returned to Rome, and both father and son triumphed together on account of the conquest of the Jews. The reign of Vespasian was marked by the conquest of North Wales and the island of Anglesey by Agricola, who was sent into Britain in 78. Vespasian also busied himself in securing the German frontier: he fortified the Agri Decumates and strengthened the defences of the Limes Germanicus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgermania">Germania</ref>.) In Italy he reorganized the Praetorian Guard, forming one of nine cohorts composed of Italians only. His financial management was marked by great economy; but he was the author of some remarkable public works at Rome, the building of the magnificent Temple of Peace, and the rebuilding of the Temple of Iupiter Capitolinus. In the summer of 79, Vespasian, whose health was failing, went to spend some time at his paternal house in the mountains of the Sabini, but derived no benefit from treatment. He still attended to business, just as if he had been in perfect health, and, on feeling the approach of death, he said that an emperor should die standing; and in fact he did die in this attitude, on the 24th of June, 79, being sixty-nine years of age. His last words were characteristic of his somewhat cynical humour, “Methinks I am becoming a god” (<title>Ut puto, deus fio</title>) ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 23" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>23</bibl>; Dio Cass. cxvi.).

<div2 id="crossvesta" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Vesta">Vesta</head>

 <p> An Italian goddess of the hearth, and more especially of the fire on the hearth, both in name and in nature akin to the Greek <ref type="cross" target="crosshestia">Hestia</ref> (q.v.), but worshipped by the Italian nations, particularly by the Latins, from ancient times independently of any connection with Greece. It has been shown that the worship of Vesta had its origin in the difficulty and the necessity of obtaining fire in primitive times. Hence, as even in the present time among savage tribes, arose the custom of keeping a fire always alight somewhere for the use of the community and of carrying fire thence for any new settlement. This custom was preserved by the conservatism of religion among civilized Greeks and Romans, after the necessity had ceased to exist, and the State-hearth was preserved in each Latin State, just as in Greece in the Prytanea; and in like fashion an outgoing settlement carried its sacred fire from the parent city. It was natural that from these observances the sacred flame itself should become personified as a goddess (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 291" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 291</bibl>) who presided over the hearth of each house, and in the State-hearth or sanctuary of Vesta over the whole commonwealth. Vesta was thus intimately connected with the Penates as deities of the household and of the State (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspenates">Penates</ref>); and the fact that the sacred fire was brought from the parent city made the Romans trace back the origin of the cult to the more ancient Latin settlements, first to Lanuvium <cb /> and Alba, and, after the idea of a Trojan origin prevailed, to Troy itself, whence it was supposed the sacred fire of Vesta as well as the Penates had come ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 2. 296" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>ii. 296</bibl>). To this cause belongs the ancient custom at Rome that praetors, consuls, and dictators, before they began their functions, sacrificed at Lanuvium, that town having been an ancient religious centre of the Latins. At Rome, as in other Latin cities, the sacred fire was tended and the service of Vesta maintained by a body of virgin priestesses, who lived together in a house (Atrium Vestae) to the southeast of the Forum, and under the northwest side of the Palatine, abutting on the Via Nova. This house, as rebuilt under Hadrian, was excavated in 1883, and from its character and the inscriptions (as late as the beginning of the fourth century A.D.) and sculptures found in it much additional light has been thrown on the Vestal service. See Jordan, <bibl default="NO"><title>Das Tempel der Vesta und d. Haus der Vestalinnen</title> (Berlin, 1886)</bibl>; and Lanciani, in his <title>Ancient Rome</title>, ch. vi. <bibl default="NO">(Boston, 1888)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>It is no doubt right to assume that the Vestals represented the daughters of the chief in the primitive tribe, who maintained the State-fire in their father's hut. When Vesta was recognized as a personal deity it became necessary that the priestesses should dwell in a sort of nunnery, and that the goddess should have a separate temple; but this Aedes Vestae preserved the shape of the primitive chief's hut, and was a round building (see illustration under <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Roma</ref>). The public worship of Vesta was maintained in this temple: her private worship belonged to every domestic hearth —in the earliest Roman houses in the <seg lang="la">atrium.</seg> In her aspect as a benign goddess of fire Vesta seems to have been akin to or identical with <ref type="cross" target="crossstata-mater">Stata Mater</ref> (q. v.). See Preuner, <bibl default="NO"><title>Hestia-Vesta</title> (Tübingen, 1864)</bibl>; Maes, <bibl default="NO"><title>Vesta e Vestali</title> (Rome, 1883)</bibl>; the discussion by Frazer in the (English) <title>Journal of Philology</title>, vol. xiv., and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crosslares">Lares</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crosspenates">Penates</ref>, and <ref type="cross" target="crossvestales">Vestales</ref>, in this Dictionary.

<head orig="Vestāles">Vestales</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Virgĭnes Vestāles.</hi> Vestal Virgins; the priestesses of Vesta. At Rome their number was at first four, but had already been increased to six during the last years of the kings. Every girl possessing the necessary qualification was liable to be called on to undertake the duty, and no exemption was granted, except upon very strict conditions. The office was confined to girls of not less than six and not more than ten years of age, without personal blemish, of free, respectable families, whose parents were still alive and resident in Italy. The choice was made by lot out of a number of twenty, nominated by the Pontifex. The virgin appointed to the priestly office immediately quitted her father's authority and entered that of the goddess. After her inauguration by the Pontifex, she was taken into the Atrium of Vesta, her future place of abode, was duly attired, and shorn of her hair. The time of service was by law thirty years, ten of which were set apart for learning, ten for performing, and ten for teaching the duties. At the end of this time leave was granted to the Vestals to lay aside their priesthood, return into private life, and marry. They seldom took advantage of this permission. They were under the control of the Pontifex, who, in the name of the goddess, exercised over them paternal authority. He administered corporal chastisement if they neglected their duties, more particularly if they allowed the sacred fire to go out; 
<pb n="1653" /><cb />
 and, if any one of them violated her vow of chas tity, he had her carried on a bier to the Campus Sceleratus, near the Colline Gate, beaten with rods, and immured alive. Her seducer was scourged to death. In fact, it has been noted that the Vestals typified to the Romans womanly chastity, just as <seg lang="la">flamen</seg> and <seg lang="la">flaminica</seg> typified the purity of the marriage-relation.</p>
 <p>No man was allowed to enter the apartments of the Vestals. Their service consisted in maintain<figure id="fig.01653">
<head orig="Vestal Virgin.">Vestal Virgin.</head>
</figure> ing and keeping pure the eternal fire in the Temple of Vesta, watching the sacred shrines, performing the sacrifices, offering the daily and, when necessary, the special prayers for the welfare of the nation, and taking part in the feasts of Vesta, Tellus, and Bona Dea. They were dressed entirely in white, with a coronetshaped head-band (<seg lang="la">infula</seg>), and ornamented with ribbons (<seg lang="la">vittae</seg>) suspended from it, and at a sacrifice covered with a white veil or hood (<seg lang="la">suffibulum</seg>) made of a piece of white woollen cloth with a purple border, rectangular in form. It was folded over the head and fastened in front below the throat by a <seg lang="la">fibula</seg> (Festus, p. 340, ed. Müller). The chief part in the sacrifices was taken by the eldest, the Virgo Vestalis Maxima.</p>
 <p>The Vestal Virgins enjoyed various distinctions and privileges. When they went out, they were accompanied by a lictor, to whom even the consul gave place; at public games they had a place of honour; they were under a guardian, and were free to dispose of their property; they gave evidence without the customary oath; they were, on account of their incorruptible character, intrusted with important wills and public treaties; death was the penalty for injuring their person; those whom they escorted were thereby protected from any assault. To meet them by chance saved the criminal who was being led away to punishment; and to them, as to men of distinguished merit, was assigned the honour of burial in the Forum.

 <p> also called <hi rend="bold">Vesēvus, Vesbius,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Vesvius</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ Βέσβιον ὄρος</foreign>). A volcanic mountain in Campania, rising out of the plain southeast of Neapolis (Naples). There are no records of any eruption of Vesuvius before the Christian era, but the ancient writers were aware of its volcanic nature from the igneous appearance of its rocks. In A.D. 63 the volcano gave the first symptoms of agitation in an earthquake, which occasioned considerable damage to several towns in its vicinity; and on the 24th of August, A.D. 79, occurred the first great eruption of Vesuvius, which overwhelmed the cities of Stabiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. It was in this eruption that the elder Pliny lost his life. See <ref type="cross" target="crossherculaneum">Herculaneum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspompeii">Pompeii</ref>.

<div2 id="crossvia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Via">Via</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign>). A road. The earliest roads in Greece were the sacred ways, which led to the most important religious centres, where national festivals were celebrated, such festivals also serving the purpose of public markets or fairs. In general, the Greeks set a high value on well-levelled roads, which made travelling easy; but, in the best days of Greece, only unpaved roads were known, paved roads being of comparatively late origin.</p>
 <p>The finest work in ancient road-making was that done by the Romans, who, mainly for military purposes, connected Rome with her newly acquired provinces by means of high-roads. They laid out their roads as far as possible in straight lines. The nature of the ground was almost entirely disregarded; where mountains intervened they were broken through, and interposing streams and valleys were spanned with bridges and viaducts.</p>
 <p>The first Roman high-road, which, even in its present condition, is worthy of admiration, was the Via Appia, so called after the censor Appius <figure id="fig.01654.2">
<head orig="Via Appia, near Ariccia. (Canina.)">Via Appia, near Ariccia. (Canina.)</head>
</figure> Claudius, who constructed it. It was made in B.C. 312 to join Rome to Capua, and was afterwards continued as far as Brundisium. This “queen of roads,” <seg lang="la">regina viarum</seg> ( <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 12</bibl>), was a stone causeway, constructed, according to the nature of the country, with an embankment either beneath or beside it, and was of such a width that two broad wagons could easily pass each other. The surface was paved with polygonal blocks of hard stone, generally basalt, fitted closely together, and so laid down that the middle of the road was at a higher level than the sides, to <figure id="fig.01654.3">
<head orig="Pavement of Via Appia. (Piranesi.)">Via Appia, near Ariccia. (Canina.)</head>
</figure> allow the rain-water to run off. According to a subsequent method, the Roman roads first received a foundation of rubble or <hi rend="italic">breccia</hi>, on which rested a layer of flat stones eight inches thick; above this was an equally thick layer of stones set in lime, which was covered by another layer of rubble about three inches deep. Above the rubble was laid down the pavement proper, consisting of either hard stone (<seg lang="la">silex</seg>) or else irregular blocks of basaltic lava. 
<pb n="1655" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the time of the emperor Hadrian, the cost of constructing such a road amounted to $4500 per Roman mile (about 4/5 English mile). From the end of the second century B.C. posts set up at a distance of 1000 paces from each other served to measure distances. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Miliarium</hi>.</p>
 <p>The making and maintenance of the roads in Italy were provided for at the expense of the <seg lang="la">aerarium</seg>, or State treasury. During the republican age the roads were under the supervision of the censors. From the time of Augustus they were under imperial officials entitled <seg lang="la">curatores viarum.</seg> In the provinces, in general, the cost of the military roads, and indeed of all public works, was defrayed out of the provincial taxes. In the imperial provinces soldiers were also frequently employed in constructing roads. In a few cases toll was levied by special imperial permission. The following list of the great Roman roads that issued directly from the capital will be convenient for reference:</p>
 <p>I. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Appia</hi>, the Great South Road. It was in perfect repair when Procopius wrote, long after the devastating inroads of the northern barbariaus; and even to this day the cuttings through hills and masses of solid rock, the filling up of hollows, the bridging of ravines, the substructions to lessen the rapidity of steep descents, and the embankments over swamps, demonstrate the vast sums and the prodigious labour that must have been lavished on its construction. It issued from the Porta Capena, and, passing through Aricia, Tres Tabernae, Appii Forum, Tarracina, Fundi, Formiae, Minturnae, Sinuessa, and Casilinum, terminated at Capua, but was eventually extended through Calatia and Caudium to Beneventum, and finally from thence through Venusia, Tarentum, and Uria, to Brundisium.</p>
 <p>The ramifications of the Via Appia most worthy of notice are:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Setīna</hi>, which connected it with Setia.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Domitiāna</hi> struck off at Sinuessa, and, keeping close to the shore, passed through Liternum, Cumae, Puteoli, Neapolis, Herculaneum, Oplonti, Pompeii, and Stabiae to Surrentum, making the complete circuit of the Bay of Naples.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Campāna</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crossconsularis">Consulāris</ref>, from Capua to Cumae, sending off a branch to Puteoli, and another through Atella to Neapolis.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Aquillia</hi> began at Capua, and ran south through Nola and Nuceria to Salernum; from thence, after sending off a branch to Paestum, it took a wide sweep inland through Eburi and the region of the Mons Alburnus up the valley of the Tanager; it then struck south through the very heart of Lucania and Bruttium, and, passing Nerulum, Interamnia, and Consentia, returned to the sea at Vibo, and thence through Medma to Rhegium. This road sent off a branch near the sources of the Tanager, which ran down to the sea at Blanda or the Laus Sinus, and then continued along the whole line of the Bruttian coast through Laus and Terina to Vibo, where it joined the main stem.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Egnatia</hi> began at Beneventum, struck north through the country of the Hirpini to Equus Tuticus, entered Apulia at Aecae, and, passing through Herdonia, Canusium, and Rubi, <cb /> reached the Adriatic at Barium, and followed the coast through Egnatia to Brundisium.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Traiāna</hi> began at Venusia and ran in a nearly straight line across Lucania to Heraclea on the Sinus Tarentinus; thence following, southward, the line of the east coast, it passed through Thurii, Crotona, and Scyllacium, and completed the circuit of Bruttium by meeting the Via Aquillia at Rhegium.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">A Via Minucia</hi> is mentioned by Cicero, and a <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Numicia</hi> by Horace, both of which seem to have passed through Samnium from north to south, connecting the Valerian and Aquillian, and cutting the Appian and Latin Ways. Their course is unknown. Some believe them to be one and the same.</p>
 <p>II. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Latīna</hi>, another great line leading to Beneventum, but keeping a course farther inland than the Via Appia. Soon after leaving the city, it sent off a short branch (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Tusculāna</hi>) to Tusculum, and, passing through Compitum Anagninum, Ferentium, Frusino, Fregellae, Fabrateria, Aquinum, Casinum, Venafrum, Teanum, Allifae, and Telesia, joined the Via Appia at Beneventum.</p>
 <p>A cross-road, called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Hadriāna</hi>, running from Minturnae through Suessa Aurunca to Teanum, connected the Via Appia with the Via Latina.</p>
 <p>III. From the Porta Esquilina issued the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Labicāna</hi>, which, passing Labicum, fell into the Via Latina at the station ad Bivium, thirty miles from Rome.</p>
 <p>IV. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Praenestīna</hi>, originally the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Gabīna</hi>, issued from the same gate with the former. Passing through Gabii and Praenesté, it joined the Via Latina just below Anagnia.</p>
 <p>V. Passing over the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Collatīna</hi> as of little importance, we find the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Tiburtīna</hi>, which issued from the Porta Tiburtina, and, proceeding northeast to Tibur, a distance of about twenty miles, was continued from thence, in the same direction, under the name of the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Valeria</hi>, and, traversing the country of the Sabines, passed through Carseoli and Corfinium to Aternum on the Adriatic, thence to Adria, and so along the coast to Castrum Truentinum, where it fell into the Via Salaria.</p>
 <p>A branch of the Via Valeria led to Sublaqueum, and was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Sublacensis</hi>. Another branch extended from Adria along the coast southward through the country of Frentani to Larinum, being called, as some suppose, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Frentāna Apŭla</hi>.</p>
 <p>VI. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Nomentāna</hi>, anciently <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ficulnensis</hi>, ran from the Porta Collina, crossed the Anio to Nomentum, and, a little beyond, fell into the Via Salaria at Eretum.</p>
 <p>VII. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Salaria</hi>, also from the Porta Collina (passing Fidenae and Crustumerium), ran north and east through Sabinum and Picenum to Reaté and Asculum Picenum. At Castrum Truentinum it reached the coast, which it followed until it joined the Via Flaminia at Ancona.</p>
 <p>VIII. Next comes the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Flaminia</hi>, the Great North Road, commenced in the censorship of C. Flaminius, and carried ultimately to Ariminum. It issued from the Porta Flaminia, and proceeded nearly north to Ocriculum and Narnia in Umbria. Here a branch struck off, making a sweep to the east through Interamna and Speletium, and fell again into the main trunk (which passed through Mevania) at Fulginia. <figure id="fig.01656">
<head orig="The Via Appia Restored. (Falke.)">The Via Appia Restored. (Falke.)</head>
</figure> It continued through Fanum Flaminii and Nuceria, 
<pb n="1656" /><cb /> where it again divided, one line running nearly straight to Fanum Fortunae on the Adriatic, while the other, diverging to Ancona, continued from thence along the coast to Fanum Fortunae, where the two branches, uniting, passed on to Ariminum through Pisaurum. From thence the Via Flaminia was extended under the name of the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Aemilia</hi>, and traversed the heart of Cisalpine Gaul through Bononia, Mutina, Parma, Placentia (where it crossed the Po), to Mediolanum. From this point branches were sent off through Bergomum, Brixia, Verona, Vicentia, Patavium, and Aquileia to Tergesté on the east, and through Novaria, Vercelli, Eporedia, and Augusta Praetoria to the Alpis Graia on the west, besides another branch in the same direction through Ticinum and Industria to Augusta Taurinorum. Nor must we omit the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Postumia</hi>, which struck from Verona right down across the Apennines to Genoa, passing through Mantua and Cremona, crossing the Po at Placentia, and so through Iria, Dertona, and Libarna, sending off a branch from Dertona to Asta.</p>
 <p>Of the roads leading out of the Via Flaminia in the immediate vicinity of Rome, the most important is the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Cassia</hi>, which, diverging near the Pons Mulvius, and passing not far from Veii, traversed Etruria through Baccanae, Sutrium, Vulsinii, Clusium, Arretium, Florentia, Pistoria, and Luca, joining the Via Aurelia at Luna.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Amerīna</hi> broke off from the Via Cassia near Baccanae, and held north through Falerii, Tuder, and Perusia, reuniting itself with the Via Cassia at Clusium.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Not far from the Pons Mulvius the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Clodia</hi> separated from the Via Cassia, and, proceeding to Sabaté on the Lacus Sabatinus, there divided into two, the principal branch passing through central Etruria to Rusellae, and thence due north to Florentia, the other passing through Tarquinii, and then falling into the Via Aurelia.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Beyond Baccanae the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Cimīna</hi> branched off, crossing the Mons Ciminus, and rejoining the Via Cassia near Fanum Voltumnae.</p>
 <p>IX. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Aurelia</hi>, the Great Coast Road, issued <cb /> originally from the Porta Ianiculensis, and subsequently from the Porta Aurelia. It reached the coast at Alsium, and followed the shore of the lower sea, along Etruria and Liguria, by Genua, as far as Forum Iulii in Gaul. In the first instance it extended no farther than Pisa.</p>
 <p>X. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Portuensis</hi> kept the right bank of the Tiber to Portus Augusti.</p>
 <p>XI. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Ostiensis</hi> originally passed through the Porta Trigemina, afterwards through the Porta Ostiensis, and kept the left bank of the Tiber to Ostia. From thence it was continued, under the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Severiāna</hi>, along the coast southward through Laurentum, Antium, and Circaei, till it joined the Via Appia at Tarracina. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Laurentīna</hi>, leading direct to Laurentum, seems to have branched off from the Via Ostiensis at a short distance from Rome.</p>
 <p>XII. Lastly, the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Via Ardeatīna</hi>, from Rome to Ardea. According to some, this branched off from the Via Appia.</p>
 <p>Travelling on the public roads was facilitated by the establishment of <seg lang="la">(a) mutationes</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλλαγαί</foreign>) or posting-houses, where horses were changed and vehicles were obtainable if required; and <seg lang="la">(b) mansiones</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">καταλύσεις</foreign>), stations, caravansaries, or resting-places, where the journey could be conveniently broken. The towns and places where a halt on one ground or the other could be made are frequently detailed in the Antonine Itinerary. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscursus-publicus">Cursus Publicus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossitineraria">Itineraria</ref>.</p>
 <p>The following illustration of a part of the Via Stabiana at Pompeii shows four stepping-stones. <figure id="fig.01656.2">
<head orig="Via Stabiana at Pompeii, with Stepping-stones. (From a photograph.)">Via Stabiana at Pompeii, with Stepping-stones. (From a photograph.)</head>
</figure> They are to be found in nearly every street in the town, whatever its breadth. The narrower streets are practically blocked by single large stones in their centres; the broader streets are crossed by rows, containing from two to five stones. Their shape is, generally, a flat-topped oval: larger and smaller stones lying side by side. They measure, very commonly, about three feet by eighteen inches, and have their longer axis parallel to the 
<pb n="1657" /><cb />
 footway on either side of the street. The height of the footway ranges from twelve to eighteen inches above the carriagè-way, and the particular height is, in most cases, that of the stepping-stones also. The surface of the street being elliptical, the stone on the centre stands slightly higher than those at the sides. Many streets are marked with wheel-ruts, some of them deeply cut. They are found both in the interstices between the steppingstones and elsewhere. The distance from rut to rut measures, as a rule, one yard, which was, accordingly, the gauge of the ordinary vehicles. Some special consideration of these stepping-stones is desirable.</p>
 <p>Until the reign of Septimius Severus (A.D. 193- 211) riding and driving, both in Rome and in the provincial towns, were closely restricted, and at times forbidden, by law (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. 206; Marquardt, <title>Privatleben</title>, ii. 727-738). Claudius (A.D. 41-54) forbade travellers to drive in carriages through provincial towns (Sueton. <title>Claud.</title> c. 25). Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 161-180) again forbade riding and driving in provincial towns. Under Severus carriages, in Rome at least, seem to have been more commonly used (Dio Cass. lxiv. 4).</p>
 <p>Thus, the street-traffic of the ordinary Roman provincial town seems to have resembled that of the Tangier or Tetuan of to-day. Heavy burdens were carried on the backs of horses, mules, or cattle. Walking was the rule, riding on horseback or in a litter was the exception, driving almost unknown. Before the date of the edict of Claudius, and perhaps later, the law was probably indulgent to towns such as Baiae and Pompeii. Thither came the “carriage-company” of Rome to seek health and spend money. In the case of Pompeii carriages and horses were, beyond a doubt, confined to certain streets. An extant inscription shows that the station of the <seg lang="la">cisiarii</seg> was not even within the town walls. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscisium">Cisium</ref>.) Other streets were always reserved for foot-passengers, and possibly for litters. Others, again, once open to all traffic, and still bearing the marks of wheels, were afterwards closed to all but foot-passengers by huge steppingstones or iron gratings.</p>
 <p>The deep ruts already mentioned were the natural result of confining the traffic to a few streets. None of these were broad enough to allow of any considerable variation of the track, even had the fixed stepping-stones presented no additional difficulty. Moreover, there is evidence that some of the existing pavements bore traffic for at least 120 years. It is not surprising that even a small amount of wheeled traffic, unrelieved by the use of springs, and acting on the same stones for so many years, should have left deep traces behind.</p>
 <p>The reasons for the erection of very large stepping-stones were, no doubt, at once local and practical. Pompeii occupies the summit and slopes of a small hill. Hence the lower streets, according to the drainage level of the ground, received the rain-water and refuse of the upper. In times of heavy rain the lower streets must have flowed like a torrent. No sewerage-system could have at once mastered the downward rush of the water. Indeed a similar sight may now be witnessed, during the winter rains, in the heavily paved streets of Florence, where stepping-stones of the largest size would not be out of place. At Pompeii, where the lie of the ground, together with the close-set stone surface and sides of the streets, provided a <cb /> ready-made watercourse, sidewalks of substantial height were absolutely necessary to foot-passengers. The means of crossing from one sidewalk to another, in any weather, were therefore naturally provided by stepping-stones of corresponding size.</p>

 <p> Generic terms for food. Both the Greeks and the Romans gave much attention to gastronomy, the latter people, however, getting their knowledge of scientific cookery from the former. The chief sources of our information are, apart from the many causal allusions in the classic writers in general, Athenaeus (whose <title>Deipnosophistae</title> is full of curious lore regarding food, cookery, and the <seg lang="la">ana</seg> of distinguished epicures), Pliny the Elder, and the pseudo-Apicius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapicius">Apicius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossathenaeus">Athenaeus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossplinius">Plinius</ref>.) As early as the second century B.C. there existed special dictionaries of terms employed in cookery. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslexicon">Lexicon</ref>.</p>
 <p>The articles of diet found in the ancient <hi rend="italic">menus</hi> include most of the things that are eaten in modern times—the fish, flesh, and fowl at any rate. Of the fish, the mullet (<seg lang="la">mullus</seg>), turbot (<seg lang="la">rhombus</seg>), and carp (<seg lang="la">cyprinus</seg>) were especially prized. A sort of fish-sauce (<seg lang="la">garum</seg>), resembling anchovy-sauce or perhaps caviare, was also held in high esteem by gourmets. Oysters were dear in price and greatly liked, the best natives coming from Circeii. British oysters were imported from Rutupiae (Richborough), on the southern coast of Britain. Of meats, pork was held to be a dainty, whether as ham (<seg lang="la">perna</seg>) or in the form of <seg lang="la">glandulae</seg>, over which the parasite in the <title>Captivi</title> of Plautus grows so enthusiastic, or potted in the <seg lang="la">tucetum</seg> (q. v.). The breasts of a sow killed just after she had littered, but before she had given suck, were much sought, and the matrix (<seg lang="la">vulva</seg>) of the same animal, stuffed with onions, is often spoken of as extremely delectable. Sausages (<seg lang="la">botuli</seg>) were popular, but less the diet of the wealthy than of the poor, being hawked about the streets by itinerant venders. Beef and lamb were not very highly esteemed; nor was chicken a great dainty, capons excepted. Thrushes (<seg lang="la">turdi</seg>), pheasants (<seg lang="la">phasiani</seg>), fig-peckers (<seg lang="la">ficedulae</seg>), larks (<seg lang="la">alaudae</seg>), guinea-hens (<hi rend="italic">meleagrides</hi>), and many other birds were sought as food. As in Italy and Southern France to-day, snails formed an esteemed article of diet. They were fattened on meal especially for the market, and sometimes attained to a huge size. The Romans served up dormice (<hi rend="italic">glires</hi>) at expensive banquets. Maecenas introduced at Rome the flesh of young asses as a fashionable dish. The common people ate comparatively little meat, but made bread, fruit, salad, and the national dish <hi rend="italic">puls</hi> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspuls">Puls</ref>) their principal fare. Tripe (<seg lang="la">omentum</seg>) was also an especially plebeian dish. Oil was liberally used in the various dishes, as in Italy to-day. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossoliva">Oliva</ref>.) The most frequently mentioned condiments were salt (<hi rend="italic">sal</hi>), pepper (<seg lang="la">piper</seg>), garlic (<seg lang="la">allium</seg>), leek (<seg lang="la">porrum</seg>), mustard (<seg lang="la">sinapis</seg>), and poppy-seeds. Asafoetida (<seg lang="la">silphium</seg>) was also used as a seasoning, its flavour being not unlike that of garlic. On vinegar, see <ref type="cross" target="crossacetum">Acetum</ref>.

 <p>The ordinary fruits and vegetables were sold in the markets: grapes, apples, pears, peaches, plums, oranges, figs, quinces, melons, pomegranates, nuts, and pease, beets, cucumbers (which were also pickled), lettuce, beans, onions, turnips, cabbages, cauliflowers, and radishes.</p>
 <p>The skill of the pastry-cook did much towards making a formal dinner successful. Pastry was set upon the table in the most varied forms, animal and vegetable, some idea of which may be gathered from the <title>Cena Trimalchionis.</title> Eggs of paste were served which, when broken, revealed young birds inside delicately cooked in sauce that counterfeited the appearance of a yolk. Cakes and sweetmeats were made in great quantities, honey being used for sweetening them. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossplacenta">Placenta</ref>; Scriblita.) Cheese entered largely into Roman cookery, especially into the manufacture of cakes, and the description of some of these as so made is very appetizing. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaseus">Caseus</ref>.) Butter was not largely used, its place being taken by oil. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbutyrum">Butyrum</ref>.)

Policemen were regularly detailed for duty at the theatres, public baths, and other places of public resort; and had very considerable powers, resembling those exercised by the police in the Continental cities. As firemen they were provided with axes, ropes, buckets, and also operated a kind of hand fire-engine (<seg lang="la">sipho, sipo</seg>), whence they received the popular nickname of <hi rend="italic">siponarii.</hi> Each of the seven cohorts was commanded by a captain <cb /> (<seg lang="la">tribunus</seg>), and the whole force numbered 7000 men.

 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossvilla" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Villa">Villa</head>

 <p> A Roman farm or country-house, of which Roman writers mention two kinds— (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the <seg lang="la">villa rustica</seg> or farm-house, and (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the <seg lang="la">villa urbana</seg> or <seg lang="la">pseudo-urbana</seg>, a residence in the country or in the suburbs of a town. When both of these were attached to an estate, they were generally united in the same range of buildings, but sometimes they were placed at different parts of the estate. The part of the <seg lang="la">villa rustica</seg> in which the produce of the farm was kept was called <seg lang="la">villa fructuaria.</seg></p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <seg lang="la">villa rustica</seg> is described by Varro (<title>R. R.</title> i. 11-13), Vitruvius (vi. 9), and Columella (i. 4. 5 foll.).</p>
 <p>The villa, which must be of size corresponding to that of the farm, is best placed at the foot of a wooded mountain, in a spot supplied with running water, and not exposed to severe winds nor to the effluvia of marshes, nor (by being close to a road) to a too frequent influx of visitors. If there was no running stream, tanks were constructed, one under cover for men, one in the open air for the beasts. The villa attached to a large farm had two courts (<seg lang="la">cohortes, chortes, cortes</seg>, Varro, i. 13). At the entrance to the outer court was the abode of the <seg lang="la">vilicus</seg> or steward, that he might observe who went in and out, and over the door was the room of the <seg lang="la">procurator</seg> (Colum. i. 6). Near this, in as warm a spot as possible, was the kitchen, which, besides being used for the preparation of food, was the place where the slaves (<seg lang="la">familiae</seg>) assembled after the labours of the day, and where they performed certain indoor work. Vitruvius places near the kitchen the baths and the press (<seg lang="la">torcular</seg>) for wine and oil. In the outer court were also the cellars for wine and oil (<seg lang="la">cellae vinariae et oleariae</seg>), which were placed on the level ground, and the granaries, which were in the upper stories of the farm-buildings, and carefully protected from damp,

 <p>A striking difference in the general aspect of a country-house from that of a town-house lay in the fact that the blank walls of the latter were replaced by long colonnades, broken by towers, apses, and the like.</p>
 <p>The chief sources of information on this subject are two letters of Pliny , in one of which (ii. 17) he describes his Laurentine villa, in the other (v. 6) his Tuscan. The former of these, however, was not, strictly speaking, a <seg lang="la">villa</seg>, as it had no estate or farm-buildings attached to it; the latter was connected with a large estate.

 <p> A Roman province, bounded on the north by the Danube, which separated it from Germany, on the west by the territory of the Helvetii in Gaul, on the south by Rhaetia, and on the east by the river Oenus (Inn), which separated it from Noricum, thus corresponding to the northeastern part of Switzerland, the southeast of Baden, the south of Würtemberg and Bavaria, and the northern part of the Tyrol. It was originally a part of the province of Rhaetia, and was conquered by Tiberius in the reign of Augustus. At a later time Rhaetia was divided into two provinces, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Rhaetia Prima</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Rhaetia Secunda</hi>, the latter of which names was gradually supplanted by that of Vindelicia. It was drained by the tributaries of the Danube, of which the most important were the Licias, or Licus (Lech), with its tributary the Vindo, Vinda, or Virdo (Werlach), the Isarus (Isar), and Oenus (Inn). The eastern part of the Lacus Brigantinus (Lake of Constance) also belonged to Vindelicia. It derived its name from its chief inhabitants, the <ref type="cross" target="crossvindelici">Vindelĭci</ref>, a warlike people dwelling in the south of the country. The other tribes in Vindelicia were the Brigantii on the Lake of Constance, the Licatii or Licates on the Lech, and the Breuni (in the north of the Tyrol) on the Brenner. The chief town in the province was Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), at the confluence of the Vindo and the Licus.

<head orig="Vinum">Vinum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">οἶνος</foreign>). From the earliest times wine was the usual drink of the Greeks, and was made in every Hellenic country. The best was produced on the coasts and islands of the Aegean, such as Thasos, Rhodes, Cyprus, and, above all, <cb /> Chios and Lesbos. The Greeks noted three colours in wines: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) red (<foreign lang="greek">μέλας</foreign>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) white or strawcoloured (<foreign lang="greek">λευκός</foreign>); and brown or amber-coloured (<foreign lang="greek">κιρρός</foreign>). The processes of making wine were substantially the same among both Greeks and Romans; but the more detailed information given by the ancient writers relates to the wines produced in Italy.</p>
 <p>The cultivation of the vine was common in Lower Italy before its colonization by the Greeks, and the Romans had vineyards in very early times. In fact, one of the early names of Italy was Oenotria, or “land of the vine-pole.” Wine was, however, long regarded as an article of luxury, and was limited in its use. The regular production of wine (the method of which was imported from Greece, together with the finer varieties of vines) first came in with the decline of the cultivation of cereals. The home-grown wines were of little esteem, as compared with the Greek, and especially the highly prized island wines, until the first century B.C. After this date the careful treatment of a number of Italian, and more particularly of Campanian, brands (such as the Falernian, Caecuban, and Massic) gained for them the reputation of being the first wines of the world. They formed an important article of export, not merely to the collective provinces of the Roman Empire, Greece herself not excepted, but also beyond the Roman frontier, so that even in India they were known (Arrian, <bibl n="Hanno Peripl. 6" default="NO"> <title>Peripl.</title>6</bibl><bibl n="Hanno Peripl. 49" default="NO"> Peripl., 49</bibl>). It was to protect the Italian wine-growers that, in the western provinces, down to the third century A.D., the cultivation of the vine was subject to certain limitations. No new vineyards could be added to those already existing, and the Italian vines could not be introduced, although Gaul produced many varieties of wine. Under the Empire, wine was the main article of produce and of trade in Italy, Greece, and Asia; and the wine merchants of Rome, who had, from the commencement of the second century, formed two corporations, one for the eastern and another for the western trade, held an important position. In the first century there were already eighty famous brands in the Roman market, of which number Italy supplied two-thirds. The finest wine made in Italy was the Setine (<title>vinum Setinum</title>), the chosen drink of Augustus, and made at Setia, near the Pontine Marshes. Next comes the Falernian, which required ten years to mature; then the Alban, both sweet and dry; the Massic, often mentioned by Horace; the Surrentine, which was not at its best until kept for twenty-five years; the Calene, a light wine; the Veliternian, and the Signine. The Mamertine, a light, sweet wine, was the favourite drink of Iulius Caesar ( <bibl n="Mart.  13. 117" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiii. 117</bibl>). Etruscan wines were generally bad, and so were the wines of Gaul, these being often “doctored” with aloes and other drugs. Good wine was imported from Asia Minor, especially from parts of Pontus, Paphlagonia, Bithynia, and Phoenicia. The Mareotic wine of Egypt was also much esteemed. It was a white wine, sweet and light, and with a delightful <hi rend="italic">bouquet.</hi> Even more popular was the <title>vinum Taenioticum</title> from the Egyptian Delta.</p>
 <p>The vine was grown partly on poles or espaliers, partly on trees, especially on elms, which, if the ground between were still used for agriculture, were planted at a distance of forty, sometimes of twenty, feet apart. The grapes intended for manufacture 
<pb n="1662" /><cb />
 into wine were trodden with naked feet and then brought under the press. The must was then immediately poured into large pitched earthenware jars (<foreign lang="greek">πίθος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">dolium</seg>). These were placed under ground in a wine-cellar, facing the north to keep them cool, and kept uncovered for a year in order to ferment thoroughly. The inferior wines which were of no great age were drunk immediately from the jar ( <title>Brutus</title>, 228). The better kinds, which were meant for preservation, were poured into <seg lang="la">amphorae.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphora">Amphora</ref>.) These were closed with stone stoppers, sealed with pitch, clay, or gypsum, marked with a brand, furnished with a label (<seg lang="la">tessera</seg> or <seg lang="la">nota</seg>) giving their year and measure, and placed in the <seg lang="la">apotheca.</seg> This was a room in the upper story, built by preference over the bath-room in order to catch the smoke from the furnace, and thus to make the wine more mellow. Wine was also “improved” or its process of mellowing hastened by exposing the <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg> to the full glow of the sunlight, and sometimes by the use of chemicals. Sometimes, again, the vessels containing the must were sunk in the sea, the wine being then styled <seg lang="la">thalassites</seg> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14. 78" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 78</bibl>). By the Greeks, at least in the early period, wines were drunk mixed with various substances, as grated cheese and flour ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 638" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 638</bibl>), barley-meal and honey ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 10. 234" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>x. 234</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The most famous vintage year in Roman history was the year B.C. 121, when L. Opimius was consul. Great quantities of this year's wine were stored up, and some was in existence in Pliny 's time, about two hundred years later ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14.  55" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 55</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H. N., 94</bibl>). It was known as <title>vinum Opimianum</title>, and is often mentioned in literature.</p>
 <p>One method of improving the wine which was used in the East and in Greece was to keep the wine in goat-skins (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσκοί</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">utres</hi>), because the leather tended to cause evaporation of the water. In Italy the wine-skins appear to have been only used in transport. To produce flavour, strength, and bouquet, various means were employed, such as adding gypsum, clay, chalk, marble, resin, pitch, and even sea water, the last being especially in use in Greece and Asia Minor. Bad wines were improved by being mixed with fine brands and good lees; adulteration was extremely common. The number of artificial wines was very large; e. g. honey wine (<seg lang="la">mulsum</seg>), raisin wine (<seg lang="la">passum</seg>), and boiled must (the beverage of the common people and slaves), a poor drink prepared by pouring water on the remains of the pressed grapes, and called <foreign lang="greek">θάμνα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">lora.</seg></p>
 <p>The place of our liqueurs was taken by flavoured wines, of which more than fifty kinds are mentioned. These were simply extracted from herbs, flowers, or sweet-smelling woods (thyme, myrtle, sweet rush, rose, heart's-ease, pine-cones and pinewood, cypress, etc.), or mixed with oils, such as nard or myrrh. There were also wines made from fruits, such as apples, pomegranates, pears, dates, figs, or mulberries. In respect of colour three sorts of wine were distinguished: the black or dark red (<seg lang="la">color sanguineus</seg> and <seg lang="la">niger</seg>) which was considered the strongest; the white (<seg lang="la">albus</seg>), which was thought thin and weak; and the brown or amber-coloured (<seg lang="la">fulvus</seg>), which was considered particularly serviceable for promoting digestion. As in its ordinary treatment the wine often retained much sediment, it had to be made clear before it was drunk. This was done either with <cb /> yolk of eggs or by straining the wine through a cloth or sieve, which was filled with snow to make it cool. Greeks and Romans alike generally drank their wine liberally mixed with water; and to drink it unmixed (<seg lang="la">merum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ἄκρατον</foreign>) was regarded as a sign of great intemperance.

 <p> A Latin divinity worshipped along with Diana in the grove at Aricia, at the foot of the Alban Mount. He is said to have been the same as Hippolytus, who was restored to life by Asclepius at the request of Artemis. It was told that Hippolytus was placed by this goddess under the care of the nymph Aricia, and received the name of Virbius. By this nymph he became the father of a son, who was also called Virbius, and whom his mother sent to the assistance of Turnus against Aeneas ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 7. 761" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vii. 761</bibl>; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 15. 545" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xv. 545</bibl>). This is a transference to Italy of the story of Hippolytus being devoted to the service of Artemis. It has been suggested with great probability that Virbius was originally a tree spirit of the sacred grove, to whom horses (as representatives of the spirit) were sacrificed. Hence they were in time represented as hostile to the deity Virbius, and therefore excluded from the grove. This was explained by making Virbius the same as Hippolytus, whose death was caused by his horses running away. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshippolytus">Hippolytus</ref>.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Verginia.</hi> The daughter of L. Virginius, a Roman centurion. She was a beautiful and innocent girl, betrothed to L. Icilius. Her beauty excited the lust of the decemvir Appius Claudius, who instigated one of his clients to seize the maiden and claim her as his slave. Her father, who had come from the camp the morning on which Claudius gave judgment assigning Virginia to his client, seeing that all hope was gone, prayed the decemvir to be allowed to speak one word to the nurse in his daughter's hearing, in order to ascertain whether she was really his daughter. The request was granted; Virginius drew them both aside, and snatching up a butcher's knife from one of the stalls, plunged it into his daughter's breast, exclaiming, “There is no way but this to keep thee free”; then, holding his bloody knife on high, he rushed to the gate of the city, and hastened to the Roman camp. The result is known. Both camp and city rose against the decemvirs, who were deprived of their power, and the old form of government was restored. L.

 <p> A Roman consul A.D. 63, and governor of Upper Germany at the time of the revolt of Iulius Vindex in Gaul (68). The soldiers of Virginius wished to raise him to the Empire; but he refused the honour, and marched against Vindex, who perished before Vesontio. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvindex">Vindex</ref>.) After the death of Nero, Virginius supported the claims of Galba, and accompanied him to Rome. After Otho's death the soldiers again attempted to proclaim Virginius emperor, and in consequence of his refusal of the honour he narrowly escaped with his life. Virginius died in the reign of Nerva , in his third consulship, A.D. 97, at eighty-three years of age. He was honoured with a public funeral, and his panegyric was pronounced by the historian Tacitus, who was then consul.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, father of the Roman emperor. He was a consummate flatterer, and by his arts gained promotion. After being consul in A.D. 34, he had been appointed governor of Syria, and had made favourable terms of peace with Artabanus. But all this only excited Caligula's jealousy, so that he sent for Vitellius to put him to death. The governor saved himself by his abject humiliation and the gross flattery which pleased and softened the savage tyrant. He paid similar court to 
<pb n="1664" /><cb /> Claudius and Messalina, and was rewarded by being twice consul with Claudius, and also censor (Dio Cass. lix. 27;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 11. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xi. 1</bibl>-3; xii. 42).</p>

His vices made him a favourite of Tiberius, Gaius Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who loaded him with <figure id="fig.01664">
<head orig="Vitellius. (Bust in Vienna.)">Vitellius. (Bust in Vienna.)</head>
</figure> favours. It caused great surprise, however, when Galba chose such a man to command the legions in Lower Germany, for he had little military talent. Both Upper and Lower Germany had been attached to Virginius Rufus, and disliked the rule of Galba; the two legions at Moguntiacum (Mayence) had not taken the oath of allegiance to him. Accordingly, they had already been disposed to find a nominee of their own, and when the news of Galba's death arrived, the legions of both Germanies combined to acknowledge Vitellius as Imperator, and he was proclaimed at Colonia Agrippinensis (Cologne) on the 2d of January, 69. His generals Fabius Valens and Caecina marched into Italy, defeated Otho's troops at the decisive battle of Betriacum, or Bedriacum, and thus secured for Vitellius the undisputed command of Italy. The soldiers of Otho, after his death, took the oath of fidelity to Vitellius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossotho">Otho</ref>.) Vitellius reached Rome in July. He disturbed no one in the enjoyment of what had been given by Nero, Galba, and Otho, nor did he confiscate any person's property; and though some of Otho's adherents were put to death, he let the next of kin take their possessions. Yet though he showed moderation in this part of his conduct, he showed none in his expenditure. He was a glutton and an epicure, and his chief amusement was the table, on which he spent enormous sums of money. Meantime Vespasian, who had at first taken the oath of allegiance to Vitellius, was proclaimed emperor at Alexandria on the 1st of July. Vespasian was speedily recognized by all the East; and the legions of Illyricum under <cb /> Antonius Primus entered the north of Italy and declared for Vespasian. Vitellius despatched Caecina with a powerful force to oppose Primus; but Caecina was not faithful to his master. Primus defeated the Vitellians in two battles, and afterwards took and pillaged the city of Cremona. Primus then marched upon Rome, and forced his way into the city, after much fighting. Vitellius was seized in the palace, led through the streets with every circumstance of ignominy, and dragged to the Gemoniae Scalae, where he was killed with repeated blows. His head was carried about Rome, and his body was thrown into the Tiber; but it was afterwards buried by his wife, Galeria Fundana. A few days before the death of Vitellius, the Capitol had been burned in the assault made by his soldiers upon this building, where Flavius Sabinus, the brother of the emperor Vespasian, had taken refuge ( <bibl n="Sal.

<head orig="Vitrum">Vitrum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὕαλος</foreign>). Glass. The Egyptians made glass at a very early period, the oldest existing specimen being a blue vase of opaque glass now in the British Museum, as old as the sixteenth century B.C. Cups and bottles of uncertain date have been taken in considerable numbers from the tombs and mummy-cases. In the paintings of Beni-Hassan (about 2300 B.C.) the process of glass-blowing is clearly depicted. The Assyrians likewise made admirable glass, the oldest existing specimen being a sort of bottle of green glass found at Nimroud, and dating from 719 B.C. It is now in the British Museum.</p>
 <p>A story has been preserved by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  191" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 191</bibl>) that glass was first discovered accidentally by some merchants who, having landed on the Syrian coast at the mouth of the river Belus, and being unable to find stones to support their cooking-pots, brought for this purpose from their ship some of the lumps of nitre which composed the cargo. This being fused by the heat of the fire, united with the sand upon which it rested and formed a stream of vitrified matter. The Phoenicians probably learned the art of glass-making from the Egyptians; but the tale is no doubt connected with the fact recorded by Strabo (xvi. p. 758) and Iosephus (<title>Bell. Iud.</title> ii. 9), that the sand of the district in question was esteemed peculiarly suitable for glass-making, and exported in great quantities to the workshops of Sidon, long the most famous in the ancient world. Alexandria, another centre of the industry, sustained its reputation for many centuries; Rome derived thence a great portion of its supplies, and as late as the reign of Aurelian we find the manufacture still flourishing ( <title>Pro Rabir. Post.</title> xiv. 40; Strabo, l. c.; Martial, xi. 11; xii. 74; xiv. 115; Vopisc. <title>Aurel.</title> 45).</p>
 <p>Homer does not certainly mention glass, but at Mycenae and Tiryns glass beads and other ornaments have been found. The words <foreign lang="greek">ὕαλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὕελος</foreign> in the early Greek writers (e. g. <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 24</bibl>) do not always refer to glass, but often to rockcrystal, rock-salt, amber, or alabaster; and it is not till Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, that the word is surely to be rendered “glass.” Of the Roman writers, Lucretius is the first to use the term <seg lang="la">vitrum</seg> (<bibl n="Lucr. 4.604" default="NO" valid="yes">iv. 604</bibl>; <bibl n="Lucr. 6.991" default="NO" valid="yes">vi. 991</bibl>), but it must have been known at Rome long before this time, as Cicero (l. c.) speaks of it as a common article of merchandise. Phoenician glass is found in the 
<pb n="1665" /><cb /> Etruscan cemeteries at Tarquinii dating from the eighth century B.C. Scaurus in his temporary theatre, erected in B.C. 58, used glass freely in the interior decoration (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>); and the Augustan poets often mention the substance (e. g.  <bibl n="Verg. G. 4. 350" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iv. 350</bibl>; <bibl n="Verg. A. 7. 759" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>vii. 759</bibl>; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

Carm. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 1</bibl>). Pliny states that glass was made in Italy, Gaul, and Spain, and that drinking-cups of glass had superseded those of gold and silver (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  192" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 192</bibl>-199). Under Alexander Severus we find the glass-makers (<seg lang="la">vitrearii</seg>) enumerated in the tax-lists with other artisans. Strabo notes the cheapness of glass, and says that a glass drinking-cup sold in his time for half an <hi rend="italic">as</hi>, or less than a cent.</p>
 <p>The following are the chief uses to which glass was applied:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Bottles, vases, cups, and urns for the ashes of the dead (<seg lang="la">cineraria</seg>). Of all of these great numbers exist, in a great variety of forms and colours, some having been blown into moulds so as to take the shape of—e. g. a bunch of grapes, a sea-shell, a negro's head, etc. (See illustration, s. v. <ref type="cross" target="crossdiatreta">Diatreta</ref>.) The finest of all under this class is the celebrated Portland Vase in the British Museum, found in the sixteenth century near Rome. See <ref type="cross" target="crossportland-vase">Portland Vase</ref>.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Glass pastes giving fac-similes of engraved precious stones. These were worn by those who could not afford real gems (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 48</bibl>). Precious stones were also imitated in glass with very great skill, so that only experts could detect the imposition. The sapphire, amethyst, carbuncle, and especially the emerald, were the oftenest counterfeited (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37. 197" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 197</bibl>; Trebell. Poll. <bibl n="App. Gall. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Gall.</title>12</bibl>; Seneca, <title>Epist.</title> 90; Isidor. <bibl n="Isid.

See <ref type="cross" target="crossgemma">Gemma</ref>.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) One very elegant application of glass deserves to be particularly noticed. A number of fine stalks of glass of different colours were placed vertically, and arranged in such a manner as to depict upon the upper surface some figure or pattern, upon the principle of a minute mosaic. The filaments thus combined were then subjected to such a degree of heat as would suffice to soften without melting them, and were thus cemented together into a solid mass. It is evident that the picture brought out upon the upper surface would extend down through the whole of the little column thus formed, and hence, if it was cut into thin slices at right angles to the direction of the fibres, each of these sections would upon both sides represent the design which would be multiplied to an extent in proportion to the total length of the glass threads. Further, if the column is heated and drawn out, the design becomes proportionately minute. When these sections have been again fused together side by side, the result is <hi rend="italic">millefiori</hi> glass. Many mosaic pavements and pictures (<seg lang="la">opus musivum</seg>) belong to this head, since the cubes were frequently composed of opaque glass as well as marble. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmusivum-opus">Musivum Opus</ref>.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) One method of decoration employed by the ancients consisted in enclosing designs in gold-leaf between two layers of transparent glass. This is most common from the third century A.D., when small Christian subjects are thus represented.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) Thick sheets of glass of various colours appear to have been laid down for paving floors, and to have been attached as a lining to the walls and ceilings of apartments in dwelling-houses, just as <cb /> <hi rend="italic">scagliola</hi> is frequently employed in Italy. Rooms fitted up in this way were called <seg lang="la">vitreae camerae</seg>, and the panels <seg lang="la">vitreae quadraturae.</seg> Such was the kind of decoration introduced by Scaurus for the scene of his theatre, not columns nor pillars of glass as some, nor bas-reliefs as others, have imagined (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  189" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 189</bibl>; <title>Sil.</title> i. 5, 42; Seneca, <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 76" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>76</bibl>; Vopisc. <title>Firm.</title> 3).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The question whether glass windows were known to the ancients has, after much discussion, been set at rest by the excavations at Pompeii, for not only have many fragments of flat glass been disinterred from time to time, but in the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> of the public baths a bronze lattice came to light with some of the panes still inserted in the frame, so as to determine at once not only their existence, but the mode in which they were secured and arranged (Mazois, <title>Ruines de Pompéi</title>, iii. p. 77).</p>
 <p>For the use of glass in mirrors, see <ref type="cross" target="crossspeculum">Speculum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The numerous specimens existing prove that the ancients were well acquainted with the art of imparting a great variety of colours to their glass; they were probably less successful in their attempts to render it perfectly pure and free from all colour, since we are told by Pliny that it was considered most valuable in this state. It was wrought according to the different methods now practised, being fashioned into the required shape by the blowpipe; or cut, as we term it, although “ground” (<seg lang="la">teritur</seg>) is a more accurate phrase, upon a wheel; or engraved with a sharp tool, like silver (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  193" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 193</bibl>). The process was difficult, and accidents occurred frequently ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 115" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 115</bibl>). The art of etching upon glass, now so common, was entirely unknown to the ancients, since it depends upon the properties of fluoric acid, a chemical discovery of the last century.</p>
 <p>Petronius and Dio Cassius assert that malleable glass was discovered in the reign of the emperor Tiberius. They tell a story of how a man demanded an interview with the emperor, and, on being admitted, showed him a glass vessel and then dashed it violently upon the ground. When taken up, it was neither broken nor cracked, but dinted like a piece of metal. The man then produced a mallet, and hammered it back into its original shape. The emperor inquired whether any one was acquainted with the secret, and was answered in the negative; upon which the order was given that the man should be instantly beheaded, lest the precious metals might lose their value, should such a composition become generally known.</p>

<head orig="Vitruvius Pollio">Vitruvius Pollio</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>. A celebrated Roman writer on architecture, of whom nothing is known except a few facts contained in scattered passages of his own work. He appears to have served as a military engineer under Iulius Caesar, in the African War (B.C. 46), and he was broken down with age when he composed his work, which is dedicated to the emperor Augustus. Though he usually speaks of the emperor as “Imperator” or “Caesar,” he employs also the title Augustus, which was adopted in B.C. 27, and he mentions (iii. 2, 7) the Temple of Quirinus, which was built 
<pb n="1666" /><cb /> B.C. 16; but he knows only one stone theatre at Rome (iii. 2, 2): whence it is inferred that the work was completed between B.C. 16 and B.C. 13, in which year two more stone theatres were built. He professes his intention to furnish the emperor with a standard by which to judge of the buildings he had already erected, as well as those which he might afterwards erect; which can have no meaning, unless he wished to protest against the style of architecture which prevailed in the buildings already erected. That this was really his intention appears from several other arguments, and especially from his frequent references to the unworthy means by which architects obtained wealth and favour, with which he contrasts his own moderation and contentment in his more obscure position. In a word, having apparently few great buildings of his own to point to as embodying his views (the basilica at Fanum is the only work of his which is mentioned), he desired to lay before the world in writing his principles of architecture. His work is a valuable compendium of those written by numerous Greek architects, whom he mentions chiefly in the preface to his seventh book, and by some Roman writers on architecture. Its chief defects are its brevity, of which Vitruvius himself boasts, and which he often carries so far as to be unintelligible, and the obscurity of the style, arising in part from the natural difficulty of technical language, but in part also from the author's want of skill in writing, and sometimes from his imperfect comprehension of his Greek authorities. His work is entitled <title>De Architectura Libri X.</title> In the first book, after the dedication to the emperor and a general description of the science of architecture and an account of the proper education of an architect, he treats of a choice of a proper site for a city, the disposition of its plan, its fortifications, and the several buildings within it. The second book is on the materials used in building. The third and fourth books are devoted to temples and the four orders of architecture employed in them, namely: the Ionic, Corinthian, Doric, and Tuscan. The fifth book relates to public buildings, the sixth to private houses, and the seventh to interior decorations. The eighth is on the subject of water: the mode of finding it; its different kinds; and the various modes for conveying it for the supply of cities. The ninth book treats of various kinds of sundials and other instruments for measuring time; and the tenth of the machines used in building, and of military engines. Each book has a preface, upon some matter more or less connected with the subject; and these prefaces are the source of most of our information about the author. The best editions of Vitruvius are those of Schneider, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1807-8)</bibl>; Stratico, 4 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Udine, 1825-30)</bibl>, with plates and a lexicon; Marini, 4 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1836)</bibl>, recently revised by Lorentzen; and of Rose and Müller-Strübing <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1867)</bibl>.

In consequence of possessing the two great ports of Luna and Populonia, Volaterrae, though so far inland, was reckoned as one of the powerful maritime cities of Etruria.

<head orig="Vulcānus">Vulcanus</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Volcānus</hi> (which is the earlier form of the word). The Italian god of fire. Vulcanus differed originally from Vesta in being the god rather of destructive fire than of the kindly hearth-fire; and it is probable that the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Vulcānal</hi> as one of the central sanctuaries in an Italian town (e.g. the altar and Area Vulcani in the Comitium at Rome) was originally a place for propitiatory offerings against destructive fire. In this way Vulcanus was connected with the goddess who stayed conflagrations (Stata Mater). That, however, in some places he was at one time also regarded as a god of the hearth-fire is indicated by the story of his son Caeculus (see <hi rend="SmallCaps">Caecus</hi>), and perhaps by that of Servius Tullius. But another primitive characteristic was his benign influence also as a god of summer heat, which led to his being paired with Maia, the goddess of spring or summer crops fostered by the sun ( <bibl n="Gel.  13. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii. 23</bibl>; Macrob. i. 12; Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 84); and in this aspect he may have been connected with the Italian Venus even before the Greek influence introduced this association from the analogy of Hephaestus and Aphrodité. As regards the connection of the Italian Vulcan with the smith's works of forging and melting, there is no clear evidence. It is asserted <cb /> that <ref type="cross" target="crossmulciber">Mulcĭber</ref>, a synonym of Vulcanus (and possibly once the name of another deity amalgamated or identified with him), represents this function of Vulcan, and is derived from <seg lang="la">mulcere</seg>, to soften metals; but this is by no means certain, and it is possible that the connection of Vulcanus (or Mulciber) with metal-work and the smithy is merely part of the transference to him of all the attributes of Hephaestus, with whom he is entirely identified in literature.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
<note id="ref3" target="n3">The power of the quaestors to fine is disputed by Mommsen. But even curatores could fine. (See Karlowa, Rechtsgeschichte, p. 171.)</note>
<note id="ref4" target="n4">* Very little is known of the architectural character of the early basilicas about the Forum.</note>
<note id="ref5" target="n5">* It is stated that there were but 136 gentes in existence when the Republic was established, and that the Senate was brought up to its normal strength (300) by the free selection of the balance. It is also stated that all, or at least a portion, of the senators thus selected were plebeians; but this seems merely an inference from the other statement, and is, of course, in no sense a necessary inference. Among modern writers the dispute turns largely on the interpretation of the phrase patres conscripti. Many hold that the patres were patricians, the conscripti plebeians. Others assert that the patres were those who sat as representatives of the gentes, and that the rest, whether patricians or plebeians, were conscripti. Others again deny that there was any distinction between patres and conscripti, and translate the phrase, “enrolled senators.”</note>
