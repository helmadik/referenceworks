 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαβακῶν</foreign>, Shabaka). A king of Aethiopia, who invaded Egypt in the reign of the blind king Anysis, whom he dethroned and drove into the marshes. The Aethiopian conqueror then reigned over Egypt for fifty years, but at length quitted the country in consequence of a dream, whereupon Anysis regained his kingdom. This is the account which Herodotus received from the priests (ii. 137- 140); but it appears from Manetho that there were three Aethiopian kings who reigned over Egypt, named Sabacon, Sebichus, and Taracus, whose collective reigns amount to forty or fifty years (B.C. 700-666), and who form the twenty-fifth dynasty of that writer. The account of Manetho is to be preferred to that of Herodotus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαβαῖοι</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Sabae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Σάβαι</foreign>) (O. T. Shebaiïm). One of the chief peoples of Arabia, dwelt in the southwest corner of the peninsula, in the most beautiful part of Arabia Felix, the north and centre of the province of El-Yemen. So at least Ptolemy places them (vi. 7, 23); but the fact seems to be that they are the chief representatives of a race which, at an early period, was widely spread on both sides of the southern part of the Red Sea, where Arabia and Aethiopia all but joined at the narrow strait of Bab-el-Mandeb; and hence, probably, the confusion often made between the Sheba and Seba of Scripture, or between the Shebaiim of Arabia and the Sebaiim of Aethiopia. Their country produced all the most precious spices and perfumes of Arabia. Their capital was Saba (Dio Cass. liii. 29).

His orgiastic worship was very closely connected with that of the Phrygian mother of the gods, Rhea-Cybelé, and of Attis. Along with this it was introduced into Athens in the fifth century B.C. ( <title>Vespae</title>, 9; <title>Lysistr.</title> 388; Demos. <title>De Cor.</title> 260). In later times it was widely spread in Rome and Italy, especially in the latter days of paganism. Like many of the Oriental deities, he represented the flourishing life of nature, which sinks in death, always to rise again. As an emblem 
<pb n="1393" /><cb /> of the yearly renovation of nature, the symbol specially appropriated to him was the snake. Accordingly, at the celebration of his mysteries, a golden snake was passed under the clothes and drawn over the bosom of the initiated (Clemens Alexandr. <title>Protrept.</title> p. 6). In the <title>Characteres</title> of Theophrastus, when the superstitious man “sees a serpent in his house, if it be the red snake, he will invoke Sabazius” (ch. 28, ed. Jebb).

She was first married to Rufius Crispinus, and afterwards to Otho, who was one of the boon companions of Nero. The latter <figure id="fig.01393">

Poppaea now became the acknowledged mistress of Nero, over whom she exercised absolute sway. Anxious to become the wife of the emperor, she persuaded Nero first to murder his mother Agrippina (59), who was opposed to such a disgraceful union, and next to divorce and shortly afterwards put to death his innocent and virtuous wife Octavia (62). She then became the wife of Nero. In 65 Poppaea, being pregnant, was killed by a kick from her brutal husband ( <bibl n="Suet. Nero 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 35</bibl>).

<div2 id="crosssacerdos" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sacerdos">Sacerdos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερεύς</foreign>). A priest; a person whose duty it was to perform certain rites associated with the relations existing between the State, or some organized body within the State, and the gods.</p>
 <p>In <ref type="cross" target="crossgreece">Greece</ref>, the word <foreign lang="greek">ἱερεύς</foreign> (fem. <foreign lang="greek">ἱέρεια</foreign>) is found as early as Homer, and denotes a person charged with definite and permanent religious duties— prayer, sacrifice, purification, or prophecy, or all of these combined. He was regularly associated with some special place of worship, as a temple or shrine, and was the minister of the god to whom the temple or shrine was dedicated (Pollux, i. 14). Priests, however, were not the only persons who exercised these functions, for we find them also performed by kings and magistrates, and also by heads of families and clans; so that it is evident that the priestly office had no exclusive right to the exercise of liturgical observances. They were, however, even in Homer's time, held in honour (v. 78), 
<pb n="1394" /><cb /> and even regarded as possessed of a species of divinity. Besides the name <foreign lang="greek">ἱερεύς</foreign>, Homer also uses the terms <foreign lang="greek">ἀρητήρ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">θυόσκοος</foreign>.</p>
 <p>In historic times, the priest was required to be a citizen of the State, so that in Athens no <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικος</foreign> could act as such; and if the worship were one peculiar to a family or clan, he must be a full member of it. Priestesses enjoyed some of the rights granted to male citizens—e. g. the right of pleading before the council, and of signing documents. They were usually women of rank and family. For both priests and priestesses, bodily purity was a requisite, and this not only a moral but a physical purity. The priest must not touch a dead body, and a death in the family of the priest sometimes served to forfeit the office, and always acted as a temporary disqualification. Some priesthoods could only be filled by virgins (Pausan. ii. 33, 3), while the priests of the Ephesian Artemis were eunuchs, and boy priests are also mentioned (<title>C. I. G.</title> 6206). There was, however, no general regulation as to age, nor was marriage prohibited by any general law. Priests were appointed sometimes by hereditary descent, as in the case of the Eumolpidae at Athens (<title>C. I. A.</title> ii. 410), sometimes by election (<title>C. I. G.</title> 2270, 18), and sometimes by purchase (<title>C. I. G.</title> 2656).</p>
 <p>The duties of a priest were partly administrative and partly liturgical. The first class of duties comprised the care of the temple, the regulation of the worshippers, and the management of the revenues. In keeping order he was assisted by officers like the modern vergers (<foreign lang="greek">ῥαβδοφόροι, κλειδοῦχοι, ζάκοροι, νεωκόροι</foreign>). (For the chief liturgic duties, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssacrificium">Sacrificium</ref>.) The privileges of a priest were special precedence, the use of a house, and a share of the perquisites arising from the sacrifices—e. g. specific portions of the victims (<title>C. I. A.</title> 610, 631), and fees, and also presents given by the worshippers ( <title>Plut.</title> 676). The dress of a priest was not, in general, especially distinctive, except for the wreath worn on the head while sacrificing. The hair was also, in some cases, worn long. In some special rites, however, an ornamental dress was worn, as at the Eleusinia and in the cult of the dead (Aesh. <title>Eumen.</title> 982). See <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>. On the frieze of the Parthenon, the priests appear in a long <hi rend="italic">chiton.</hi></p>
 <p>For various classes of Greek priests, see the articles <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosseumolpidae">Eumolpidae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshieropoei">Hieropoei</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssacrificium">Sacrificium;</ref> and compare the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossmysteria">Mysteria</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossoracula">Oracula</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossreligio">Religio</ref>.</p>
 <p>At <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Rome</ref>, in comparison with the civil magistrates, all priests were regarded as <seg lang="la">homines privati;</seg> though all of them, as priests, were sacerdotes publici, in so far as their office (<seg lang="la">sacerdotium</seg>) was connected with any worship recognized by the State. The appellation of <seg lang="la">sacerdos publicus</seg> was, however, given principally to the chief pontiff and the Flamen Dialis, who were at the same time the only priests who were members of the Senate by virtue of their office. All priestly offices or <seg lang="la">sacerdotia</seg> were held for life, without responsibility to any civil magistrate. A priest was generally allowed to hold any other civil or military office besides his priestly dignity. Some priests, however, formed an exception, for the Duumviri, the Rex Sacrorum, and the Flamen Dialis were not allowed to hold any State office, and were also exempt from service in the armies. Their priestly character was, generally speaking, inseparable from their <cb /> person as long as they lived; hence the augurs and Fratres Arvales retained their priestly character even when sent into exile, or when they were taken prisoners. It also occurs that one and the same person held two or three priestly offices at the same time. Thus we find the three dignities of Pontifex Maximus, augur, and Decemvir Sacrorum united in one individual. Bodily defects incapacitated a person at Rome, as among all ancient nations, from holding any priestly office. All priests were originally patricians, but from the year B.C. 367 the plebeians also began to take part in the sacerdotia (see <ref type="cross" target="crossplebs">Plebes</ref>); and those priestly offices which down to the latest times remained in the hands of the patricians alone, such as that of the Rex Sacrorum, the Flamines, Salii, and others, had no influence upon the affairs of the State.</p>
 <p>As regards the appointment of priests, the ancient writers unanimously state that at first they were appointed by the kings, but after the sacerdotia were once instituted, each college of priests —for nearly all priests constituted certain corporations called <seg lang="la">collegia</seg>—had the right of filling up, by <hi rend="italic">coöptatio</hi>, the vacancies which occurred. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspontifex">Pontifex</ref>.) Other priests, on the contrary, such as the Vestal Virgins and the Flamines, were appointed (<seg lang="la">capiebantur</seg>) by the Pontifex Maximus, a rule which appears to have been observed down to the latest times; others again, such as the Duumviri Sacrorum, were elected by the people, or by the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>, as, for example, the <seg lang="la">curiones.</seg> But in whatever manner they were appointed, all priests after their appointment required to be inaugurated by the pontiffs and the augurs, or by the latter alone. Those priests who formed colleges had originally, as we have already observed, the right of <hi rend="italic">coöptatio;</hi> but in the course of time they were deprived of this right, or at least the coöptatio was reduced to a mere form, by several laws, called <seg lang="la">leges de sacerdotiis</seg>, such as the Lex Domitia, Lex Cornelia, and Lex Iulia; their nature is described in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosspontifex">Pontifex</ref>, and what is there said in regard to the appointment of pontiffs applies equally to all the other colleges. All priests had some external distinction, as the <seg lang="la">apex, tutulus</seg>, or <seg lang="la">galerus</seg>, the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, as well as honorary seats in the theatre, circus, and amphitheatre. Most of the priestly colleges possessed landed property, and some priests had also a regular annual salary (<seg lang="la">stipendium</seg>), which was paid to them from the public treasury.

<head orig="Sacra">Sacra</head>

 <p> The Latin term for all transactions relating to the worship of the gods, especially sacrifice and prayer. They are either <seg lang="la">sacra privata</seg> or <seg lang="la">publica.</seg> The former were undertaken on behalf of the individual by himself, on behalf of the famly by the <seg lang="la">pater familias</seg>, or on behalf of the gens by the whole body of the gentiles. The centre of the domestic service of the gods is formed by the worship of the Penates and Lares. In particular cases recourse was also had to certain specified deities. Besides this, private sacra were attached to particular families; these passed to the heir with the succession and became a burden on him. Hence an inheritance without sacra (<seg lang="la">hereditas sine sacris</seg>) proverbially signified an unimpaired piece of good fortune (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 775" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Capt.</title>775</bibl>; <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 483" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Trin.</title>483</bibl>). As the family had sacra, so also had the <ref type="cross" target="crossgens">gens</ref> (q.v.), which had arisen out of the family by expansion. These were performed by a sacrificial priest (<seg lang="la">flamen</seg>) appointed from among the gentiles, the celebration taking place in his own house or in a special sacellum in the presence of the assembled gentiles. The <seg lang="la">sacra publica</seg> were undertaken <seg lang="la">pro populo</seg> collectively (1) by the <seg lang="la">curiae, pagi</seg>, or <seg lang="la">vici</seg>, into which the community was divided, whence such sacrifices were called <seg lang="la">sacra popularia;</seg> or</p>

 <p>(3) by the magistrates and priests of the Roman State. The sacra of the gentes were with few exceptions performed in public, though the multitude present remained silent spectators; only in a few cases did they take part in the procession to the place of worship or in the sacrificial feast.

The oath was taken first by the legates and tribunes. These officers then administered it to the soldiers in the following manner: one soldier in each legion recited the formula of the oath, and the rest were called up by name, and, coming forward one by one, swore to the same oath with the words <seg lang="la">idem in me</seg>—i. e. “the same (holds good) for me.” The oath remained in force only till the next campaign, and whenever there was a new general a new oath was taken. After the introduction of the twenty years' service by Marius (about B.C. 100), the men raised for service took the oath, not one by one, but all together and for the whole time of service, in the name of the State, afterwards in that of the emperor.</p>

<div2 id="crosssacrificium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sacrificium">Sacrificium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θυσία</foreign>). Sacrifices among the ancients formed the chief part of every religious act. According to the kind of sacrifice offered, they were divided into (1) bloodless offerings and</p>
 <p>(2) blood-offerings. The former consisted in firstfruits, viands, and cakes of various shape and make, which were some of them burned and some of them laid on the altars and sacrificial tables, and removed after a time; libations of wine, milk, water with honey or milk, and frankincense, for which in early times native products (wood and the berries of cedars, junipers, bay-trees, etc.) were used. Asiatic spices, such as incense and myrrh, scarcely came into use before the seventh century in Greece or until towards the end of the Republic at Rome.</p>
 <p>For blood-offerings cattle, goats, sheep, and swine were used by preference. Other animals were only employed in special cults. Thus horses were offered in certain Greek regions to Poseidon 
<pb n="1396" /><cb />
 and Helios, and at Rome on the occasion of the October feast to Mars; dogs to Hecaté and Robigus, asses to Priapus, cocks to Asclepius, and geese to Isis. Sheep and cattle, apparently, could be of<figure id="fig.01396">
<head orig="Sacrificial Attendant. (Roman relief.)">Sacrificial Attendant. (Roman relief.)</head>
</figure> fered to any gods among the Greeks. As regards swine and goats, the regulations varied according to the different regions. Swine were sacrificed especially to Demeter and Dionysus, goats to the last-named divinity and to Apollo and Artemis as well as to Aphrodité, while they were excluded from the service of Athené, and it was only at Sparta that they were presented to Heré. At Epidaurus they might not be sacrificed to Asclepius, though elsewhere this was done without scruple. Part of the spoils of the chase—such as the antlers or fell of the stag, or the head and feet of the boar or the bear—was offered to Artemis Agrotera.</p>
 <p>As regards the sex and colour of the victims, the Romans agreed in general with the Greeks in following the rule of sacrificing male creatures to gods, female to goddesses, and those of dark hue to the infernal powers. At Rome, however, there were special regulations respecting the victims appropriate to the different divinities. Thus the appropriate offering for Iupiter was a young steer of a white colour, or at least with a white spot on its forehead; for Mars, in the case of expiatory sacrifices, two bucks or a steer; the latter also for Neptune and Apollo; for Vulcan, a red calf and a boar; for Liber and Mercury, a he-goat; for Iuno, Minerva, and Diana, a heifer; for Iuno, as Lucina, a ewe lamb or (as also for Ceres and the Bona Dea) a sow; for Tellus, a pregnant, and for Proserpina a barren, heifer; and so on.</p>
 <p>The regulations as regards the condition of the victims were not the same everywhere in Greece. Still, in general with them, as invariably with the Romans, the rule held good that only beasts which were without blemish, and had not yet been used for labour, should be employed. Similarly, there were definite rules, which were, however, not the same everywhere, concerning the age of the victims. Thus, by Athenian law, lambs could not be offered at all before their first shearing, and sheep only when they had borne lambs. The Romans distinguished victims by their ages as <seg lang="la">lactantes</seg>, sucklings, and <seg lang="la">maiores</seg>, full grown. The sacrifice of sucklings was subject to certain limitations: young pigs had to be five days old, lambs seven, and calves thirty. Animals were reckoned <seg lang="la">maiores</seg> if they were <seg lang="la">bidentes</seg>—i. e. if their upper and lower rows of teeth were complete. There were exact requirements for all cases as regards their sex and condition, and to transgress these was an offence that demanded expiation. If the victims could not be obtained as the regulations required, the pontifical law allowed their place to be taken by a representation in wax or dough, or by a different animal in substitution for the sort required. In many cults different creatures were combined for sacrifice—e. g. a bull, a sheep, and a pig (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssuovetaurilia">Suovetaurilia</ref>), or a pig, a buck, and a ram, and the like. In State sacrifices victims were sometimes sacrificed in great numbers; <cb /> e. g. at the Athenian festival in commemoration of the victory at Marathon 500 goats were slain. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshecatombe">Hecatombé</ref>.) Human sacrifices as a means of expiation were not unknown to the earliest Greek and Roman worship, and continued in certain cases (e. g. at the feast of the Lycaean Zeus and of Iupiter Latiaris) until the imperial period. Where, however, they continued to exist, criminals who were in any case doomed to death were selected, and in many places opportunity was further given them for escape. As a rule, these human sacrifices gave way to symbolical exercises in which the rite either merely suggested the original form, or else for human victims effigies or puppets were substituted. Of the former kind was the symbolical whipping of the Spartan boys at the altar of Artemis Orthia till blood was drawn (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdiamastigosis">Diamastigosis</ref>); of the latter was the casting of puppets made of rushes into the Tiber in May (see <ref type="cross" target="crossargei">Argei</ref>), and the use of <seg lang="la">oscilla.</seg> See Pausan. ix. 8, 1; vii. 19, 2; Macrob. i. 7, 34; and Mannhardt, <title>Wald- und Feldkülte</title>, pp. 265 foll.</p>
 <p>In general, it was considered that purity in soul and body was an indispensable requirement for a sacrifice that was to be acceptable to a divinity. Accordingly, the celebrant washed at least his hands and feet, and appeared in clean (for the most part, white) robes. One who had incurred bloodguiltiness could not offer sacrifice at all; he who had polluted himself by touching anything unclean, particularly a corpse, needed special purification by fumigation. Precautions were also taken to insure the withdrawal of all persons who might be otherwise unpleasing to the divinity; from many sacrifices women were excluded; from others, men; from many, slaves and freedmen. At Rome, in early times, all plebeians were excluded by the patricians.</p>
 <p>The victims were generally decked out with ribbons and wreaths (<seg lang="la">infulae, vittae</seg>), and sometimes the cattle had their horns gilded. If the creature voluntarily followed to the altar or even bowed its head, this was considered as a favourable sign; it was an unfavourable sign if it offered resistance or tried to escape. In that case, with the Romans, the object of the sacrifice was deemed to be frustrated. Among the Greeks those who took part in the sacrifice wore wreaths; a firebrand from the altar was dipped in water, and with the water thus consecrated they sprinkled themselves and the altar. They then strewed the head of the victim with baked barley-grains, and cast some hairs cut from its head into the sacrificial fire. After those present had been called upon to observe a devout silence, and avoid everything that might mar the solemnity of the occasion, the gods were invited, amid the sound of flutes or hymns sung to the lyre and dancing, to accept the sacrifice propitiously. The hands of the worshippers were raised, or extended, or pointed downwards, according as the prayer was made to a god of heaven, of the sea, or of the lower world respectively. The victim was then felled to the ground with a mace or a hatchet, and its throat cut with the sacrificial knife. During this operation the animal's head was held up if the sacrifice belonged to the upper gods, and bowed down if it belonged to those of the lower world or the dead. The blood caught from it was, in the former case, poured round the altar; in the latter, into a ditch. In the case just mentioned 
<pb n="1397" /><cb /> the sacrifice was entirely burned (and this was also the rule with animals that were not edible), and the ashes were poured into the ditch. In sacrifices to the gods of the upper world, only certain portions were burned to the gods, such as thigh-bones or chine-bones cut off the victim, some of the entrails, or some pieces of flesh with a layer of fat, rolled round the whole, together with libations of wine and oil, frankincense, and sacrificial cakes. The remainder, after removing the god's portion, as it was called, for the priests engaged in the sacrifice, was either roasted at once for the sacrificial banquet and so consumed, or taken home. Festal sacrifices at the public expense were often combined with a public meal. Sacrifice was made to the gods of the upper air in the morning; to those of the lower world in the evening.</p>
 <p>Among the Romans, as among the Greeks, reverent silence prevailed during the sacrificial operations in case a careless word should become an evil omen, and to prevent any disturbance by external surroundings a flute-player played and the offerer of the sacrifice himself veiled his head during the rite. The prayer, formulated by the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi>, and unintelligible to the priests themselves from its archaic language ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  40" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 40</bibl>), was repeated by the votary after the priest, who read it from a written form, as any deviation from the exact words made the whole sacrifice of no avail. As a rule, the worshipper turned his face to the east, or, if the ceremony took place before the temple, to the image of the divinity, grasping the altar with his hands; and, when the prayer was ended, laid his hands on his lips, and turned himself from left to right (in many cults from right to left), or, again, walked round the altar and then seated himself. Then the victim (<seg lang="la">victima</seg> if a large one, <seg lang="la">hostia</seg> if a small one), selected as being without blemish, was consecrated, the priest sprinkling salted grains of dried and pounded spelt (<seg lang="la">mola salsa</seg>) and pouring wine from a cup upon its head, and also in certain sacrifices cutting some of the hairs off its head, and finally making a stroke with his knife along the back of the creature from its head to its tail. Cattle were killed with the mace, calves with the hammer, small animals with the knife, by the priest's attendants appointed for the purpose, to whom also the dissection of the victims was assigned. If the inspectors of sacrifice (see <ref type="cross" target="crossharuspex">Haruspex</ref>) declared that the entrails (<seg lang="la">exta</seg>), cut out with the knife, were not normal, this was a sign that the offering was not pleasing to the divinity; and if it was a male animal which had been previously slaughtered, a female was now killed. If the entrails again proved unfavourable, the sacrifice was regarded as of no avail. On the other hand, in the case of prodigies, sacrifices were offered until favourable signs appeared. In other sin-offerings there was no inspection of entrails. Sin-offerings were either entirely burned or given to the priests. Otherwise the flesh was eaten by the offerers, and only the entrails, which were roasted on spits, or boiled, were offered up, together with particular portions of the meat, in the proper way, and placed in a dish upon the altar, after being sprinkled with <seg lang="la">mola salsa</seg> and wine. The slaughter of the victim took place in the morning, while the <seg lang="la">exta</seg> were offered at evening, the intervening time being taken up by the process of preparation. See <cb /> A.

<head orig="Salii">Salii</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαλίοι</foreign>, “dancers,” from <seg lang="la">salio</seg>). An old Italian <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> of priests of Mars, said to have been introduced at Rome by Numa and doubled by Tullus Hostilius. The earlier college was called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Salii Palatīni</hi> and the later the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Salii Agonāles</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Collīni</hi>. The former derived their name from their <seg lang="la">curia</seg> on the Palatine Hill; the latter, from the Colline Gate, near which stood their sanctuary on the Quirinal. Both colleges consisted of twelve life-members of patrician family, and recruited their numbers from young men, whose parents were required to be still living; at their head was a <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, a <hi rend="italic">praesul</hi> (leader in the dance), and a <seg lang="la">vates</seg> (leader in the song). The cult of the Palatine Salii had to do with Mars, that of the Colline with Quirinus; but the chief connection of both was with the sacred shields, <seg lang="la">ancilia.</seg> (See illustration.) The chief ceremonial of the Salii was in March, the beginning of the campaigning season. On March 1st, they began a procession through the city, each of them dressed in an embroidered tunic, a bronze breastplate, and a peaked helmet, girt about with a sword, with one of the holy shields on the left arm, and in the right hand a staff, while trumpeters walked in front of them. <figure id="fig.01400">
<head orig="Salii with Ancilia. (Gruter.)">Salii with Ancilia. (Gruter.)</head>
</figure> At all the altars and temples they made a halt, and, under the conduct of the two leaders, danced the war-dance in three measures, from which they take their name of Salii or “dancers,” accompanying it by singing certain lays, beating their shields meanwhile with the staves. Every day the procession came to an end at certain appointed stations, where the shields were kept over the night in special houses, and the Salii themselves partook <cb /> of a meal proverbial for its magnificence ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 37</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 2</bibl>). Until March 24th the <seg lang="la">ancilia</seg> were in motion; within this time some special festivities were also held, in which the Salii took part. On March 11th there was a chariot-race in honour of Mars (<title>Equiria</title>) and a sacrificial feast in honour of the supposed fabricator of the shields, Mamurius Veturius; on the 19th was the ceremony of the cleansing of the shields, and on the 23d the cleansing of the holy trumpets (<seg lang="la">tubae</seg>) of the priests, called the <seg lang="la">tubilustrium.</seg> The days on which the <seg lang="la">ancilia</seg> were in motion were accounted solemn (<seg lang="la">religiosi</seg>), and on these days men avoided marching out to war, offering battle, and concluding a marriage. In October, the close of the campaigning season, the <seg lang="la">ancilia</seg> were once more brought out, in order to be cleansed in the Campus Martius. The lays of the Salii, called <seg lang="la">axamenta</seg> (from <hi rend="italic">axare</hi>, “to repeat,” a word found in Festus), were referred to Numa Pompilius, and were written in the archaic Saturnian verse, and in such primitive language, that they were scarcely intelligible even to the priests themselves, and as early as the beginning of the first century B.C. were the object of learned interpretation ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  40" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 40</bibl>). Two or three connected bits of these lays have come down to us. The most intelligible is the following, reconstructed by Bergk, in a rude Saturnian measure: <lb />| <title>Cumé tonás, Leucésie, | práe tét tremónti</title>, || <lb /><title>Quom tibeí cúneí | déxtumúm tonáront;</title> ||</p>
 <p>i. e. <title>Cum tonas, Lucetie</title> (thou god of light), <seg lang="la">prae te tremunt, cum tibi cunei</seg> (bolts of lightning) <seg lang="la">a dextra tonuerunt.</seg> (See Wordsworth, <title>Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin</title>, 564-566; Allen, <title>Early Latin</title>, p. 74). Besides Mars, other deities, such as Ianus, Iupiter, and Minerva, were invoked in them; the invocation of Mamurius Veturius formed the close (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, iii. 260 foll.). After the time of Augustus the names of individual emperors were also inserted in the lays.

On their return to Rome, both consuls were brought to trial on the charge of having unfairly divided the booty among the soldiers. Paulus escaped with difficulty, but Livius was condemned. The sentence seems to have been an unjust one, and Livius took his disgrace so much to heart that he left the city and retired to his estate in the country, where he lived some years without taking any part in public affairs (<bibl n="Liv.  22. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxii. 35</bibl>).

<head orig="Sallustius Crispus">Sallustius Crispus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>. (1) A famous Roman historian, belonging to a plebeian family. He was born B.C. 86, at Amiternum, in the country of the Sabines. He was quaestor about 59, and tribune of the plebs in 52, the year in which Clodius was killed by Milo. In his tribunate he joined the popular party, and took an active part in opposing Milo. It is said that he had been caught by Milo in the act of adultery with his wife Fausta, the daughter of the dictator Sulla ; that he had received a beating from the husband; and that he had been only let off on payment of a sum of money. In 50 Sallust was expelled from the Senate by the censors, probably because he belonged to Caesar's party, though some give as the ground of his ejection from the Senate the act of adultery already mentioned. In the Civil War he followed Caesar's fortunes. In 47 we find him praetor elect, by obtaining which dignity he was restored to his rank. He nearly lost his life in a mutiny of some of Caesar's troops in Campania, who had been led thither to pass over into Africa. He accompanied Caesar in his African war (46), and was left by Caesar as governor of Numidia, in which capacity he is charged with having oppressed the people, and enriched himself by unjust means. He was accused of maladministration before Caesar, but it does not appear that he was brought to trial. The <cb /> charge is somewhat confirmed by the fact of his becoming immensely rich, as was shown by the expensive gardens which he formed (<title>horti Sallustiani</title>) on the Quirinalis. He retired into privacy after he returned from Africa, and he passed quietly through the troublesome period after Caesar's death. He died in the year 34, about four years before the battle of Actium. The story of his marrying Cicero's wife, Terentia, ought to be rejected.</p>
 <p>It was probably not till after his return from Africa that Sallust wrote his historical works. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <title>Catilina</title>, or <title>Bellum Catilinarium</title>, is a history of the conspiracy of Catiline during the consulship of Cicero, 63. The introduction to this history, which some critics admire, is only a feeble and rhetorical attempt to act the philosopher and moralist. The history, however, is valuable. Sallust was a living spectator of the events which he describes, and considering that he was not a friend of Cicero, and was a partisan of Caesar, he wrote with fairness. The speeches which he has inserted <figure id="fig.01401">
<head orig="Bust of Sallust. (St. Petersburg.)">Bust of Sallust. (St. Petersburg.)</head>

It is probable that Sallust was led to write this work from having resided in Africa, and that he collected some materials there. He cites the Punic Books of King Hiempsal, as authority for his general geographical description (<title>Iug.</title> 17). The Jugurthine War has a philosophical introduction of the same stamp as that to the <title>Catilina.</title> As a history of the campaign, the Jugurthine War is of no value: there is a total neglect of geographical precision, and apparently not a very strict regard to chronology. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Sallustius also wrote <title>Historiarum Libri Quinque</title>, which were dedicated to Lucullus, 
<pb n="1402" /><cb /> a son of L. Licinius Lucullus. The work is supposed to have comprised the period from the consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus (78), the year of Sulla 's death, to the consulship of L. Vulcatius Tullus and M. Aemilius Lepidus (66), the year in which Cicero was praetor. This work is lost, with the exception of fragments which have been collected and arranged. They contain, among other things, several orations and letters. Some fragments belonging to the third book, and relating to the war with Spartacus, have been published from a Vatican MS. in the present century, and a number of others were found in 1886 by Hauler in an Orleans palimpsest. <title>(d) Duae Epistolae de Re Publica Ordinanda</title>, which appear to be addressed to Caesar at the time when he was engaged in his Spanish campaign (49) against Petreius and Afranius, and are attributed to Sallust; but the opinions of critics on their authenticity are divided. (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) The <title>Declamatio in Sallustium</title>, which is attributed to Cicero, is generally admitted to be the work of some rhetorician, the matter of which is the well-known hostility between the orator and the historian.

 <p>Some of the Roman writers considered that Sallustius imitated the style of Thucydides ( <bibl n="Quint.  10. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. 1</bibl>), and he has himself greatly influenced the style of Tacitus. His language is generally concise and perspicuous: perhaps his love of brevity may have caused the ambiguity that is sometimes found in his sentences. He also affected archaic words. Though he has considerable merit as a writer, his art is always apparent. He had no pretensions to great research or precision about facts. His reflections have often something of the same artificial and constrained character as his expressions. One may judge that his object was to obtain distinction as a writer; that style was what he thought of more than matter. He has, however, probably the merit of being the first Roman who wrote what is usually called history. He was not above his contemporaries as a politician; he was a party man, and there are no indications of any comprehensive views, which had a whole nation for their object. He hated the nobility, and depicted their vices in a spirit of bitter exaggeration.</p>
 <p>There are many MSS. of Sallust, especially at Paris. These Codices Parisini, of the tenth and eleventh centuries (P, P<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>, P<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>), are the best, all being distinguished by a lengthy lacuna after <title>Iug.</title> 103, supplied from a second “family” of MSS. written later, and represented by several codices at Munich. Remains of the orations and letters of Sallust are preserved in two MSS. of the tenth century—one at Berne, and one in the Vatican. These give also annotations by an unknown grammarian.</p>

<head orig="Saltatio">Saltatio</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὄρχησις, χόρευσις</foreign>). Dancing. The dancing of the Greeks and Romans had little in common with the exercise which goes by that name in modern times. It may be divided into two kinds, gymnastic and mimetic; that is, it was intended either to represent bodily activity, or to express by gestures, movements, and attitudes certain ideas or feelings, and also single events or a series of events, as in the modern ballet. All these movements, however, were accompanied by music; but the terms <foreign lang="greek">ὄρχησις</foreign> and <seg lang="la">saltatio</seg> were used in so much wider a sense than our word dancing that they were applied to designate gestures even when the body did not move at all (<seg lang="la">saltare solis oculis</seg>,  <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10." default="NO" valid="yes">Ov. <title>Met.</title>x.</bibl> p. 251).</p>
 <p>We find dancing prevalent among the Greeks from the earliest times. It is frequently mentioned in the Homeric poems: the suitors of Penelopé delight themselves with music and dancing (<title>Odyss.</title> i. 152); and Odysseus is entertained at the court of Alcinoüs with the exhibitions of very skilful dancers, the rapid movements of whose feet excite his admiration (<title>Odyss.</title> viii. 265). Skilful dancers were at all times highly prized by the Greeks: we read of some who were presented with golden crowns, and had statues erected to their honour, and their memory celebrated by inscriptions. 
<pb n="1404" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The lively imagination and mimetic powers of the Greeks found abundant subjects for various kinds of dances, and, accordingly, the names of no less than two hundred different dances have come down to us. It would be inconsistent with the nature of this work to give a description of all that are known: only the most important can be mentioned, and such as will give a general idea of the dancing of the ancients.</p>
 <p>Dancing was originally closely connected with religion. Plato thought all dancing should be based on religion, as it was, he says, among the Egyptians. It has been shown under <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref> that the chorus in the oldest times consisted of the whole population of a city, who met in a public place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of their country by singing hymns and performing dances. These dances, which, like all others, were accompanied by music, were therefore of a strictly religious nature; and in all the public festivals, which were so numerous among the Greeks, dancing formed a very prominent part. We find, from the earliest times, that the worship of Apollo was connected with a religious dance called <ref type="cross" target="crosshyporchema">Hyporchema</ref> (q.v.). All the religious dances, with the exception of the Bacchic and the Corybantian, were very simple, and consisted of gentle movements of the body, with various turnings and windings around the altar: such a dance was the <foreign lang="greek">γέρανος</foreign>, which Theseus is said to have performed at Delos on his return from Crete. The Dionysiac or Bacchic and the Corybantian were of a very different nature. In the former, the life and adventures of the god were represented by mimetic dancing (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>); the dance called <foreign lang="greek">Βακχική</foreign> was a satyric dance, and chiefly prevailed in Ionia and Pontus; the most illustrious men in the State danced in it, representing Titans, Corybantians, satyrs, and husbandmen, and the spectators were so delighted with the exhibition that they remained sitting the whole day to witness it, forgetful of everything else. The Corybantian was of a very wild character: it was chiefly danced in Phrygia and in Crete: the dancers were armed, struck their swords against their shields, and displayed the most extravagant fury; it was accompanied chiefly by the flute. The following wood-cut, from the Museo Pio-Clementino, is supposed to represent a Corybantian dance. Respecting the dances in the theatre, see <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>. <figure id="fig.01404">

 <p>Dancing was applied to gymnastic purposes and to training for war, especially in the Doric States, and was believed to have contributed very much to the success of the Dorians in war, as it enabled them to perform their evolutions simultaneously and in order.</p>
 <p>There were various dances in early times which served as a preparation for war; hence Homer calls the hoplitae <foreign lang="greek">πρυλέες</foreign>, a war-dance having been called <foreign lang="greek">πρύλις</foreign> by the Cretans. Of such dances the most celebrated was the Pyrrhic (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Πυρρίχη</foreign>), <cb /> of which the <foreign lang="greek">πρύλις</foreign> was probably only another name.</p>
 <p>The invention of this dance is placed in the mythical age, and is usually assigned to one Pyrrhicos; but most of the accounts agree in assigning it a Cretan or Spartan origin, though others refer it to Pyrrhus or Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, apparently misled by the name, for it was undoubtedly of Doric origin. It was danced to the sound of the flute, and its time was very quick and light, as is shown by the name of the Pyrrhic foot (˘˘), which must be connected with this dance: and from the same source came also the Proceleusmatic (˘˘˘˘), or challenging foot. The Pyrrhic dance was performed in different ways at various times and in various countries, for it was by no means confined to the Doric States. Plato describes it as representing, by rapid movements of the body, the way in which missiles and blows from weapons were avoided, and also the mode in which the enemy was attacked. In the non-Doric States it was probably not practised as a training for war, but only as a mimetic dance: thus we read of its being danced by women to entertain a company. It was also performed at Athens at the greater and lesser Panathenaea by Ephebi, who were called Pyrrhichists (<foreign lang="greek">Πυρριχισταί</foreign>), and were trained at the expense of the choragus.</p>
 <p>The following illustration, taken from Sir W. Hamilton's vases, represents three Pyrrhichists, two of whom, with sword and shield, are engaged in the dance, while the third is standing with a sword. Above them is a female balancing herself on the <figure id="fig.01404.2">

A woman spectator, sitting, looks on at the exhibition.</p>
 <p>The Pyrrhic dance was introduced into the public games at Rome by Iulius Caesar, when it was danced by the children of the leading men in Asia and Bithynia. It seems to have been much liked by the Romans; it was exhibited both by Caligula and Nero, and also frequently by Hadrian. Athenaeus says that the Pyrrhic dance was still practised in his time (the third century A.D.) at Sparta.</p>
 <p>Other kinds of dances were frequently performed at entertainments, in Rome as well as in Greece, by courtesans, many of which were of a very indecent and lascivious nature (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 10" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 10</bibl>;

The dancers seem to have frequently represented Bacchanals; many such dancers appear in the paintings found at Herculaneum and Pompeii in a variety of graceful attitudes. (<title>Museo Borbonico</title>, vol. vii. tav. 34-40; vol. ix. tav. 17; vol. x. tav. 5, 6, 54.)</p>
 <p>Among the dances performed without arms one of the most important was the <foreign lang="greek">ὅρμος</foreign>, which was danced at Sparta by youths and maidens together: the youth danced first some movements suited to his age, and of a military nature; the maiden followed in measured steps and with feminine gestures. Another common dance at Sparta was the <title>Bibasis</title> (<foreign lang="greek">βίβασις</foreign>), which was much practised both by men and women. The dance consisted in springing rapidly from the ground, and striking the feet behind; a feat of which a Spartan woman in Aristophanes (<title>Lysistr.</title> 28) prides herself. The number of successful strokes was counted, and the most skilful received prizes. We are told by a verse which has been preserved by Pollux (iv. 102), that a Laconian girl had danced the <hi rend="italic">bibasis</hi> a thousand <figure id="fig.01405.2">
<head orig="Acrobatic Dancer (Museo Borbonico.)">Acrobatic Dancer (Museo Borbonico.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> times, which was more than had ever been done before.</p>
 <p>In many of the Greek States the art of dancing was carried to great perfection by females, who were frequently engaged to add to the pleasures and enjoyment of men at their symposia. These dancers always belonged to the courtesans. Xenophon ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 9. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>ix. 2</bibl>-7) describes a mimetic dance which was represented at a symposium where Socrates was present. It was performed by a maiden and a youth, belonging to a Syracusan, who is called the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχηστοδιδάσκαλος</foreign>, and represented the loves of Dionysus and Ariadné.</p>
 <p>Dancing was common among the Romans in ancient times in connection with religious festivals and rites, and was practised, according to Servius (<seg lang="la">ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 5. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>v. 73</bibl>), because the ancients thought that no part of the body should be free from the influence of religion. The dances of the Salii, which were performed by men of patrician families, are spoken of elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssalii">Salii</ref>.) There was another old Roman dance of a military nature, called <seg lang="la">bellicrepa saltatio</seg>, which is said to have been instituted by Romulus, after he had carried off the Sabine women, in order that a like misfortune might not befall his State (Festus, <hi rend="italic">s. v.</hi>). Dancing, however, was not performed by any Roman citizen except in connection with religion; and it is only in reference to such dancing that we are to understand the statements that the ancient Romans did not consider dancing disgraceful, and that not only freemen but the sons of senators and noble matrons practised it (Quintil. <title>Inst. Orat.</title> i. 11, 18). In the later times of the Republic we know that it was considered highly disgraceful for a freeman to dance: Cicero reproaches Cato for calling Murena a dancer (<seg lang="la">saltator</seg>), and adds, “Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit” (<title>Pro Muren.</title> 6, 13; <title>In Pison.</title> 10, 22). The professional dancing-girls at Rome came from foreign countries, oftenest from Spain; and those of Gades (Cadiz) were especially noted for the indecent suggestiveness of their performances.</p>

 <p> A Roman goddess, the personification of health, prosperity, and the public welfare.

In the second sense she represents prosperity in general. In the third sense she is the goddess of the public welfare (Salus publica or Romana). In this capacity a temple was vowed to her in the year B.C. 307 by the censor C. Iunius Bubulcus, on the Quirinal Hill, which was afterwards decorated with paintings by C. Fabius Pictor. She was worshipped publicly on the 30th of April, in conjunction with Pax, Concordia, and Ianus. Salus was represented, like

<head orig="Samarīa">Samaria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαμάρεια</foreign>; Hebr. <title>Shomron</title>). (1) A district of Palestine extending along the coast from near Caesarea to Joppa on the south. (See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Palestina</hi>.)</p>
 <p>(2) An important city of Palestine on a line west of the Jordan River. It was founded by Omri, King of Israel, in the tenth century B.C., and was the capital of the Israelites until taken by Shalmaneser of Assyria, about B.C. 720. When the Jews returned from the Babylonian captivity, those of the Samaritans who worshipped Jehovah offered to assist them in rebuilding the temple at Jerusalem; but their aid was refused, and hence arose the lasting hatred between the Jews and the Samaritans. This religious animosity reached its height when, in the reign of Darius Nothus, the son of the Jewish high-priest, having married the daughter of Sanballat, governor of Samaria, went over to the Samaritans and became high-priest of a temple which his father-in-law built for him, on Mount Gerizim, near Sichem. The erection of this temple had also the effect of diminishing the importance of the city of Samaria. Under the Syrian kings and the Maccabean princes, we find the name of Samaria used distinctly as that of a province, which consisted of the district between Galilee on the north and Judaea on the south. Samaria was taken by Alexander the Great, by Ptolemy I. (B.C. 312), and by Demetrius Poliorcetes (B.C. 276). In the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, the Samaritans escaped by conforming to the king's edicts and dedicating the temple on Mount Gerizim to Zeus Hellenius (B.C. 167). As the power of the Asmonean princes increased, they attacked <cb /> the Samaritans; and, about B.C. 110, the Jewish leader John Hyrcanus took and destroyed the temple on Mount Gerizim and the city of Samaria. The latter seems to have been soon rebuilt. Pompey assigned the district to the province of Syria, and Gabinius fortified the city anew. Augustus gave the district to Herod, who greatly renovated the city of Samaria, which he called Sebasté in honour of his patron. By the fourth century A.D. Samaria had ceased to be a place of any importance. There still exist remains of a basilica of the time of Herod, and of a Roman temple. See <bibl default="NO">Appel, <title>De Reb.

<head orig="Samnium">Samnium</head>

 <p> (<title>Sabnium</title> qs. <title>Sabinium</title>). A country in the centre of Italy, bounded on the north by the Marsi, Peligni, and Marrucini, on the west by Latium and Campania, on the south by Lucania, and on the east by the Frentani and Apulia. The Samnites were an offshoot of the Sabines, who emigrated from their country between the Nar, the Tiber, and the Anio, before the foundation of Rome, and settled in the country afterwards called Samnium. This country was at the time of their migration inhabited by Opicans, whom the Samnites conquered, and whose language they adopted; for we find at a later time that the Samnites spoke Opican or Oscan. See <ref type="cross" target="crossosci">Osci</ref>.</p>
 <p>Samnium is a country marked by striking physical features. The greater part of it is occupied by a huge mass of mountains, called at the present day the Matese, which stands out from the central line of the Apennines. The circumference of the Matese is between seventy and eighty miles, and its greatest height is 6000 feet. The most important tribes 
<pb n="1407" /><cb /> of the Samnites were the Caudini and Pentri, of whom the former occupied the south side and the latter the north side of the Matese. To the Caudini belonged the towns of Allifae, Telesia, and Beneventum; to the Pentri, those of Aesernia, Bovianum, and Sepinum. Besides these chief tribes, we find mention of the Caraceni, who dwelt north of the Pentri, and to whom the town of Aufidena belonged; and of the Hirpini, who dwelt southeast of the Caudini, but who are sometimes mentioned as distinct from the Samnites.</p>
 <p>The Samnites were distinguished for their bravery and love of freedom. Issuing from their mountain fastnesses, they overran a great part of Campania; and it was in consequence of Capua applying to the Romans for assistance against the Samnites that war broke out between the two peoples in B.C. 343. The Romans found the Samnites the most warlike and formidable enemies whom they had yet encountered in Italy; and the war, which commenced in B.C. 343, was continued with few interruptions for the space of fifty-three years. It was not till B.C. 290, when all their bravest troops had fallen, and their country had been repeatedly ravaged in every direction by the Roman legions, that the Samnites sued for peace and submitted to the supremacy of Rome. They never, however, lost their love of freedom; and accordingly they not only joined the other Italian allies in the war against Rome in B.C. 90, but, even after the other allies had submitted, they continued in arms. The Civil War between Marius and Sulla gave them hopes of recovering their independence; but they were defeated by Sulla before the gates of Rome (82) the greater part of their troops fell in battle, and the remainder were put to death. Their towns were laid waste, the inhabitants sold as slaves, and their place supplied by Roman colonists.

<head orig="Samos">Samos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σάμος</foreign>). Now Samo, Turk. Susam Adassi; one of the principal islands of the Aegaean Sea, lying in that portion of it called the Icarian Sea, off the coast of Ionia, from which it is separated only by a narrow strait formed by the overlapping of its eastern promontory Posidium (now Cape Colonna) with the westernmost spur of Mount Mycalé, Promontorium Trogilium (now Cape S. Maria). This strait, which is little more than three-fourths of a mile wide, was the scene of the battle of Mycalé. The island is formed by a range of mountains extending from east to west, whence it derived its name; for <foreign lang="greek">Σάμος</foreign> was an old Greek word signifying a mountain: and the same root is seen in Samé, the old name of Cephallenia, and Samothracé—i. e. the Thracian Samos. The circumference of the island is about eighty miles. It was and is very fertile; and some of its products are indicated by its ancient names, Dryusa, Anthemura, Melamphyllus, and Cyparissia. According to the earliest traditions, it was a chief seat of the Carians and Leleges, and the residence of their first king, Ancaeus; and was afterwards colonized by Aeolians from Lesbos, and by Ionians from Epidaurus.</p>
 <p>In the earliest historical records, we find Samos decidedly Ionian, and a powerful member of the Ionic Confederacy. Thucydides tells us that the Samians were the first of the Greeks, after the Corinthians, who paid great attention to naval affairs. They early acquired such power at sea, that, besides obtaining possession of parts of the <cb /> opposite coast of Asia, they founded many colonies, among which were Bisanthé and Perinthus, in Thrace; Celenderis and Nagidus, in Cilicia; Cydonia, in Crete; Dicaearchia (Puteoli), in Italy; and Zanclé (Messana), in Sicily. After a transition from the state of a monarchy, through an aristocracy, to a democracy, the island became subject to the most famous of the so-called “tyrants,” Polycrates (B.C. 532), under whom its power and splendour reached their highest pitch, and Samos would probably have become the mistress of the Aegaean but for the murder of Polycrates. At this period the Samians had extensive commercial relations <figure id="fig.01407">
<head orig="Coin of Samos.">Coin of Samos.</head>
</figure> with Egypt, and they obtained from Amasis the privilege of a separate temple at Naucratis. Their commerce extended into the interior of Africa, partly through their relations with Cyrené, and also by means of a settlement which they effected in one of the Oases, seven days' journey from Thebes. The Samians now became subject to the Persian Empire, under which they were governed by tyrants, with a brief interval at the time of the Ionian revolt, until the battle of Mycalé, which made them independent, B.C. 479. They now joined the Athenian Confederacy, of which they continued independent members until B.C. 440, when an opportunity arose for reducing them to entire subjection and depriving them of their fleet, which was effected by Pericles after an obstinate resistance of nine months' duration. In the <ref type="cross" target="crosspeloponnesian-war">Peloponnesian War</ref> (q.v.), Samos held firm to Athens to the last; and in the history of the latter part of that war, the island becomes extremely important as the headquarters of the exiled democratical party of the Athenians. Transferred to Sparta after the battle of Aegospotami (405), it was soon restored to Athens by that of Cnidus (394), but went over to Sparta again in 390. Soon after, it fell into the hands of the Persians, being conquered by the satrap Tigranes; but it was recovered by Timotheus for Athens. In the Social War, the Athenians successfully defended it against the attacks of the confederated Chians, Rhodians, and Byzantines, and placed in it a body of two thousand <hi rend="italic">cleruchi</hi> (B.C. 352). After Alexander's death, it was taken from the Athenians by Perdiccas (323), but restored to them by Polysperchon (319). In the subsequent period, it seems to have been rather nominally than really a part of the Graeco-Syrian kingdom: we find it engaged in a long contest with Priené on a question of boundary, which was referred to Antiochus II., and afterwards to the Roman Senate. In the Macedonian War, Samos was taken by the Rhodians again, B.C. 200. In the Syrian War, the Samians took part with Antiochus the Great against Rome.</p>
 <p>Little further mention is made of Samos till the time of Mithridates, with whom it took part in his first war against Rome, on the conclusion of which it was finally united to the province of Asia, B.C. 84. 
<pb n="1408" /><cb /> Meanwhile it had greatly declined, and during the war it had been wasted by the incursions of pirates. Its prosperity was partially restored under the propraetorship of Q. Cicero, B.C. 62, but still more by the residence in it of Antony and Cleopatra (32), and afterwards of Octavianus, who made Samos a free State. It was favoured by Caligula, but was deprived of its freedom by Vespasian, and it sank into insignificance as early as the second century, although its departed glory is found still recorded, under the emperor Decius, by the inscription on its coins, <foreign lang="greek">Σαμίων πρώτων Ιωνίας</foreign>.</p>
 <p>Samos may be regarded as almost the chief centre of Ionian manners, energies, luxury, science, and art. In very early times there was a native school of statuary, at the head of which was Rhoecus, to whom tradition ascribed the invention of casting in metal. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossstatuaria-ars">Statuaria Ars</ref>.) In the hands of the same school architecture flourished greatly; the Heraeum, one of the finest of Greek temples, was erected in a marsh, on the western side of the city of Samos; and the city itself, especially under the government of Polycrates, was furnished with other splendid works, among which was an aqueduct pierced through a mountain. Samain architects became famous also beyond their own island; as, for example, Mandrocles, who constructed Darius's bridge over the Bosporus. Samian pottery was well known, and was in vogue in Greece and Italy in the second century B.C., and was imitated by the potters of Gaul and Britain. It was of a reddish colour, with reliefs. The island was the birthplace of Pythagoras ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 95" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 95</bibl>), and of several minor poets and historians.</p>
 <p>The capital of the island was the city <ref type="cross" target="crosssamos">Samos</ref>, on the southeastern coast. It had a magnificent harbour, and was adorned with many fine buildings, especially a temple of Heré (Heraeum), which in the time of Herodotus was the largest temple in existence ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 60</bibl>; Pausan. vii. 4). It was of the Ionic order. Excavations made in 1880 show that its façade was one of some 150 feet.</p>

The Samothracians fought on the side of Xerxes at the battle of Salamis; and at this time they possessed on the Thracian mainland a few places, such as Salé, Serrhion, Mesambria, and Tempyra. In the time of the Macedonian kings, Samothracé appears to have been regarded as a kind of asylum, and Perseus accordingly fled thither after his defeat by the Romans at the battle of Pydna. <cb />

On account of many points of resemblance he was identified with Hercules.

<head orig="Sappho. (From the painting by Alma-Tadema.)">Sappho. (From the painting by Alma-Tadema.)</head>
</figure> two great leaders of the Aeolian school of lyric poetry, Alcaeus being the other. She was a native of Mitylené, or, as some said, of Eresos in Lesbos, and flourished towards the end of the seventh century B.C. Her father's name was Scamandronymus, who died when she was only six years old. She had three brothers, Charaxus, Larichus, and Eurigius. Charaxus was violently upbraided by his sister in a poem, because he became so enamoured of the courtesan Rhodopis at Naucratis in Egypt as to ransom her from slavery at an immense price. Sappho was contemporary with Alcaeus, Stesichorus, and Pittacus. That she was not only contemporary, but lived in friendly intercourse, with Alcaeus is shown by existing fragments of the poetry of both. Of the events of her life we have no other information than an obscure allusion in the Parian Marble and in Ovid ( <bibl n="Eur. Her. 15. 51" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Her.</title>xv. 51</bibl>) to her flight from Mitylené to Sicily to escape some unknown 
<pb n="1410" /><cb /> danger, between B.C. 604 and 592; and the common story that being in love with Phaon, and finding her love unrequited, she leaped down from the Leucadian Rock. This story, however, seems to have been an invention of later times. The name of Phaon does not occur in one of Sappho's fragments, and there is no evidence that he was mentioned in her poems. As for the leap from the Leucadian Rock, it is a mere metaphor, taken from an expiatory rite connected with the worship of Apollo, which seems to have been a frequent poetical image. At Mitylené Sappho appears to have been the leader of a feminine literary set, most of the members of which were her pupils in poetry, fashion, and gallantry, so that from this association later writers have attempted to prove that the moral character of Sappho was not free from all reproach; and it is difficult to read the fragments which remain of her verse without being forced to come to the conclusion that a woman who could write such poetry could not be the pure woman that her modern apologists would have her. (See the defence of Sappho by Welcker [1816] and the various papers in the <title>Rheinisches Museum</title> for 1857-58.) Of her poetical genius, however, there cannot be a question. The ancient writers agree in expressing the most unbounded admiration for the passion, sincerity, and grace of her poetry. Already in her own age the recitation of one of her poems so affected Solon that he expressed an earnest desire to learn it before he died. Her lyric poems formed nine books, but of these only fragments have come down to us. The most important is a splendid ode to Aphrodité, of which we perhaps possess the whole. The best editions of the fragments is by Neue <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1827)</bibl>, and that in Bergk's <title>Poet. Lyrici Graeci</title>, vol. iii. <bibl default="NO">(4th ed. 1882)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαρδανάπαλος</foreign>). The last king who reigned over the Assyrian Empire of Nineveh. The account given of him by Ctesias asserts that he passed his time in his palace unseen by any of his subjects, dressed in woman's apparel, and surrounded by concubines. At length Arbaces, satrap of Media, and Beletys, the noblest of the Chaldaean priests, resolved to renounce allegiance to such a monarch, and advanced at the head of a formidable army against Nineveh. But all of a sudden the effeminate prince threw off his luxurious habits and appeared an undaunted warrior. Placing himself at the head of his troops, he twice defeated the rebels, but was at length worsted and obliged to shut himself up in Nineveh. Here he sustained a siege for two years, until at length, finding it impossible to hold out any longer, he collected all his treasures, wives, and concubines, and placing them on an immense pile which he had constructed, set it on fire, and thus destroyed both himself and them. The enemies then obtained possession of the city. This is the account of Ctesias, which has been preserved by Diodorus Siculus and which has been followed by most subsequent writers and chronologists (see <bibl n="Diod.  2. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.ii. 21</bibl>; Syncell. p. 359; <title>C. D.</title> xviii. 21), and has been taken as the subject of a very spirited dramatic fragment by Lord Byron entitled <title>Sardanapalus.</title> The death of Sardanapalus and the fall of the Assyrian Empire were placed B.C. 876. Modern writers however have shown that the whole narrative of Ctesias is mythical, and must not be received as genuine history. It is contradicted by the statements in Herodotus and the Christian writers. Sardanapalus is to be identified with the King Ashurbanipal, of whom many cuneiform records survive, and who made two successful expeditions against Egypt 
<pb n="1411" /><cb /> (B.C. 670-650); but was defeated in B.C. 646, when Cyaxares, King of Media, and the governor of Babylon took Nineveh and destroyed it, Sardanapalus perishing in the flames.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Σαρδώ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Σαρδών</foreign>; later <foreign lang="greek">Σαρδανία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Σαρδηνία</foreign>). Sardinia, a large island in the Mediterranean, is in the shape of a parallelogram, upwards of 140 miles in length from north to south, with an average breadth of 60. It was regarded by the ancients as the largest of the Mediterranean islands, and this opinion, though usually considered an error, is now found to be correct; since it appears by actual measurement that Sardinia is a little larger than Sicily. Sardinia lies in almost a central position between Spain, Gaul, Italy, and Africa. A chain of mountains runs along the whole of the eastern side of the island from north to south, occupying about one third of its surface. These mountains were called by the ancients Insani Montes, a name which they probably derived from their wild and savage appearance, and from their being the haunt of numerous robbers. Sardinia was very fertile, but was not extensively cultivated, in consequence of the uncivilized character of its inhabitants. Still the plains in the western and southern parts of the island produced a great quantity of corn, of which much was exported to Rome every year. Among the products of the island one of the most celebrated was the <title>Sardonica herba</title>, a poisonous plant, which was said to produce fatal convulsions in the person who ate of it. These convulsions agitated and distorted the mouth so that the person appeared to laugh, though in excruciating pain; hence the wellknown <title>risus Sardonicus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαρδώνιος γέλως</foreign>, see Suidas, s. h. v.). Sardinia contained a large quantity of the precious metals, especially silver, the mines of which were worked in antiquity to a great extent. There were likewise numerous mineral <figure id="fig.01411">
<head orig="Valley of the Hermus with Acropolis of Sardis.">Valley of the Hermus with Acropolis of Sardis.</head>
</figure> <cb /> springs; and large quantities of salt were manufactured on the western and southern coasts. The Greeks called the island <ref type="cross" target="crossichnusa">Ichnūsa</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰχνοῦσα</foreign>), from its shape, which suggested a footprint, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sandaliōtis</hi> as resembling a sandal (Pausan. x. 17, 2; Sil. Ital. xii. 358; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 85" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iii. 85</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The population of Sardinia was of a very mixed kind. To what race the original inhabitants belonged we are not informed; but it appears that Phoenicians, Tyrrhenians, and Carthaginians settled in the island at different periods. The Greeks are also said to have planted colonies in the island, but this account is very suspicious. Sardinia was known to the Greeks as early as B.C. 500, since we find that Histiaeus of Miletus promised Darius that he would render the island of Sardo tributary to his power. It was conquered by the Carthaginians at an early period, and continued in their possession until the end of the First Punic War. Shortly after this event the Romans availed themselves of the dangerous war which the Carthaginians were carrying on against their mercenaries in Africa to take possession of Sardinia, B.C. 238. It was now formed into a Roman province under the government of a praetor; but a large portion of it was only nominally subject to the Romans; and it was not till after many years and numerous revolts that the inhabitants submitted to the Roman dominion. Sardinia continued to belong to the Roman Empire till the fifth century, when it was taken possession of by the Vandals.

One of the most ancient and famous cities of Asia Minor, and the capital of the great Lydian monarchy, stood on the southern edge of the rich valley of the Hermus, at the northern foot of Mount Tmolus, on the little river Pactolus, 30 stadia (three geographical miles) south of the junction of that river with the Hermus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 101" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 101</bibl>). On a lofty precipitous rock, forming an outpost of the range of Tmolus, was the almost impregnable citadel, which some suppose to be the Hydé of Homer, who, though he never mentions the Lydians or Sardis by name, speaks of Mount Tmolus and the Lake of Gyges ( <bibl n="Hom.

<pb n="1412" /><cb /> The erection of this citadel was ascribed to Meles, an ancient king of Lydia. It was surrounded by a triple wall, and contained the palace and treasury of the Lydian kings. At the downfall of the Lydian Empire, it resisted all the attacks of Cyrus, and was only taken by surprise. The story is told by Herodotus, who relates other legends of the fortress. The rest of the city, which stood in the plain on both sides of the Pactolus, was very slightly built, and was repeatedly burned down, first by <figure id="fig.01412">

The people from whom the name of Sarmatia was derived inhabited only a small portion of the country.

<head orig="Satĭra">Satira</head>

 <p> (earlier form <seg lang="la">satura</seg>, from <hi rend="italic">satur</hi>). A name which the Romans applied to a species of literature which they believed peculiarly their own (<cit><quote lang="la">Graecis intacti carminis,</quote> <bibl n="Hor. S. 1. 10. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>S.</title>i. 10. 66</bibl></cit>; <cit><quote lang="la">satura quidem tota nostra est,</quote> <bibl n="Quint.  10. 1. 93" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. 1. 93</bibl></cit>). The names of all other kinds of poetry indicate their Greek origin. It is probable that <seg lang="la">satura</seg> originally expressed the idea of fulness, abundance, which by special application was extended to mean variety, miscellany, promiscuity, without order. This secondary meaning occurs occasionally in all periods of the literature in the phrase <seg lang="la">per saturam</seg> or <title>in saturam: Sei quid in saturam feretur </title> (<title>Lex Repetund.</title> 72, <title>C. I. L.</title> i. p. 62); <seg lang="la">per saturam aedilem factum</seg> ( <bibl n="Lucil.  1" default="NO" valid="yes">Lucil.1</bibl><bibl n="Lucil.  18" default="NO" valid="yes">Lucil., 18</bibl>M); <seg lang="la">non secundum edicti perpetui ordinationem, sed passim et quasi per saturam collectum, et utile cum inutilibus mixtum</seg> (Justin. Praef. Dig. p. xv.). The term <seg lang="la">satura</seg> was applied to a statute with separate provisions, a bill with “riders” ( <bibl n="Fest.  314" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest.314</bibl>M; Gloss. Philox. ); to a kind of poetry treating of various subjects (Paulus, <title>Excerpt.</title> 315 M); to an intermingling of prose and verse ( <bibl n="Quint.  10. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. 1</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  95" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 95</bibl>); to a mixture of dried grapes, pearled barley and nuts, sprinkled with a preparation of wine (<seg lang="la">mulsum</seg>); to a kind of sausage (Varro <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Diom. p. 486 K); and to a dish of various kinds of fruit offered to Ceres (Acro, on <bibl n="Hor. S. 1.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>S.</title>1.1</bibl>). It is also mentioned by the grammarians as coming from <seg lang="la">satyri</seg> ( <bibl n="Diom.  485" default="NO">Diom.485</bibl>K). The idea of medley pervades the entire use of the word in the literature, and fittingly describes one of the chief characteristics of the satura in the various stages of development. 
<pb n="1414" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Keller and others ignore this, and meet with many difficulties in attempting to connect the dramatic satura with <foreign lang="greek">σάτυροι</foreign>, satyrs, and the literary satura with <foreign lang="greek">σάτυροι</foreign>, the works of a certain Timon of Phlius. Mommsen and Ribbeck would derive <seg lang="la">satura</seg> from <hi rend="italic">satur</hi>, but explain the latter as coming from <foreign lang="greek">σάτυροι</foreign> in a very roundabout way.</p>
 <p>According to Livy 's condensed and somewhat confused account of the old dramatic satura (vii. 2), it would seem that the Romans were indebted to Etruria for certain of its elements. At the celebration of the harvest-home and other rural festivals, the light-hearted, merry people of Latium had long been accustomed to the jovial banter of the Fescennine verses, an entertainment consisting of dialogues of coarse jokes and personal abuse in metrical form, perhaps enlivened by the exhilarating tones of the pipe, or by the beating of time with the feet. In B.C. 364 the magistrates invited a band of Etrurian actors to Rome in the hope of staying the ravages of a terrible pestilence. These actors danced a sort of pantomime to the accompaniment of regularly composed music, and so pleased the people with their performance that the Roman youths—the same ones, no doubt, whose quick wit and dramatic power had made them the leaders in the merriment of their native entertainments—began to imitate the Etruscan actors and to combine the elements of the musical pantomime with the metrical dialogues of the Fescennine raillery, to which they applied the name <seg lang="la">satura</seg>, “medley,” from its composite nature. (Cf. Ital. <hi rend="italic">farsa</hi>, Fr. <hi rend="italic">farce</hi>, Arabic <title>Quassîde</title> as applied to poetry, and Juvenal's term <seg lang="la">farrago</seg> for his Satires.) As the <seg lang="la">satura</seg> developed under the control of the Roman youths and the acting became more and more an art, it finally passed into the hands of professional actors, and the young Romans contented themselves with the less exacting performances of afterplays (<seg lang="la">exodia</seg>), to which the Atellanae also were reduced after the introduction of the regular drama. Livy 's account covers a wide sweep in the development of the native drama.</p>
 <p>If, as Mommsen and Wilamowitz (<title>Hermes</title>, ix. 331) maintain, the <title>fabula Atellana</title>, with its stock characters and rudimentary plot, developed in Latium long before the introduction of the regular drama under Greek influence, then the old dramatic satura was the intermediate step in the growth of the native Italian drama. As the <title>Versus Fescennini</title> were superseded by the satura as a dramatic entertainment, but lived on in the scurrilous verses of the marriage celebration and triumphal songs; so the satura, supplanted by the <title>fabula Atellana</title> and the regular drama, passed into that branch of poetry known as the literary satire.</p>
 <p>Not a few recent scholars have questioned the very existence of an early dramatic satura, and, with Leo and Hendrickson, have regarded it a mere fiction of Livy in his attempt to construct for Roman literature what he learned from Aristotle ( <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>4</bibl>-5) to have existed in Greece. Leo attempts to prove it a fictitious parallel to the Greek satyr-drama, and Hendrickson to the old Attic comedy. To agree with them, one must believe that the Roman genius was unequal to the task of perfecting the native drama beyond the stage of the rude Fescennine verses, though we know that it sprang up and thrived independently in various parts of Greece and under various conditions. The chief reason for questioning the account <cb /> of Livy —repeated with slight additions by Valerius Maximus (xi. 4, 4)—is the resemblance to Aristotle's description of the origin of comedy. The obscure reference in Euanthius, <title>De Com.</title> (ante med.) to satire as <seg lang="la">aliud genus fabulae</seg> and <seg lang="la">quod genus comoediae</seg> shows that the dramatic satura was in his time a mere name, and its place in the growth of literature forgotten.</p>
 <p>It is a fair inference from Livy (vii. 2<bibl n="Liv.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 8</bibl>), that Andronicus, <seg lang="la">qui ab saturis ausus est primus argumento fabulum serere</seg>, had been in the habit of writing saturae before he turned to the regular drama; and in all probability the satura of Naevius, mentioned by Festus, 257 (M), is one of the last examples of the old dramatic satura rather than the beginning of the new literary satire. The conservative spirit of Naevius, his plebeian sympathies, and his adherence to the old Saturnian verse, in which the early saturae were probably written (the verse from Naevius's satura is apparently Saturnian), render this all the more probable.</p>
 <p>With Ennius, an originator in so many lines, satura took on a new form. The success of the new drama with regular plot killed the demand for the old dramatic medley. The new plays, however, were moulded on the type of the New Attic Comedy, the comedy of manners, and gave little opportunity for the display of satire and ridicule which were so characteristic a part of the Roman genius, and which formerly found free play in the old-time burlesques. Ennius, therefore, remodelled the old satura, retaining the name, the spirit, and the essential features. The whole body of literary satire exhibits in varying degrees certain definite characteristics. The language does not rise to the height of the other styles of poetry; Horace speaks of his Satires as <seg lang="la">sermones</seg>, “conversations,” and his muse as <hi rend="italic">pedestris.</hi> It exhibits everywhere the peculiarities of the <seg lang="la">sermo familiaris.</seg> There is a strong tendency to dramatic form. Dialogue is an important feature in all satura down to Juvenal, and traces occur even in his bold declamatory style. Unusual laxity in structural arrangement, easy change of topic, and variety of metres are noticeable in the early writers. In some authors—e. g. Varro, Petronius, and Seneca— a mixture of prose and verse appears; and in all there is a great deal of obscenity, characteristic of its peculiar origin. The satirical spirit, in the modern sense of the word, varies in different authors according to their natural disposition, and to their political, social, and moral environment. The Romans recognized two kinds of satire: <title>Satira dicitur carmen apud Romanos nunc quidem maledictum et ad carpenda hominum vitia archeae comoediae charactere compositum, quale scripserunt Lucilius et Horatius et Persius, et olim carmen quod ex variis poematibus constabat satira vocabatur, quale scripserunt Pacuvius et Ennius</title>, Diom. (Suet. )<bibl n="Suet.  1. 485" default="NO">Suet., i. 485</bibl>(K). This classification has been accepted too literally by modern scholars. Ennius was preëminently an epic poet, tragedian, and scholar, but the subjects of some of his saturae, the Greek writers who influenced him (the Sillographi, etc.), and his own known rationalistic tendencies, assure us that there was at least subtle satire lurking in many of his poems, if there were not also open ridicule. He was more influential perhaps than any other writer in moulding Roman thought on Greek lines, in introducing Greek culture, in awakening scepticism in religion, and in dispelling superstition. It 
<pb n="1415" /><cb /> is more than probable that this was accomplished somewhat by the spirit of satire and ridicule in his poem <title>Epicharmus</title>, which apparently reduced the gods of mythology to the elements of nature, and in the rationalistic poem, <title>Euhemerus</title>, or <title>Sacra Historia.</title> The indecencies of Sotades were, no doubt, ridiculed in the <title>Sota;</title> and the only reason for supposing that the <title>Heduphagetica</title> was not a parody of epic grandeur on the subject of high living was that Ennius is said to have died of the gout. The <title>Scipio</title> can be shown to be a part of his saturae, and it is probable that the <title>Ambracia</title> celebrated the deeds of his patron Fulvius Nobilior in the east, as the Scipio did those of Africanus in Africa. All the minor poems were perhaps collected under the title <title>Saturae</title>, and formed four and perhaps six or more books. See <ref type="cross" target="crossennius">Ennius</ref>.</p>
 <p>Lucilius, a Roman knight of influence, living at a time of great social and political unrest, that of the Gracchi, narrowed the scope of satire and stamped it so deeply with the spirit of invective that he was sometimes spoken of as its very founder (<bibl n="Hor. S. 1. 10.48" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>S.</title>i. 10. 40</bibl>). His criticism of men and affairs, instead of being vindictive and personal, like the lampoons of the Greek iambic writers, was ethical and partisan in tone, and animated by the spirit of the Old Attic Comedy ( <bibl n="Hor. S. 1. 4.6" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>S.</title>i. 4. 6</bibl>), or of the editorial page of the modern newspaper. His “Miscellanies” included the greatest variety of subjects: avarice, gluttony, literature, grammar, friendship, philosophy, religion, superstition, public men, a journey to Sicily, a country dinner, his mistress, contentment with his own lot, his fame, etc., and gave, no doubt, a faithful picture of his times. He employed fables, tales, and dialogue, as did Ennius before him, and spoke either in his own person or in the words of another, as best suited his purpose. We have but fragments of his thirty books, some 1100 in number, too brief to discover the “keen wit and great versatility,” the “wonderful learning and freedom” attributed to him by ancient critics. He began writing in trochaic septenarii, essayed other metres, and finally decided upon hexameters, which comprised twenty-one out of the thirty books, and became the usual form for later satire. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslucilius">Lucilius</ref>.</p>
 <p>The next important writer of saturae was Marcus Terentius Varro, a man of good social standing, prominent in affairs of state, a prolific writer, and the greatest of Roman scholars (Quintil. x. 1, 95). He wrote 150 books of satire like those of Ennius in form, except that prose was intermingled with a great variety of metres—more than twenty different kinds of verse occur in the 591 fragments. He was an old-fashioned man, with a strong sense of humour and real poetic genius. Thoroughly familiar with the spirit of the good old times and conscious of the rapid degeneration about him, he attempted to attract and instruct the young and unlearned with his mass of wise and good-humoured sketches, which treat of almost every conceivable subject, from philosophy down to the common-places of daily life ( <title>Acad.</title> i. 2, 8). He imitated Menippus, the Cynic philosopher and satirist, whose style and manner may be seen in the works of Lucian; and no doubt the same gentle irony and mild satire pervaded the <title>Saturae Menippeae.</title> See <ref type="cross" target="crossvarro">Varro</ref>.</p>
 <p>Horace admired the rough vigour and caustic wit of Lucilius's satires, and made them the models of his own; but his humble social position and <cb /> his former republican alliance prevented him from attacking, in a direct personal way, the evils of society and the State. The less personal subjects of Lucilius's verse—avarice, luxury, philosophy, superstition, the follies of men, etc.—he reviewed in a spirit of gentle irony or mild satire. It would appear from some of his satires—so close is the resemblance, even in details—that the only merit he claimed in his earlier poems was to reproduce his master's thoughts in a more polished and refined style. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshoratius">Horatius</ref>.</p>
 <p>Persius, a young Stoic of noble birth and high ideals, wrote six satires in strained and obscure language. On every page there are reminiscences of Horace, though there was little in common between the circumspect man of society and the callow, unsophisticated philosopher. In form and spirit his satires conform to the standard type. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspersius-flaccus">Persius</ref>.</p>
 <p>The <title>Satira</title> of Petronius resembles Varro's in the medley of prose and various kinds of verse, but it is in reality a sort of satirical romance written in a masterly manner. Only about 100 pages from the fifteenth and sixteenth books remain, full of realistic pictures of society, literary criticism, ghost stories, anecdotes, adventures, all rich in wit and humour, but exceedingly obscene. The fine biographical details are, of course, all fiction. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspetronius">Petronius</ref>.</p>
 <p>Juvenal is the last of the well-known satirists whose works are extant, and his writings exhibit in a more limited degree than any others the characteristic features of the literary satire. Dialogue has almost vanished; the dramatic element is nearly supplanted by the rhetorical; fables, tales, and anecdotes are lacking; the personal, autobiographical feature is not to be found; the peculiarities of the <seg lang="la">sermo familiaris</seg> are chiefly limited to the choice of words; the thought often rises to the heights of true poetry; the structure of the individual satires shows an advance in the more artistic relation of unity and variety; hexameter is the only metre. On the other hand, the remaining characteristics are unusually intensified. The spirit of raillery and mild satire of the preceding poets has become bitter invective. The inordinate amount of obscenity is somewhat mitigated in effect by the tone of denunciation, but he so parades this in some satires that we question whether he was not really infatuated by it. His pictures of later Rome are drawn in the terribly realistic manner of Hogarth. See <ref type="cross" target="crossiuvenalis">Iuvenalis</ref>.</p>
 <p>The history of satire presents a regular and organic structural development, while the spirit varies with the character of the author and his environment. Its scope is narrowed in its descent from writer to writer, but broadened when its growth is considered by periods. At all times it was one of the most effective instruments of reform; and our knowledge of Roman civilization would be vastly enriched if we had the works of all the twenty-eight or thirty writers who we know cultivated this branch of literature.</p>

<head orig="Saturnalia">Saturnalia</head>

 <p> A Roman festival in honour of <ref type="cross" target="crosssaturnus">Saturnus</ref> (q.v.). It was held late in December at the end of the vintage and harvesting, and was in early times the prototype of the English Harvest Home and the American Thanksgiving Day. At all periods it was a season of absolute relaxation, of merriment, and even license. While it continued, no business could be transacted, the law courts were closed, the schools kept holiday, to commence a war was impious, and even to punish a malefactor involved pollution (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 10" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 10</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 16" default="NO"> Sat., 16</bibl>; Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> viii. 7). Special indulgences were granted to the slaves of each domestic establishment; they were relieved from all ordinary toils, were permitted to wear the <seg lang="la">pilleus</seg>, the badge of freedom, received full license of speech, and partook of a banquet attired in the clothes of their masters, and were waited upon by them at table (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 7" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 7</bibl>; Dio Cass. lx. 19; Athen. xiv. 44). All classes devoted themselves to feasting and mirth, presents were interchanged among friends, wax tapers (<seg lang="la">cerei</seg>) being the common offering of the more humble to their superiors, and crowds thronged the streets, shouting <title>Io Saturnalia!</title> (hence <title>clamare Saturnalia</title>), while sacrifices were offered with uncovered head, from a conviction that no ill-omened sight should interrupt the rites of such a happy day. Many of the peculiar customs of this festival exhibit a remarkable resemblance to the sports of our own Christmas and of the Italian Carnival. Thus on the Saturnalia public gambling was allowed by the aediles, just as in the days of our ancestors the most rigid were wont to countenance card-playing on Christmaseve; the whole population threw off the toga, wore a loose gown, called <seg lang="la">synthesis</seg> (q. v.), and walked about with the <seg lang="la">pilleus</seg> on their heads, which reminds us of the dominos, the peaked caps, and other disguises worn by masques and mummers; the <seg lang="la">cerei</seg> were probably employed as the <hi rend="italic">moccoli</hi> now are on the last night of the Carnival; and lastly, one of the amusements in private society was the election of a mock king ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiii. 15</bibl>; Lucian, <title>Saturn.</title> 4), which at once calls to recollection the characteristic ceremony of Twelfth Night.</p>
 <p>During the Republic, although the whole month of December was considered as dedicated to Saturn, <cb /> only one day, the XIV. Kal. Ian., was set apart for the sacred rites of the divinity. When the month was lengthened by the addition of two days upon the adoption of the Julian Calendar, the Saturnalia fell on the XVI. Kal. Ian., which gave rise to confusion and mistakes among the more ignorant portion of the people. To obviate this inconvenience, and allay all religious scruples, Augustus enacted that three whole days, the 17th, 18th, and 19th of December, should in all time coming be hallowed, thus embracing both the old and new style (Macrob. i. 10). Under the Empire the merry-making lasted for seven days, and three different festivals were celebrated during this period. First came the Saturnalia proper, commencing on XVI. Kal. Dec., followed by the Opalia (from Ops, the wife of Saturnus), anciently coincident with the Saturnalia, on XIV. Kal. Ian.; these two together lasted for five days, and the sixth and seventh were occupied with the Sigillaria ( <title>Epist.</title> xii. 3), so called from the little earthenware figures (<seg lang="la">sigilla, oscilla</seg>) exposed for sale at this season, and given as toys to children.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Apulēius</hi>, a Roman who was quaestor in B.C. 104 and tribune of the people in B.C. 102. He was closely allied with Marius and his party, and was very popular with the commons. He became a candidate for the tribuneship for the second time in B.C. 100. At the same time Glaucia, who next to Saturninus was the greatest demagogue of the day, offered himself as a candidate for the praetorship, and Marius for the consulship. Marius and Glaucia carried their elections; but A. Nonius, a partisan of the aristocracy, was chosen tribune instead of Saturninus. Nonius, however, was murdered on the same evening by the emissaries of Glaucia and Saturninus; and early the following morning Saturninus was chosen to fill the vacancy. As soon as he had entered upon his tribunate, he brought forward an agrarian law, which led to the banishment of Metellus Numidicus, as is related elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmetellus">Metellus</ref>, 10.) Saturninus proposed other popular measures, such as a <seg lang="la">lex frumentaria</seg>, and a law for founding new colonies in Sicily, Achaia, and Macedonia. In the Comitia for the election of the magistrates for the following year, Saturninus obtained the tribunate for the third time, and along with him there was chosen a certain Equitius, a runaway slave, 
<pb n="1417" /><cb /> who pretended to be a son of Tiberius Gracchus. Glaucia was at the same time a candidate for the consulship; the two other candidates were M. Antonius and C. Memmius. The election of M. Antonius was certain, and the struggle lay between Glancia and Memmius. As the latter seemed likely to carry his election, Saturninus and Glancia hired some ruffians who murdered him openly in the comitia. This last act produced a complete reaction against Saturninus and his associates. The Senate declared them public enemies, and ordered the consuls to put them down by force. Marius was unwilling to act against his friends, but he had no alternative, and his backwardness was compensated by the zeal of others. Driven out of the Forum, Saturninus, Glaucia, and the quaestor Saufeius took refuge in the Capitol, but the partisans of the Senate cut off the pipes which supplied the Capitol with water. Unable to hold out any longer, they surrendered to Marius. The latter did all he could to save their lives: as soon as they descended from the Capitol, he placed them for security in the Curia Hostilia, but the mob pulled off the tiles of the Senate-House, and pelted them with the tiles till they died. The Senate gave their sanction to these proceedings by rewarding with the citizenship a slave of the name of Scaeva, who claimed the honour of having killed Saturninus. Nearly forty years after these events, the tribune T. Labienus accused an aged senator, Rabirius, of having been the murderer of Saturninus.

<head orig="Saturnius Versus">Saturnius Versus</head>

 <p> “Saturnian verse.” The earliest (native) verse of the ancient Italians, of which at the present time only fragments exist in the shape of religious songs and ritualistic formulas, is accentual rather than quantitative in its metrical character, and is hardly to be reduced to a definite system. The verse, however, in general (<title>numerus Italicus</title>) seems to be based upon a series of four <seg lang="la">theses</seg>, sometimes separate but usually combined in twos and threes. The following prayer to Mars (Cato , <title>R. R.</title> 141) is an example: <lb />Márs páter té précor | quáesóque úti síes | vólens própítiús.</p>
 <p>Of these early rhythms, the so-called “Saturnian verse” is the most regular, as it is the one of which we have the greatest number of existing examples. It consists of two parts, each containing three <cb /> <seg lang="la">theses.</seg> As to its exact character there are three theories: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the Accentual Theory; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the Quantitative Theory; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the Modified Accentual Theory.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Accentual Theory</hi>.—This regards the Saturnian line as divided into two halves, the first having three <seg lang="la">theses</seg> and the second either three or two. If only two, the second half of the line usually has an introductory unaccented syllable (Anacrusis). The quantity of the syllables plays no part in the scansion of the verse. Examples are the following: <lb />Quóius fórma virtútei || parísuma fúit</p>
 <p>and <lb />Dábunt málum Metélli || Naévió poétae.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Quantitative Theory</hi>.—This regards the Saturnian as a trochaic senarius with Anacrusis and a caesura after the third <seg lang="la">arsis</seg> or (rarely) after the third <seg lang="la">thesis.</seg> Short syllables may be lengthened by the <seg lang="la">ictus</seg> or metrical accent, and hiatus is allowed everywhere, being most common in the caesura. Examples are the following: <lb />Eorúm sectám sequóntur || múlti mórtáles</p>
 <p>and <lb />Cornéliús Lucíus || Scípió Barbátus</p>
 <p>and <lb />Quoius fórma vírtutei || parísumá fúit.</p>
 <p>Scholars differ greatly in their explanation of the verse in applying the quantitative theory, some using protraction freely, others rejecting the <hi rend="italic">diastolé</hi> or lengthening of short vowels. The former regard the normal number of feet in each hemistich as four, e. g. <lb />Dabúnt malúm Metéllí || Naévió poétae—</p>
 <p>thus assimilating this scheme to that of the <title>numerus Italicus</title> in general as described above.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Modified Accentual Theory</hi>.—This regards the number of <seg lang="la">theses</seg> in the first hemistich as three, and that in the second hemistich as two, with the accent falling at the beginning of each line. The number of syllables in the first hemistich is normally seven, in the second six, admitting, however, an extra short syllable where the ordinary pronunciation would suppress or slur it. A final short vowel is elided; otherwise partial (semi-) hiatus is allowed, and at the caesura a full hiatus. After the first two feet there is an alternation between words accented on the first and those accented on the second syllable. Examples are: <lb />Dábunt málum Metélli | Naévio poétae</p>
 <p>and <lb />Prima incédit Céreris | Prosérpina púer.</p>
 <p>The name “Saturnian” is applied to the verse either because much used in the early harvest songs in honour of Saturn or from the general meaning of “ancient” attached to the adjective <title>Saturnius.</title> (Cf. Verg. <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 4. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>iv. 6</bibl>; and Nettleship, <title>Lectures and Essays</title>, i. pp. 55-57). Bentley regarded the verse as Greek in its origin, but the general opinion now held makes it indigenous to Italy; Hermann viewing it as Etruscan rather than Italian, but with no good reason. It is, in fact, a measure that finds its counterpart in the early literature of other Indo-European peoples, in the Spanish epic of the <title>Cid</title>, and in the <title>Nibelungenlied;</title> while every one is familiar with Macaulay's identification of it with the nursery line— <lb />The queen was in her parlour || eating bread and honey.

<head orig="Bust of Saturnus. (Vatican.)">Bust of Saturnus. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> Romans invariably identified Saturnus with the Greek Cronos, and hence made the former the father of Iupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Iuno, etc. (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscronus">Cronus</ref>); but there is, in reality, no resemblance between the attributes of the two deities, except that both were regarded as the most ancient divinities in their respective countries. The resemblance is much stronger between Demeter and Saturn, for all that the Greeks ascribe to their Demeter is ascribed by the Italians to Saturn. Saturnus, then, deriving his name from sowing, is called the introducer of civilization and social order, both of which are inseparably connected with agriculture. His reign is conceived for the same reason to have been the Golden Age of Italy, and more especially of the Aborigines, his subjects <cb /> (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> iii. 1, 5). As agricultural industry is the source of wealth and plenty, his wife was Ops, the representative of plenty (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 57). By a confusion of Saturn with Cronos and this with the word <foreign lang="greek">Χρόνος</foreign>, he is also spoken of as the god of time ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>ii. 25</bibl><bibl n="Cic. N.D. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. N. D., 64</bibl>); and Curtius identifies him with the Sun god of the Phoenicians, i. e. Baal (iv. 3, 15).</p>
 <p>The legend ran that the god came to Italy in the reign of Ianus, by whom he was hospitably received, and that he formed a settlement on the Capitoline Hill, which was hence called the Saturnian Hill. At the foot of that hill, on the road leading up to the Capitol, there stood in aftertimes the temple of Saturn. Saturn then taught the people agriculture, suppressed their savage mode of life, and introduced among them civilization and morality. The result was that the whole country was called Saturnia, or the land of plenty. Saturn was suddenly removed from earth to the abodes of the gods, whereupon Ianus erected an altar to him in the Forum. It is further related that Latium received its name (from <seg lang="la">lateo</seg>) from this disappearance of Saturn, who for the same reason was regarded by some as a divinity of the nether world. The statue of Saturnus was hollow and filled with oil, probably to denote the fertility of Latium in olives; in his hand he held a crooked pruning-knife, and his feet were surrounded with a woollen ribbon. In the pediment of the temple of Saturn were seen two figures resembling Tritons with horns, and whose lower extremities grew out of the ground; the temple itself was used as the treasury of the State, and many records also were deposited in it.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σάτυροι</foreign>) and Doric <hi rend="bold"> Tityri</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Τίτυροι</foreign>). The name of a class of beings in Greek mythology, who are inseparably connected with the worship of Dionysus, and represent the luxuriant vital powers of Nature.

The Satyrs are represented with bristly hair, the nose blunt and somewhat turned upward, the ears pointed at the top, like those of animals, with two small horns growing out of the top of the forehead, with a tail like that of a horse or goat, and with teat-like protuberances (<foreign lang="greek">φήρεα</foreign>) on the neck. In works of art they are represented at different stages of life; the older ones were commonly called <figure id="fig.01418.2">

<pb n="1419" /><cb /> Sileni, and the younger ones are termed Satyrisci. The Satyrs are always described as fond of wine (whence they often appear either with a cup or a <seg lang="la">thyrsus</seg> in their hand), and of every kind of sensual pleasure, whence they are seen sleeping, playing musical instruments, or engaged in voluptuous dances with nymphs. Vase-painters represent them as resembling also the Bacchantes and (rarely) Iris. They are dressed with the skins of animals, and wear wreaths of vine, ivy, or fir. Like all the gods dwelling in forests and fields, they were greatly dreaded by mortals. Later writers, especially the Roman poets, confound the Satyrs with the Italian Fauni, and accordingly represent them with larger horns and goats' feet, although originally they were quite distinct kinds of beings. They are also incorrectly identified with the Panes.

<div2 id="crosssatyric-drama" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Satyric Drama">Satyric Drama</head>

 <p> One of the three varieties of the Attic drama. Its origin may be traced back to Pratinas of Phlius (about B.C. 500). It is probable that, after settling in Athens, he adapted the old dithyramb with its chorus of Satyrs, which was customary in his native place, to the form of tragedy which had been recently invented in Athens. This new kind of drama met with so much approval and was so much developed by Pratinas himself as well as by his son Aristeas, by Choerilus, by Aeschylus, and the dramatists who succeeded him, that it became the custom to act a satyric drama after a set of three tragedies. The intensity of the preceding plays was thus relieved, while the chorus of Satyrs and Sileni, the companions of Dionysus, served to indicate the original connection between that divinity and the drama. The material for a satyric drama, like that for a tragedy, was taken from an epic or legendary story, and the action, which took place under an open sky, in a lonely wood, the haunt of the Satyrs, had generally an element of tragedy; but the characteristic solemnity and stateliness of tragedies was somewhat diminished, without in any way impairing the splendour of the tragic costume and the dignity of the heroes introduced. The amusing effect of the play did not depend so much on the action itself, as was the case in comedy, but rather on the relation of the chorus to that action. That relation was in keeping with the wanton, saucy, and insolent, and at the same time cowardly, nature of the Satyrs. The number of persons in the chorus is not known; probably there were either twelve or fifteen, as in tragedy. In accordance with the popular notions about the Satyrs, their costume consisted of the skin of a goat, deer, or panther, thrown over the naked body, and besides this a hideous mask and bristling hair. The dance of the chorus in the satyric drama was called <foreign lang="greek">σίκιννις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σίκιννον</foreign>, and consisted of a fantastic kind of skipping and jumping. The only satyric play now extant is the <title>Cyclops</title> of Euripides (translated into English by Shelley), though the <title>Alcestis</title> of the same poet has some satyric features. The Romans did not imitate this kind of drama in their literature (Marius Victor, in <title>Gram. Lat.</title> vi. 82), although, like the Greeks, they composed amusing afterpieces following their serious plays. See Welcker, <title>Griech. Tragödie</title>, 1361; and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Exodium</hi>.

<head orig="Scaevŏla">Scaevola</head>

 <p> The name of a distinguished family of the Mucian gens. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Mucius Scaevŏla</hi>. When King Porsena was besieging Rome, G. Mucius went out of the city with the intention of killing him, but by mistake stabbed the king's secretary instead of Porsena himself. The king in his passion and alarm ordered him to be burned alive, upon which Mucius thrust his right hand into a fire which was already lighted for a sacrifice, and held it there without flinching. The king, amazed at his firmness, ordered him to be removed from the altar, and bade him go away free and uninjured. To make some return for his generous behaviour, Mucius told him that there were three hundred of the first youths of Rome who had agreed with one another to kill the king; that the lot fell on him to make the first attempt, and that the rest would do the same when their turn came. Porsena being alarmed for his life, which he could not secure against so many desperate men, made proposals of peace to the Romans, and evacuated the territory. Mucius received the name of Scaevola, or “left-handed,” from the loss of his right hand (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 12</bibl> and 13).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Mucius Scaevŏla</hi>, tribune of the plebs in B.C. 141, praetor in 136, and consul in 133, the year in which Tib. Gracchus lost his life. In 131 he succeeded his brother Mucianus as Pontifex Maximus. Scaevola was distinguished for his knowledge of the <seg lang="la">ius pontificium.</seg> His fame as a lawyer is recorded by Cicero in several passages.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Mucius Scaevŏla</hi>, the augur, married the daughter of C. Laelius, the friend of Scipio Africanus the younger. He was tribune of the plebs in B.C. 128, plebeian aedile in 125, and as praetor was governor of the province of Asia in 121, the year in which C. Gracchus lost his life. He was prosecuted after his return from his province for the offence of <seg lang="la">repetundae</seg>, in 120, by T. Albucius, but was acquitted. He was consul in 117. He lived at least to the tribunate of P. Sulpicius Rufus, 88. Cicero, who was born in 106, informs us that after he had put on the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>, his father took him to Scaevola, who was then an <cb /> old man, and that he kept as close to him as he could, in order to profit by his remarks. After his death Cicero became a hearer of Q. Mucius Scaevola, the Pontifex. The augur was distinguished for his knowledge of the law; but none of his writings are recorded. He is one of the speakers in the treatise <title>De Oratore</title>, in the <title>Laelius</title>, and in the <title>De Republica</title> (i. 12).</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Mucius Scaevŏla</hi>, Pontifex Maximus, was tribune of the plebs in B.C. 106, curule aedile in 104, and consul in 95, with Licinius Crassus, the orator, as his colleague. After his consulship Scaevola was proconsul of Asia, in which capacity he gained the esteem of the people under his government. Subsequently he was made Pontifex Maximus. He lost his life in the consulship of C. Marius the younger and Cn. Papirius Carbo (82), having been proscribed by the Marian party. The virtues of Scaevola are recorded by Cicero, who, after the death of the augur, became an attendant (<seg lang="la">auditor</seg>) of the Pontifex. The purity of his moral character, his exalted notions of equity and fair dealing, his abilities as an administrator, an orator, and a jurist, place him among the first of the illustrious men of all ages and countries. He is the first Roman to whom we can attribute a scientific and systematic handling of the <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg>, which he accomplished in a work in eighteen books. He also wrote a book on legal definitions, which is the oldest work quoted in the Digest. <figure id="fig.01420">

<head orig="Scalĭger">Scaliger</head>

 <p> The Latinized form of a family name originally Italian (della Scala) and afterwards French (de l'Escale), made famous as that of two great classical scholars. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iulius Caesar Scalĭger</hi>, born in 1484 and claiming descent from an illustrious family of Verona, but by his enemies said to be the son of a sign-painter. After serving 
<pb n="1421" /><cb /> in the army under the emperor Maximilian, he entered the University of Bologna, where he remained a short time, and then took service in the French armies in Italy, winning the approval of King Francis for gallantry and remarkable feats of strength. He became naturalized as a French subject in 1528, when he settled at Agen and began practice as a physician. He had learned some Greek and prided himself on his Latin style, so that he felt called upon to attack Erasmus with bitter invectives for his satire on the stylists of Italy entitled <title>Ciceronianus</title>, a satire which Scaliger interpreted as an attack on Cicero himself. Scaliger died in 1558. His chief works were a grammar, <title>De Causis Linguae Latinae</title>, in thirteen books and of much value; a commentary on Theophrastus; an edition of Aristotle, <title>De Animalibus</title>, with notes; commentaries on Hippocrates, <title>De Insomniis;</title> and some Latin poems of considerable merit. Scaliger was a man of fine natural gifts but of a coarse and jealous nature, and with an education too unsystematic to enable his powers to appear in their true greatness. See Nisard, <bibl default="NO"><title>Les Gladiateurs de la République des Lettres</title> (Paris, 1860)</bibl>; Bourousse de Laffore, <bibl default="NO"><title>Jules César de l'Escale</title> (Agen, 1860)</bibl>; Magen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa Famille</title> (Agen, 1873)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Joseph Justus Scalĭger</hi>. The tenth child of Julius Caesar Scaliger, born at Agen in 1540. He studied as a boy at the Collège de Guyenne in Bordeaux, and was also trained by his father, who made him copy from eighty to two hundred lines of Latin verse every day, besides writing an original Latin theme. After his father's death, the young man went to Paris, where he studied at the University under Adrian Turnebus, from whom he learned Greek, reading all Homer in twenty-one days and the whole body of Greek poetry in four months. His linguistic studies advanced, until at last he boasted of being able to speak thirteen languages, ancient and modern. After travelling in Italy, England, and even Scotland, he settled at Valence in France <bibl default="NO">(1570)</bibl>, and pursued a course of study under the jurist Cujacius; and from 1572 to 1574 was professor in the academy at Geneva founded by Calvin. About this time he began producing the great works that secured him the primacy among the classical scholars of Europe. Among these productions are to be mentioned his <title>Coniectanea</title> to <bibl default="NO">Varro's <title>Lingua Latina</title> (1565)</bibl>; his <title>Catalecta Vergilii</title>, etc. <bibl default="NO">(1572)</bibl>; his editions of Festus <bibl default="NO">(1575)</bibl>, Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius <bibl default="NO">(1577)</bibl>; Manilius <bibl default="NO">(1579)</bibl>; and especially a remarkable treatise on the Eusebian chronology, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Emendatione Temporum</title> (1583)</bibl>; a <bibl default="NO"><title>Thesaurus Temporum</title> (1606)</bibl>; twenty-four indices to <bibl default="NO">Gruter's <title>Thesaurus Inscriptionum Latinarum</title> (1601)</bibl>; a numismatical treatise, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Re Nummaria</title> (1616)</bibl>; besides <bibl default="NO"><title>Opuscula</title> (1610)</bibl>, and <bibl default="NO"><title>De Arte Critica</title> (1619)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>In 1583 Scaliger was called to Leyden to succeed Justus <ref type="cross" target="crosslipsius">Lipsius</ref> (q.v.), and at this university he spent the rest of his life. To his influence and example Holland owes the long line of illustrious scholars that follow one another so closely in the seventeenth century and whose memory is still cherished. His later years were made unhappy by the numerous controversies in which he became engaged, and whose motives sprang largely from the <seg lang="la">odium theologicum.</seg> An outrageous but immensely able attack made upon him by the Jesuit scholar Gaspar Scioppius is believed to have actually <cb /> hastened Scaliger's death. This attack was contained in a treatise styled <title>Scaliger Hypobolimaeus</title>, and ridiculed Scaliger's pretensions to aristocratic descent, holding him up to the scorn of all Europe as a base-born impostor and an atheist. Scaliger died in 1609. His great learning, keen critical faculty, and rare achievements have led men to regard him as, on the whole, the first scholar of all time. Niebuhr spoke of him as standing “on the summit of real and universal knowledge, as no one after him has done.” Pattison calls his “the most richly stored intellect that ever spent itself in acquiring knowledge.”</p>

 <p>(1) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus"> Marcus,</ref> a Roman who raised his family from obscurity to the highest rank among the Roman nobles. He was born in B.C. 163. His father, notwithstanding his patrician descent, had been obliged, through poverty, to carry on the trade of a coal merchant, and left his son a very slender patrimony. The latter had thought at first of carrying on the trade of a money-lender; but he finally resolved to devote himself to the study of eloquence, with the hope of rising to the honors of the State. He likewise served in the army, where he appears to have gained some distinction. He was curule aedile in 123, and obtained the consulship in 115, when he carried on war with success against several of the Alpine tribes. In 112 he was sent at the head of an embassy to Iugurtha; and in 111 he accompanied the consul, L. Calpurnius Bestia, as one of his legates, in the war against Iugurtha. The Numidian king bestowed large sums of money upon both Bestia and Scaurus, in consequence of which the consul granted the king most favourable terms of peace. This disgraceful transaction excited the greatest indignation at Rome; and C. Mamilius, the tribune of the people (110) brought forward a bill by which an inquiry was to be instituted against all those who had received bribes from Iugurtha. Although Scaurus had been one of the most guilty, such was his influence in the State that he contrived to be appointed one of the three quaesitores who were elected under the bill for the purpose of prosecuting the criminals. But, though he thus secured himself, he was unable to save any of his accomplices. Bestia and many others were condemned. In 109, Scaurus was censor with M. Livius Drusus. In his consulship he restored the Milvian Bridge, and constructed the Aemilian Way, which ran by Pisae and Luna as 
<pb n="1423" /><cb /> far as Dertona. In 107 he was elected consul a second time, in place of L. Cassius Longinus, who had fallen in battle against the Tigurini. In the struggles between the aristocratical and popular parties, Scaurus was always a warm supporter of the former. He was several times accused of different offences, chiefly by his private enemies; but such was his influence in the State, that he was always acquitted. He died about B.C. 89. By his wife Caecilia Scaurus had three children, two sons mentioned below, and a daughter Aemilia, first married to M'. Glabrio, and next to Cn. Pompey, subsequently the triumvir.</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, eldest son of the preceding, and stepson of the dictator Sulla , whom his mother Caecilia married after the death of his father. In the Third Mithridatic War he served under Pompey as quaestor. The latter sent him to Damascus with an army, and from thence he marched into Iudaea, to settle the disputes between the brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. Scaurus was left by Pompey in the command of Syria with two legions. During his government of Syria he made a predatory incursion into Arabia Petraea, but withdrew on the payment of 300 talents by Aretas, the king of the country. He was curule aedile in B.C. 58, when he celebrated the public games with extraordinary splendour. The temporary theatre which he built accommodated 80,000 spectators, and was adorned in the most magnificent manner. Three hundred and sixty pillars decorated the stage, arranged in three stories, of which the lowest was made of white marble, the middle one of glass, and the highest of gilt wood. The combats of wild beasts were equally astonishing. One hundred and fifty panthers were exhibited in the circus, and five crocodiles and a hippopotamus were seen for the first time at Rome. In the year 56 he was praetor, and in the following year governed the province of Sardinia, which he plundered without mercy. On his return to Rome he was accused of the crime of <seg lang="la">repetundae.</seg> He was defended by Cicero, Hortensius, and others, and was acquitted, notwithstanding his guilt. He was accused again in 52, under Pompey's new law against bribery, and was condemned. He married Mucia, who had been previously the wife of Pompey, and by her he had one son.</p>
 <p>(3) Younger son of No. 1, fought under the proconsul, Q. Catulus, against the Cimbri at the Athesis, and having fled from the field, was indignantly commanded by his father not to come into his presence; whereupon the youth put an end to his life.</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, son of No. 2, and Mucia, the former wife of Pompey the triumvir, and consequently the half-brother of Sex. Pompey. He accompanied the latter into Asia, after the defeat of his fleet in Sicily, but betrayed him into the hands of the generals of M. Antonius, in 35. After the battle of Actium, he fell into the power of Octavian, and escaped death, to which he had been sentenced, only through the intercession of his mother, Mucia.</p>
 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossmamercus">Mamercus</ref>, son of No. 5, was a distinguished orator and poet, but of a dissolute character. He was a member of the Senate at the time of the accession of Tiberius, A.D. 14, when he offended that suspicious emperor by some remarks which he made in the Senate. Being accused of <seg lang="la">maiestas</seg> in 34, he put an end to his own life.

 <p>An archaeologist born at Neubuckow, in Germany, January 6th, 1822. He was the son of a Lutheran pastor, who inspired him at an early age with an enthusiastic admiration of the heroes of ancient Greece. His mother died when he was nine years old, and he then lived for two years with his uncle at Kalkhorst. At fourteen he was compelled to enter a grocer's shop as a clerk at Fürstenberg to support himself. He remained in that humble position for over five years, when he obtained a position as clerk to an Amsterdam firm, and in 1846 was sent to St. Petersburg by the firm as their local agent; and a year later established there a business of his own. In the course of a busy life he travelled extensively in Europe and America, and acquired many languages. After he had amassed wealth he commenced his archaeological investigations and excavations in the East. In 1874 he obtained permission from the Greek government to excavate Mycenae, where, in 1877, he made the marvellous discovery of the five royal tombs which local tradition had pointed out to Pausanius as those of Agamemnon and his companions, who had been murdered by Aegisthus. His later excavations are well known.

 <p> <hi rend="SmallCaps">Kaspar (Kaspar Schoppe)</hi>. A classical scholar and famous controversialist, who was born at Neumark, May 27, 1576. He studied at Heidelberg, Altorf, and Ingolstadt, and after visiting Rome in 1598 and being converted to Roman Catholicism, became widely known as the able and unsparing critic of the great Protestant scholars, publishing many pamphlets and controversial tracts. He was a man of great learning and possessed a style of unusual power and precision, and all of these qualities are exhibited in the wellknown diatribe which he launched against Joseph Scaliger and which hastened the death of that great scholar.

 <p> The name of an illustrious patrician family of the Cornelian gens. This name, which signifies a stick or staff, is said to have been given to the founder of the family, because he served as a staff in directing his blind father. This family produced some of the greatest men in Rome, and to them she was more indebted than to any others for the empire of the world. The family tomb of the Scipios was discovered in 1780, on the left of the Appia Via, about four hundred paces within the modern Porta S. Sebastiano. The inscriptions and other curiosities are now deposited in the Museo Pio-Clementino at Rome.</p>

The genealogy of the family can be traced with more certainty from this time.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn. Cornelius Scipio Asĭna</hi>, son of No. 4, was consul 260, in the First Punic War.

</figure> against the Istri, who were subdued by the consuls. He is mentioned again in 211, when he recommended that the Senate should recall all the generals and armies from Italy for the defence of the capital, because Hannibal was marching upon the city.</p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio</hi>, son of No. 6, was consul, with Ti. Sempronius Longus , in 218, the first year of the Second Punic War. He sailed with an army to Gaul, in order to encounter Hannibal before crossing the Alps; but, finding that Hannibal had crossed the Rhône, and had got the start of him by a three days' march, he resolved to sail back to Italy and await Hannibal's arrival in Cisalpine Gaul. But as the Romans had an army of twenty-five thousand men in Cisalpine Gaul, under the command of two praetors, Scipio sent into Spain the army which he had brought with him, under the command of his brother, Cn. Scipio. On his return to Italy, Scipio took the command of the army in Cisalpine Gaul, and hastened to meet Hannibal. An engagement took place between the cavalry and light-armed troops of the two armies. The Romans were defeated; the consul himself received a severe wound, and was only saved from death by the courage of his young son Publius, the future conqueror of Hannibal. Scipio now retreated across the Ticinus, crossed the Po also, first took up his quarters at Placentia, and subsequently withdrew to the hills on the left bank of the Trebia, where he was joined by the other consul, Sempronius Longus. The latter resolved upon a battle, in opposition to the advice of his colleague. The result was the complete defeat of the Roman army, which was obliged to take refuge within the walls of Placentia. In the following year (217), Scipio, whose imperium had been prolonged, crossed over into Spain. He and his brother Gneius continued in Spain until their death in 211, and did the most important service for their country by preventing reinforcements being sent to Hannibal from Spain. In 215 they transferred the war from the Ebro to the Guadalquivir and won two great victories at Illiturgis and Intibilis. They fortified an important harbour at Tarraco and regained Saguntum, and by adroit policy induced Syphax to turn against the Carthaginians in Africa; but in 212, having to confront three armies under Hasdrubal Barca, Hasdrubal Gisgo, and Mago, they enlisted 20,000 Celtiberians and divided their armies. This was a fatal step. The Spaniards were untrustworthy, and the armies of the Scipios were defeated separately and both the brothers were slain by the Carthaginians (Polyb. iii.; <bibl n="Liv.  12." default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xii.</bibl>-xxv.; <cb /> <title>Annib.</title> 5-8; <bibl n="App. Hisp. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hisp.</title>14</bibl>-16).</p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn. Cornelius Scipio Calvus</hi>, son of No. 6, and brother of No. 8, was consul 222, with M. Claudius Marcellus. In conjunction with his colleague he carried on war against the Insubrians. In 218 he carried on war as the legate of his brother Publius for eight years in Spain, as has been related above (Polyb. ii. 34; <title>Marcell.</title> 6, 7).
 </p>
 <p>(10) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Africānus Maior</hi>, son of No. 8, was born in B.C. 237. (According to <bibl n="Liv.  26. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxvi. 18</bibl>, and Val. Max. iii. 7, 1, he was born in 234, but the authority of Polybius should be followed, who says that he was twenty-seven when he went to Spain.) He was unquestionably one of the greatest men of Rome, and he acquired at an early age the confidence and admiration of his countrymen. His enthusiastic mind led him to believe that he was a special favourite of the gods; and he never engaged in any public or private business without first going to the Capitol, where he sat some time alone, enjoying communication with the gods. For all he proposed or executed he alleged the divine approval; and the Roman people gave credit to his assertions and regarded him as a being almost superior to the common race of men (<bibl n="Liv.  26. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxvi. 19</bibl>). There can be no doubt that Scipio himself believed in the divine revelations which he asserted to have been vouchsafed to him; and the extraordinary success which attended all his enterprises must have deepened this belief. He is first mentioned in 218 at the battle of the Ticinus, when he saved the life of his father as has been already related. He fought at Cannae two years afterwards (216), when he was already a tribune of the soldiers, and was one of the few Roman officers who survived that fatal day. He was chosen along with Appius Claudius to command the remains of the army, which had taken refuge at Canusium; and it was owing to his youthful heroism and presence of mind that the Roman nobles, who had thought of leaving Italy in despair, were prevented from carrying their rash project into effect. He had already gained the favour of the people to such an extent that he was elected aedile in 212, although he had not yet reached the legal age. In 210, after the death of his father and uncle in Spain, the Romans resolved to increase their army in that country, and to place it under the command of a proconsul. But when the people assembled to elect a proconsul, none of the generals of experience ventured to sue for so dangerous a command. At length Scipio, who was then barely twenty-four, offered himself as a candidate, and was chosen with enthusiasm to take the command. His success in Spain was striking and rapid. In the first campaign (210) he took the important city of Carthago Nova, and in the course of the next three years he drove the Carthaginians entirely out of Spain, and became master of that country. He returned to Rome in 206, and was elected consul for the following year (205), although he had not yet filled the office of praetor, and was only thirty years of age. He was anxious to cross over at once to Africa, and bring the contest to an end at the gates of Carthage; but the oldest members of the Senate, and among them Q. Fabius Maximus, 
<pb n="1426" /><cb /> opposed his project, partly through timidity and partly through jealousy of the youthful conqueror. All that Scipio could obtain was the province of Sicily, with permission to cross over to Africa; but the Senate refused him an army, thus making the permission of no practical use. But the allies had a truer view of the interests of Italy than the Roman Senate, and from all the towns of Italy volunteers flocked to join the standard of the youthful hero. The Senate could not refuse to allow him to enlist volunteers; and such was the enthusiasm in his favour that he was able to cross over to Sicily with an army and a fleet contrary to the expectations and even the wishes of the Senate. After spending the winter in Sicily, and completing all his preparations for the invasion of Africa, he crossed over to the latter country in the course of the following year. Success again attended his arms. The Carthaginians and their ally Syphax were defeated with great slaughter, and the former were compelled to recall Hannibal from Italy as the only hope of saving their country. The long struggle between the two peoples was at length brought to a close by the battle fought near the city of Zama on the 19th of October, 202, in which Scipio gained a decisive and brilliant victory over Hannibal. Carthage had no alternative but submission, but the final treaty was not concluded till the following year (201). Scipio returned to Italy in 201, and entered Rome in triumph. He was received with universal enthusiasm, and the surname of Africanus was conferred upon him. The people wished to make him consul and dictator for life, and to erect his statue in the Comitia, the Rostra, the Curia, and even in the Capitol, but he prudently declined all these invidious distinctions. As he did not choose to usurp the supreme power, and as he was an object of suspicion and dislike to the majority of the Senate, he took no prominent part in public affairs during the next few years. He was censor in 199 with P. Aelius Paetus, and consul a second time in 194 with Ti. Sempronius Longus. In 193 he was one of the three commissioners who were sent to Africa to mediate between Masinissa and the Carthaginians; and in the same year he was one of the ambassadors sent to Antiochus at Ephesus, at whose court Hannibal was then residing. The tale runs that he had there an interview with the great Carthaginian, who declared him the greatest general that ever lived. The compliment was paid in a manner the most flattering to Scipio. The latter had asked, “Who was the greatest general?” “Alexander the Great,” was Hannibal's reply. “Who was the second?” “Pyrrhus.” “Who the third?” “Myself,” replied the Carthaginian. “What would you have said, then, if you had conquered me?” asked Scipio, in astonishment. “I should then have placed myself before Alexander, before Pyrrhus, and before all other generals.” In 190 Africanus served as legate under his brother Lucius in the war against Antiochus the Great. Shortly after his return, he and his brother Lucius were accused of having received bribes from Antiochus to let the monarch off too leniently, and of having appropriated to their own use part of the money which had been paid by Antiochus to the Roman State. The details of the accusation are related with such discrepancies by the ancient authorities that it is impossible to determine with certainty the true <cb /> history of the affair, or the year in which it occurred. It appears, however, that there were two distinct prosecutions, and the following is perhaps the most probable history of the transaction. In 187, two tribunes of the people of the name of Petillii, instigated by Cato and the other enemies of the Scipios, required L. Scipio to render an account of all the sums of money which he had received from Antiochus. L. Scipio accordingly prepared his accounts, but as he was in the act of delivering them up, the proud conqueror of Hannibal indignantly snatched them out of his hands, and tore them into pieces before the Senate. But this haughty conduct appears to have produced an unfavourable impression, and his brother, when brought to trial in the course of the same year, was declared guilty, and sentenced to pay a heavy fine. The tribune C. Minucius Augurinus ordered him to be dragged to prison and there detained till the money was paid; whereupon Africanus res<figure id="fig.01426">
<head orig="Scipio Africanus Maior. (Capitol.)">Scipio Africanus Maior. (Capitol.)</head>
</figure> cued his brother from the hands of the tribune's officer. The contest would probably have been attended with fatal results had not Tiberius Gracchus, the father of the celebrated tribune, and then tribune himself, had the prudence to release Lucius from the sentence of imprisonment. The successful issue of the prosecution of Lucius emboldened his enemies to bring the great Africanus himself before the people. His accuser was M. Naevius, the tribune of the people, and the accusation was brought in 185. When the trial came on, and Africanus was summoned, he proudly reminded the people that this was the anniversary of the day on which he had defeated Hannibal at Zama, and called upon them to follow him to the Capitol, in order there to return thanks to the immortal gods, and to pray that they would grant the Roman State other citizens like himself. Scipio struck a chord which vibrated in every heart, and he was immediately followed by crowds to the Capitol. Having thus set all the laws at defiance, Scipio immediately quitted Rome, and retired to his country seat at Liternum. The tribunes wished to renew the prosecution, but Gracchus wisely persuaded them to let it drop. Scipio never returned to Rome. He passed his remaining days in the cultivation of his estate at Liternum; and at his death is said to have requested that his body might be buried there, and not in his ungrateful country. The year of his death is equally uncertain; but he probably died in 183. Scipio married Aemilia, the daughter of L. Aemilius Paulus, who fell at the battle of Cannae, and by her he had four children, two sons (Nos. 12, 13), and two daughters, the elder of whom married P. Scipio Nasica Corculum (No. 17), 
<pb n="1427" /><cb /> and the younger Tiberius Gracchus, and thus became the mother of the two celebrated tribunes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscornelia">Cornelia</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(11) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Cornelius Scipio Asiatĭcus</hi>, also called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asiagĕnes</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asiagĕnus</hi>, was the son of No. 8, and the brother of the great Africanus. He served under his brother in Spain; was praetor in B.C. 193, when he obtained the province of Sicily; and consul in 190, with C. Laelius. The Senate had not much confidence in his abilities, and it was only through the offer of his brother Africanus to accompany him as a legate that he obtained the province of Greece and the conduct of the war against Antiochus. He defeated Antiochus at Mount Sipylus, in 190, entered Rome in triumph in the following year, and assumed the surname of Asiaticus. The history of his accusation and condemnation has been already related in the life of his brother. He was a candidate for the censorship in 184, but was defeated by the old enemy of his family, M. Porcius Cato, who deprived Asiaticus of his horse at the review of the <seg lang="la">equites.</seg> It appears, therefore, that even as late as this time an <seg lang="la">eques</seg> did not forfeit his horse by becoming a senator.</p>
 <p>(12) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Africānus</hi>, elder son of the great Africanus, was prevented by his weak health from taking any part in public affairs. Cicero praises his oratiunculae and his Greek history, and remarks that, with the greatness of his father's mind he possessed a larger amount of learning. He had no son of his own, but adopted the son of L. Aemilius Paulus (see below, No. 15).</p>
 <p>(13) L. or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn. Cornelius Scipio Africānus</hi>, younger son of the great Africanus. He accompanied his father into Asia in B.C. 190, and was taken prisoner by Antiochus. This Scipio was a degenerate son of an illustrious father, and only obtained the praetorship, in B.C. 174, through Cicereius, who had been a secretary of his father, giving way to him. In the same year he was expelled from the Senate by the censors.</p>
 <p>(14) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Cornelius Scipio Asiatĭcus</hi>, a descendant of No. 11, belonged to the Marian party, and was consul B.C. 83 with C. Norbanus. In this year Sulla returned to Italy: Scipio was deserted by his troops, and taken prisoner in his camp along with his son Lucius, but was dismissed by Sulla uninjured. He was, however, included in the proscription in the following year (82), whereupon he fled to Massilia, and passed there the remainder of his life. His daughter was married to P. Sestius.</p>
 <p>(15) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Aemiliānus Africānus Minor</hi>, was the younger son of L. Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, and was adopted by P. Scipio (No. 12), the son of the conqueror of Hannibal. He was born about B.C. 185. In his seventeenth year he accompanied his father Paulus to Greece, and fought under him at the battle of Pydna, 168. Scipio devoted himself with ardour to the study of literature, and formed an intimate friendship with Polybius, when the latter came to Rome along with the other Achaean exiles in 167. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspolybius">Polybius</ref>.) At a later period he also cultivated the acquaintance of the philosopher Panaetius, and he likewise admitted the poets Lucilius and Terence to his intimacy, and is said to have assisted the latter in the composition of his comedies. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossterentius-afer">Terentius</ref>.) His friendship with Laelius, whose tastes and pursuits were so congenial to his own, has been immortalized by Cicero's celebrated treatise entitled <title>Laelius sive de Amicitia.</title> Although thus devoted to the study of <cb /> polite literature, Scipio is said to have cultivated the virtues which distinguished the older Romans, and to have made Cato the model of his conduct. If we may believe his panegyrists, he possessed all the simple virtues of an old Roman, mellowed by the refining influences of Greek civilization. Scipio first served in Spain with great distinction as military tribune under the consul L. Lucullus in 151. On the breaking out of the Third Punic War in 149 he accompanied the Roman army to Africa, again with the rank of military tribune. Here he gained still more renown. By his personal bravery and military skill he repaired, to a great extent, the mistakes of the consul Manilius, whose army on one occasion he saved from destruction. He returned to Rome in 148, and had already gained such popularity that when he became a candidate for the aedileship for the following year (147) he was elected consul, although he was only thirty-seven, and had not therefore attained the legal age. The Senate assigned to him Africa as his province, to which he forthwith sailed, accompanicd by his friends Polybius and Laelius. He prosecuted the siege of Carthage with the utmost vigour. The Carthaginians defended themselves with the courage of despair, and the Romans were unable to force their way into the city till the spring of the following year (146). The inhabitants fought from street to street, and from house to house, and the work of destruction and butchery went on for days. The fate of this once magnificent city moved Scipio to tears, and anticipating that a similar catastrophe might one day befall Rome, he repeated the lines of the <title>Iliad</title> (vi. 448), in which Hector bewails the approaching fall of Troy. After reducing Africa to the form of a Roman province, Scipio returned to Rome in the same year, and celebrated a splendid triumph on account of his victory. The surname of Africanus, which he had inherited by adoption from the conqueror of Hannibal, had been now acquired by him by his own exploits. In 142 Scipio was censor, and in the administration of the duties of his office he attempted to repress the growing luxury and immorality of his contemporaries. His efforts, however, were thwarted by his colleague Mummius, who had himself acquired a love for Greek and Asiatic luxuries. In 139 Scipio was accused by Ti. Claudius Asellus of <seg lang="la">maiestas.</seg> Asellus attacked him out of private animosity, because he had been deprived of his horse, and reduced to the condition of an <seg lang="la">aerarius</seg> by Scipio in his censorship. Scipio was acquitted, and the speeches which he delivered on the occasion obtained great celebrity. It appears to have been after this event that Scipio was sent on an embassy to Egypt and Asia to attend to the Roman interests in those countries. The long continuance of the war in Spain again called Scipio to the consulship. He was appointed consul in his absence, and had the province of Spain assigned to him in 134. His operations were attended with success; and in 133 he brought the war to a conclusion by the capture of the city of Numantia after a long siege. He now received the surname of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Numantīnus</hi> in addition to that of Africanus. During his absence in Spain Tiberius Gracchus had been put to death. Scipio was married to Sempronia, the sister of the fallen tribune, but he had no sympathy with his reforms, and no sorrow for his fate. Upon his return to Rome in 132, he did not disguise his sentiments, and when asked 
<pb n="1428" /><cb />
 in the assembly of the tribes by C. Papirius Carbo, the tribune, what he thought of the death of Tiberius Gracchus, he boldly replied that he was justly slain (<seg lang="la">iure caesum</seg>). The people loudly expressed their disapprobation; whereupon Scipio proudly bade them to be silent. He now took the lead in opposing the popular party, and endeavoured to prevent the agrarian law of Tiberius Graechus from being carried into effect. In order to accomplish this object, he proposed in the Senate (129) that all disputes respecting the lands of the allies should be taken out of the hands of the commissioners appointed under the law of Tiberius Gracchus, and should be committed to other persons. This would have been equivalent to an abrogation of the law; and accordingly Fulvius Flaccus, Papirius Carbo, and C. Gracchus, the three commissioners, offered the most vehement opposition to his proposal. In the Forum he was accused by Carbo with the bitterest invectives as the enemy of the people, and upon his again expressing his approval of the death of Tiberius Gracchus, the people shouted out, “Down with the tyrant!” In the evening he went home with the intention of composing a speech for the following day; but next day he was found dead in his room. The most contradictory rumours were circulated respecting his death, but it was generally believed that he was murdered. Suspicion fell upon various persons; his wife Sempronia and her mother Cornelia were suspected by some; Carbo , Fulvius, and C. Gracchus by others. Of all these, Carbo was most generally believed to have been guilty, and is expressly mentioned as the murderer by Cicero. The general opinion entertained by the Romans of a subsequent age respecting Scipio is given by Cicero in his work on the Republic, in which Scipio is introduced as the principal speaker.</p>
 <p>(16) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Nasīca</hi>, that is, “Scipio with the pointed nose,” was the son of Cn. Scipio Calvus, who fell in Spain in B.C. 211. He is first mentioned in 204 as a young man who was judged by the Senate to be the best citizen in the State, and was therefore sent to Ostia along with the Roman matrons to receive the statue of the Idaean Mother, which had been brought from Pessinus. He was curule aedile in 196; praetor in 194, when he fought with success in Further Spain; and consul 191, when he defeated the Boii, and triumphed over them on his return to Rome. Scipio Nasica was a celebrated jurist, and a house was given him by the state in the Via Sacra, in order that he might be more easily consulted.</p>
 <p>(17) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Nasīca Corcŭlum</hi>, son of No. 16, inherited from his father a love of jurisprudence, and became so celebrated for his discernment and for his knowledge of the pontifical and civil law, that he received his surname of Corculum. He married a daughter of Scipio Africanus the elder. He was consul for the first time in 162, but abdicated, together with his colleague, almost immediately after they had entered upon their office, on account of some fault in the auspices. He was censor in 159 with M. Popilius Laenas, and was consul a second time in 155, when he subdued the Dalmatians. He was a firm upholder of the old Roman habits and manners, and in his second consulship he induced the Senate to order the demolition of a theatre, which was near completion, as injurious to public morals. When Cato repeatedly expressed his desire for the destruction of Carthage, <cb /> Scipio, on the other hand, declared that he wished for its preservation, since the existence of such a rival would prove a useful check upon the licentiousness of the multitude. He was elected Pontifex Maximus in 150.</p>
 <p>(18) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Nasīca </hi>Serapio , son of No. 17, is chiefly known as the leader of the Senate in the murder of Tiberius Gracchus. He was consul in 138, and in consequence of the severity with which he and his colleague conducted the levy of troops, they were thrown into prison by C. Curiatius, the tribune of the plebs. It was this Curiatius who gave Nasica the nickname of Serapio , from his resemblance to a person of low rank of this name; but, though given him in derision, it afterward became his distinguishing surname. In 133, when the tribes met to re-elect Tiberius Gracchus to the tribunate, and the utmost confusion prevailed in the Forum, Nasica called upon the consuls to save the Republic; but as they refused to have recourse to violence, he exclaimed, “As the consul betrays the State, do you who wish to obey the laws follow me;” and, so saying, he rushed forth from the temple of Fides, where the Senate was sitting, followed by the greater number of the senators. The people gave way before them, and Gracchus was assassinated as he attempted to escape. In consequence of his conduct on this occasion, Nasica became an object of such detestation to the people, that the Senate found it advisable to send him on a pretended mission to Asia, although he was Pontifex Maximus, and ought not, therefore, to have quitted Italy. He did not venture to return to Rome, and after wandering about from place to place, died soon afterwards at Pergamum.</p>
 <p>(19) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Nasīca</hi>, son of No. 18, was consul 111, and died during his consulship. (20) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Scipio Nasīca</hi>, son of No. 19, praetor in 94, is mentioned by Cicero as one of the advocates of Sextus Roscius of Ameria. He married Licinia, the second daughter of L. Crassus, the orator. He had two sons, both of whom were adopted, one by his maternal grandfather, L. Crassus, in his testament, and is therefore called L. Licinius Crassus Scipio, and the other by Q.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Σκιροφόρια</foreign>). An Athenian festival celebrated on the 12th of the month Scirophorion (June-July), called after it. It was in honour of Athené (or, according to some, Demeter and Koré), who was worshipped under the name of Sciras near Sciron, a spot on the Sacred Way leading from Athens to Eleusis. It had its name from the large white sunshade (<foreign lang="greek">σκίρον</foreign>) beneath which the priestess of Athené (the patron goddess of the city), the priest of Erechtheus, and the priest of Helios went to Sciron to sacrifice. The sunshade was a symbol of heavenly protection against the rays of the sun, which began to burn more intensely during the month of the festival. This protection was invoked with special reason, for the dry limestone rock was thinly covered by a meagre surface of soil in the neighbourhood of Athens, and particularly near Sciron itself. In this, as in other festivals of invocation, there were also expiatory offerings; and hence they carried in the procession the hide of a ram that had been sacrificed to Zeus as the mild and gracious deity.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σκόλιον</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">μέλος</foreign>). A short lyrical poem, usually consisting of a single strophe, and intended to be sung after dinner over the wine. The ancients ascribed its invention to Terpander, and it received its first development among the Lesbians, and was written by such masters of song as Alcaeus, Sappho, Praxilla, Timocreon, Simonides, and Pindar. The last mentioned, however, gave it a more artistic form, with several strophes, in accordance with the rules of Dorian lyric verse. This class of poetry found a congenial home in the brilliant and lively city of Athens, where, to the very end of the Peloponnesian War, it was the regular custom at banquets, after all had joined in the paean, to pass round a lyre with a twig of myrtle, and to request all guests who had the requisite skill to sing such a song on the spur of the moment. To judge from the specimens that have been preserved, their contents were extremely varied: invocations of the gods, gnomic sayings, frequently with allusions to common proverbs and fables, and the praises of the blessings and pleasures of life. The most famous scolion was that by a certain Callistratus on Harmodius and Aristogiton, who had killed the tyrant Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus. It consists of four strophes, but the last three are only variations of the first. See <ref type="cross" target="crossharmodius">Harmodius</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σκόπας</foreign>). (1) An Aetolian, who held a leading position among his countrymen at the period of the outbreak of the war with Philip and the Achaeans (B.C. 220). He commanded the Aetolian army in the first year of the war; and he is mentioned again as general of the Aetolians, when the latter people concluded an alliance with the Romans to assist them against Philip (211) (<bibl n="Liv.  36. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxvi. 24</bibl>). After the close of the war with Philip, Scopas and Dorimachus were appointed to reform the Aetolian constitution (204). Scopas had only undertaken the charge from motives of personal ambition; on finding himself disappointed in this object, he withdrew to Alexandria. Here he was received with the utmost favour by the ministers of the young king, Ptolemy V., and appointed to the chief command of the army against Antiochus the Great. At first he was successful, but was afterwards defeated by Antiochus at Panium, and reduced to shut himself up within the walls of Sidon, where he was ultimately compelled by famine 
<pb n="1430" /><cb />to surrender (<bibl n="J. AJ 12. 3.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Joseph. <title>Ant.</title>xii. 3. 3</bibl>). Notwithstanding this ill success he continued in high favour at the Egyptian court; but having formed a plot in 296 to obtain by force the chief administration of the kingdom, he was arrested and put to death (Polyb. xiii. 1; xvi. 18, 39).
 </p>
 <p>(2) A distinguished sculptor, a native of Paros, who appears to have belonged to a family of artists in that island. He flourished from B.C. 395 to 350. He was probably somewhat older than Praxiteles, with whom he stands at the head of that second period of perfected art which is called the Later Attic School (in contradistinction to the Earlier Attic School of Phidias), and which arose at Athens after the Peloponnesian War. Scopas was an architect and a statuary as well as a sculptor. He was the architect of the Temple of Athené Alea at Tegea, in Arcadia, which was commenced soon after B.C. 394. He was one of the artists employed in executing the bas-reliefs that decorated the frieze of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus in Caria. A portion of these bas-reliefs are now deposited in the British Museum. Among the single statues and groups of Scopas, the best known in modern times is his group of figures representing the destruction of the sons and daughters of Niobé. In Pliny's time the statues stood in the Temple of Apollo Sosianus (<bibl n="Plin.  36. 28" default="NO">Pliny, xxxvi. 28</bibl>). The remaining statues of this group, or copies of them, are all in the Florence Gallery, with the exception of the so-called Ilioneus at Munich, which some suppose to have belonged to the group. There is a head of Niobé in the collection of Lord Yarborough, which has some claim to be considered as the original. But the most esteemed of all the works of Scopas, in antiquity, was his group which stood in the shrine of Cn. Domitius in the Flaminian Circus, representing Achilles conducted to the island of Leucé by the divinities of the sea. It consisted of figures of Poseidon, Thetis, and Achilles, surrounded by Nereids, and attended by Tritons, and by an assemblage of sea monsters.

Scribonius Libo, who was the father-in-law of Sex. Pompey. Augustus married her in B.C. 40, on the advice of Maecenas, because he was then afraid that Sex. Pompey would form an alliance with Antony to crush him; but having renewed his alliance with Antony, Octavian divorced her in the following year (B.C. 39), on the very day on which she had borne him a daughter, Iulia, in order to marry Livia. Scribonia long survived her separation from Octavian. In A.D. 2 she accompanied, of her own accord, her daughter Iulia into exile to the island of Pandataria.

<head orig="Scythia">Scythia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σκυθιά</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">Σκυθικὴ</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">γῆ</foreign>). A name variously used by the ancients at different periods of history. The Scythia of Herodotus comprises, to speak generally, the southeastern parts of Europe, between the Carpathian Mountains and the river Tanaïs (Don). The Greeks became acquainted with this country through their settlements on the Euxine; and Herodotus, who had himself visited the coasts of the Euxine, collected all the information he could obtain about the Scythians and their country, and embodied the results in a most interesting digression, which forms the first part of his fourth book. He describes the country as a square of 4000 stadia (400 geographical miles) each way, the western boundary being the Ister (Danube) and the mountains of the Agathyrsi; the southern the shores of the Euxine and Palus Maeotis, from the mouth of the Ister to that of the Tanaïs, this side being divided into two equal parts, of 2000 stadia each, by the mouth of the Borysthenes (Dnieper); the eastern boundary was the Tanaïs, and on the north Scythia was divided by deserts from the Melanchlaeni, Androphagi, and Budini. It corresponded to the southern part of Russia in Europe. The people who inhabited this region were called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">Σκύθαι</foreign>, a word of doubtful origin, which first occurs in Hesiod; but, in their own language, <foreign lang="greek">Σκόλοτοι</foreign>, i. e. Slavonians. They were believed by Herodotus to be of Asiatic origin; and his account of them, taken in connection with the description given by Hippocrates of their physical peculiarities, has been regarded as proof that they were a part of the great Mongol race, who wandered, from unknown antiquity, over the steppes of Central Asia; yet the general drift of opinion at the present time is toward assigning to them Aryan affinities. Herodotus says further that they were driven out of their abodes in Asia, north of the Araxes, by the Massagetae; and that, migrating into Europe, they drove out the Cimmerians. If this account be true, it can hardly but have some connection with the irruption of the Cimmerians into Asia Minor, in the reign of the Lydian king Ardys, about B.C. 640.</p>
 <p>The Scythians were a nomadic people, that is, shepherds or herdsmen, who had no fixed habitations, but roamed over a vast tract of country at their pleasure, and according to the wants of their cattle. They lived in a kind of covered wagons, which Aeschylus describes as “lofty houses of wicker-work, on well-wheeled chariots” (<title>Prom. Vinc.</title> 710). They were filthy in their habits, never washing, fought on horseback, scalped their enemies, and drank out of their skulls when slain. They kept large troops of horses, and were most expert in cavalry exercises and archery; and hence, as the Persian king Darius found, when he invaded their country (B.C. 507), it was almost impossible for an invading army to act against them. They simply retreated, wagons and all, before the enemy, harassing him with their light cavalry, and leaving famine and exposure, in their bare steppes, to do the rest. Like all nomadic races, they were divided into several hordes, the chief of whom were called the Royal Scythians; and to these all the rest owned some degree of allegiance. Their government was a sort of patriarchal monarchy or chieftainship. An important modification of their habits had, however, taken place, to a certain extent, before Herodotus described them. The fertility of the plains on the north of the Euxine, and 
<pb n="1433" /><cb /> the influence of the Greek settlements at the mouth of the Borysthenes and along the coast, had led the inhabitants of this part of Scythia to settle down as cultivators of the soil, and had brought them into commercial and other relations with the Greeks. Accordingly, Herodotus mentions two classes or hordes of Scythians who had thus abandoned their nomad life; first, on the west of the Borysthenes, two tribes of Hellenized Scythians, called Callipidae and Alazones; then, beyond these, “the Scythians who are ploughers (<foreign lang="greek">Σκύθαι ἀροτῆρες</foreign>), who do not grow their corn for food, but for sale”; these dwelt about the river Hypanis (Boug), in the region now called the Ukraine, which is still, as it was to the Greeks, a great cornexporting country. Again, on the east of the Borysthenes were “the Scythians who are husbandmen” (<foreign lang="greek">Σκύθαι γεωργοί</foreign>), i. e. who grew corn for their own consumption: these were called Borysthenitae by the Greeks; their country extended <figure id="fig.01433">
<head orig="Scythian Horseman. (Sculptures at Kertch).">Scythian Horseman. (Sculptures at Kertch).</head>
</figure> three days' journey east of the Borysthenes to the river Panticapes. Beyond these, to the east, dwelt “the nomad Scythians (<foreign lang="greek">νομάδες Σκύθαι</foreign>), who neither sow nor plough at all.” Herodotus expressly states that the tribes east of the Borysthenes were not Scythian. Of the history of these Scythian tribes there is little to state, beyond the tradition already mentioned, that they migrated from Asia and expelled the Cimmerians; their invasion of Media, in the reign of Cyaxares, when they held the supremacy of Western Asia for twenty-eight years, and the disastrous expedition of Darius into their country. In later times they were gradually overpowered by the neighbouring people, especially the Sarmatians, who gave their name to the whole country. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssarmatia">Sarmatia</ref>.) Meanwhile, the conquests of Alexander and his successors in Central Asia had made the Greeks acquainted with tribes beyond the Oxus and the Iaxartes, who resembled the Scythians, and belonged, in fact, to the same race, and to whom, accordingly, the same name was applied. Hence, in writers of the time of the Roman Empire, the name of Scythia denotes the whole of Northern Asia, from the river Rha (Volga) on the west, which divided it from Asiatic Sarmatia, to Serica on the east, extending to India on the south. It was divided by Mount Imaüs into two parts, called respectively <hi rend="SmallCaps">Scythia intra Imaüm</hi>, i. e. on the northwestern side of the range, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Scythia extra Imaüm</hi>, on its southeastern side. The later Scythians overran Parthia (B.C. 128), and also invaded Northern India, where they maintained themselves for several centuries. The Jats and Rajputs of modern India have by some <cb /> scholars been regarded as the descendants of these Scythian invaders.</p>

This was followed by a prose version (<title>Opus Paschale</title>), laboured and bombastic in style; also by an elaborate comparison of the Old and New Testaments in fifty-five couplets, and a hymn to Christ in twenty-three quatrains of iambic dimeters, remarkable for the partial employment of rhyme as a musical element. The verses commence with the successive letters of the alphabet. Portions of this hymn have always been in use in the Church of Rome.

<div2 id="crossseianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Seiānus">Seianus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossaelius">Aelius</ref>. A Roman statesman, born at Vulsinii in Etruria. He was the son of Seius Strabo, who was commander of the praetorian troops at 
<pb n="1435" /><cb />
 the close of the reign of Augustus, A.D. 14 ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 1</bibl>). In the same year Seianus was made the colleague of his father in the command of the praetorian bands; and upon his father being sent as governor to Egypt, he obtained the sole command of these troops. He ultimately gained such influence over Tiberius that this suspicious man, who was close and reserved to all mankind, opened his bosom to Seianus, and made him his confidant. For many years he governed Tiberius; but, not content with this high position, he formed the design of obtaining the imperial power. With this view he sought to make himself popular with the soldiers, and gave posts of honour and emolument to his creatures and favourites. With the same object he resolved to get rid of all the members of the imperial family. He debauched Livia, the wife of Drusus, the son of Tiberius; and by promising her marriage and a participation in the imperial power, he was enabled to poison Drusus with her connivance and assistance (A.D. 23). An accident increased the credit of Seianus, and confirmed the confidence of Tiberius. The emperor, with Seianus and others, was feasting in a natural cave, between Amyclae, which was on the seacoast, and the hills of Fundi. The entrance of the cave suddenly fell in and crushed some of the slaves; and all the guests, in alarm, tried to make their escape. Seianus, resting his knees on the couch of Tiberius, and placing his shoulders under the falling rock, protected his master, and was discovered in this posture by the soldiers who came to their relief. After Tiberius had shut himself up in the island of Capreae, Seianus had full scope for his machinations; and the death of Livia, the mother of Tiberius (A.D. 29), was followed by the banishment of Agrippina and her sons Nero and Drusus. Tiberius at last began to suspect the designs of Seianus, and felt that it was time to rid himself of a man who was almost more than a rival. To cover his schemes and remove Seianus from about him, Tiberius made him joint consul with himself in A.D. 31. He then sent Sertorius Macro to Rome with a commission to take the command of the praetorian cohorts. Macro, after assuring himself of the troops, and depriving Seianus of his usual guard, produced a letter from Tiberius to the Senate, in which the emperor expressed his apprehensions of Seianus. The consul Regulus conducted him to prison, and the people loaded him with insult and outrage. The Senate on the same day decreed his death, and he was immediately executed. His body was dragged about the streets and finally thrown into the Tiber. Many of the friends of Seianus perished at the same time, and his son and daughter shared his fate ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 41</bibl>-59<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac.

The horns of the latter symbolized the crescent moon. In later times she was identified with Artemis (or else with Hecaté and Persephoné), as was Helios with Phoebus Apollo, and therefore was herself called Phoebé. After this she was also regarded as a huntress and archer, recognizable by her crescent as the goddess of the moon. She was worshipped on the days of the new and full moon. She bore to Zeus a daughter, Pandia, worshipped at Athens with her father at the festival of Pandia (Demosth. <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 21. 9" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>21. 9</bibl>).

 <p> and rarely <hi rend="bold">Seleucēa</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Σελεύκεια</foreign>). The name of several cities in Asia, built by Seleucus I., king of Syria. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Seleucia ad Tigrin</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἐπὶ τοῦ Τίγρητος ποταμοῦ, πρὸς Τίγρει, ἀπὸ Τίγριος</foreign>), also called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Seleucia Babylonia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Σ. ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι</foreign>), <hi rend="SmallCaps">Seleucia Assyriae</hi>, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Seleucia Parthōrum</hi>. A great city on the confines of Assyria and Babylonia, and for a long time the capital of Western Asia, until it was eclipsed by Ctesiphon. Its exact site has been disputed; but the most probable opinion is that it stood on the western bank of the Tigris, north of its junction with the Royal Canal, opposite to the mouth of the river Delas or Silla (Diala), and to the spot where Ctesiphon was afterwards built by the Parthians. It was a little to the south of the modern city of Bagdad. Perhaps a better site could not be found in Western Asia. It commanded the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the whole plain of those two rivers; and it stood at the junction of all the chief caravan roads by which the traffic between Eastern and Western Asia was carried on. In addition to these advantages, its people had, by the gift of Seleucus, the government of their own affairs. It was built in the form of an eagle with expanded wings, and was peopled by settlers from Assyria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Syria, and Iudaea. It rapidly rose, and eclipsed Babylon in wealth and splendour. Even after the Parthian kings had become masters of the banks of the Tigris, and had fixed their residence at Ctesiphon, Seleucia, though deprived of much of its importance, remained a very considerable city. In the reign of Titus, it had, according to <bibl n="Plin.  600" default="NO">Pliny, 600</bibl>,000 inhabitants. It was burned by Trajan in his Parthian expedition, and again by L. Verus, the colleague of M. Aurelius Antoninus, when its population is given by different authorities as 300,000 or 400,000. It was again taken by Severus, and from this blow it never recovered. In Julian's expedition it was found entirely deserted. See <bibl default="NO">Fabian, <title>De Seleucia Babylonia</title> (1869)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO">Schneiderwirth, <title>Seleucia am Tigris</title> (1874)</bibl>.</p>

A great city and fortress of Syria, founded by Seleucus in April, B.C. 300, one month before the foundation of Antioch. It stood on the site of an ancient fortress, on the rocks overhanging the sea, at the foot of Mount Pieria, about four miles north of the 
<pb n="1436" /><cb /> Orontes, and twelve miles west of Antioch. Its natural strength was improved by every known art of fortification, to which were added all the works of architecture and engineering required to make it a splendid city and a great seaport, while it obtained abundant supplies from the fertile plain between the city and The remains of Seleucus I. were interred at Seleucia, in a mausoleum surrounded by a grove. In the war with Egypt, which ensued upon the murder of Antiochus II., Seleucia surrendered to Ptolemy III. Euergetes (B.C. 246). It was afterwards recovered by Antiochus the Great (219). In the war between Antiochus VIII. and IX. the people of Seleucia made themselves independent (109 or 108). Afterwards, having successfully resisted the attacks of Tigranes for fourteen years (84-70), they were confirmed in their freedom by Pompey. The city had fallen entirely into decay by the sixth century of our era. There are considerable ruins of the harbour and mole, of the walls of the city, and of its necropolis. The surrounding district was called Seleucis.

It has remarkable claims to renown both in political and literary history—in the former as the place where Trajan and Frederick Barbarossa died; in the latter as the birthplace of the philosophers Athenaeus and Xenarchus, of the sophist Alexander, the secretary of M.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σέλευκος</foreign>). The name of several kings of Syria. (1) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossnicator">Nicātor</ref>, the founder of the Syrian monarchy, reigned B.C. 312-280. He was the son of Antiochus, a Macedonian of distinction among the officers of Philip II., and was born about B.C. 358. He accompanied Alexander on his <cb /> expedition to Asia, and distinguished himself particularly in the Indian campaigns. After the death of Alexander (323) he espoused the side of Perdiccas, whom he accompanied on his expedition against Egypt; but he took a leading part in the mutiny of the soldiers, which ended in the death of Perdiccas (321). In the second partition of the provinces which followed, Seleucus obtained the wealthy and important satrapy of Babylonia. In the war between Antigonus and Eumenes, Seleucus afforded efficient support to the former; but after the death of Eumenes (316), Antigonus began to treat the other satraps as his subjects. Thereupon Seleucus fled to Egypt, where he induced Ptolemy to unite with Lysimachus and Cassander in a league against their common enemy. In the war that ensued Seleucus took an active part. At length, in 312, he recovered Babylon; and it is from this period that the Syrian monarchy is commonly reckoned to commence. This era of the Seleucidae, as it is termed, has been determined by chronologists to the 1st of October, 312. Soon afterwards Seleucus defeated Nicanor, the satrap of Media, and followed up his victory by the conquest of Susiana, Media, and some adjacent districts. For the next few years he gradually extended his power over all the eastern provinces which had formed part of the empire of Alexander, from the Euphrates to the banks of the Oxus and <figure id="fig.01436">

In 302 he joined the league formed for the second time by Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander, against their common enemy Antigonus. The united forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus gained a decisive victory over Antigonus at Ipsus (301), in which Antigonus himself was slain. In the division of the spoil, Seleucus obtained the largest share, being rewarded for his services with a great part of Asia Minor (which was divided between him and Lysimachus) as well as with the whole of Syria, from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean.</p>
 <p>The empire of Seleucus was now by far the most extensive and powerful of those which had been formed out of the dominions of Alexander. It comprised the whole of Asia, from the remote provinces of Bactria and Sogdiana to the coasts of Phoenicia, and from the Paropamisus to the central plains of Phrygia, where the boundary which separated him from Lysimachus is not clearly defined. Seleucus appears to have felt the difficulty of exercising a vigilant control over so extensive an empire, and accordingly, in 293, he consigned the government of all the provinces beyond the Euphrates to his son Antiochus, upon whom he bestowed the title of king, as well as the hand of his own youthful wife, Stratonicé, for whom the prince had conceived a violent attachment. In 
<pb n="1437" /><cb /> 288, the ambitious designs of Demetrius (now become king of Macedonia) once more aroused the common jealousy of his old adversaries, and led Seleucus again to unite in a league with Ptolemy and Lysimachus against him. After Demetrius had been driven from his kingdom by Lysimachus, he transported the seat of war into Asia Minor, but he was compelled to surrender to Seleucus in 286. The Syrian king kept Demetrius in confinement till three years afterwards, but during the whole of that time treated him in a friendly and liberal manner. For some time jealousies had existed between Seleucus and Lysimachus; but the immediate cause of the war between the two monarchs, which terminated in the defeat and death of Lysimachus (281), is related in the life of the latter. Seleucus now crossed the Hellespont in order to take possession of the throne of Macedonia, which had been left vacant by the death of Lysimachus; but he had advanced no farther than Lysimachia, when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, to whom, as the son of his old friend and ally, he had extended a friendly protection. His death took place in the beginning of 280, only seven months after that of Lysimachus, and in the thirty-second year of his reign. He was in his seventy-eighth year. Seleucus appears to have carried out, with great energy and perseverance, the projects originally formed by Alexander himself for the Hellenization of his Asiatic empire; and we find him founding, in almost every province, Greek or Macedonian colonies, which became so many centres of civilization and refinement. Of these no less than sixteen are mentioned as bearing the name of Antiochia, after his father; five that of Laodicea, from his mother; seven were called after himself Seleucia; three from the name of his first wife, Apamea; and one Stratonicea, from his second wife, the daughter of Demetrius. Numerous other cities, whose names attest their Macedonian origin—Beroea, Edessa, Pella, etc.— likewise owed their first foundation to Seleucus.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Callinīcus</hi> (246-226), the eldest son of Antiochus II. by his first wife Laodicé. The first measure of his administration, or rather that of his mother, was to put to death his stepmother Berenicé, together with her infant son. This act of cruelty produced the most disastrous effects. In order to avenge his sister, Ptolemy Euergetes, king of Egypt, invaded the dominions of Seleucus, and not only made himself master of Antioch and the whole of Syria, but carried his arms unopposed beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris. During these operations Seleucus kept wholly aloof; but when Ptolemy had been recalled to his own dominions by domestic disturbances, he recovered possession of the greater part of the provinces which he had lost. Soon afterward Seleucus became involved in a dangerous war with his brother Antiochus Hierax, who attempted to obtain Asia Minor as an independent kingdom for himself. This war lasted several years, but was at length terminated by the decisive defeat of Antiochus, who was obliged to abandon Asia Minor and take refuge in Egypt. Seleucus undertook an expedition to the East, with the view of reducing the revolted provinces of Parthia and Bactria, which had availed themselves of the disordered state of the Syrian Empire to throw off its yoke. He was, however, defeated by Arsaces, king of Parthia, in a great battle, which was long after celebrated by <cb /> the Parthians as the foundation of their independence. After the expulsion of Antiochus, Attalus, king of Pergamus, extended his dominions over the greater part of Asia Minor; and Seleucus appears to have been engaged in an expedition for the recovery of these provinces, when he was accidentally killed by a fall from his horse, in the twenty-first year of his reign, 226. He left two sons, who successively ascended the throne, Seleucus Ceraunus and Antiochus, afterward surnamed the Great. His own surname of Callinicus was probably assumed after his recovery of the provinces that had been overrun by Ptolemy.
 </p>
 <p>(3) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ceraunus</hi> (226-223), eldest son and successor of Seleucus II. The surname of Ceraunus (“Thunderbolt”) was given him by the soldiery, apparently in derision, as he appears to have been feeble both in mind and body. He was assassinated by two of his officers, after a reign of only three years, and was succeeded by his brother, Antiochus the Great.</p>
 <p>(4) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Philopātor</hi> (187-175), was the son and successor of Antiochus the Great. The defeat of his father by the Romans, and the ignominious peace which followed it, had greatly diminished the power of the Syrian monarchy, and the reign of Seleucus was, in consequence, feeble and inglorious, and was marked by no striking events. He was assassinated in 175 by one of his own ministers. He left two children: Demetrius, who subsequently ascended the throne; and Laodicé, married to Perseus, king of Macedonia.</p>
 <p>(5) Eldest son of Demetrius II., assumed the royal diadem on learning the death of his father, 125; but his mother, Cleopatra , who had herself put Demetrius to death, was indignant at hearing that her son had ventured to take such a step without her authority, and caused Seleucus also to be assassinated.</p>
 <p>(6) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossepiphanes">Epiphănes</ref>, and also <ref type="cross" target="crossnicator">Nicātor</ref> (95-93), was the eldest of the five sons of Antiochus VIII. (Grypus). His uncle, who laid claim to the kingdom, was defeated and slain by him. Presently, however, Seleucus was himself expelled from Syria by Antiochus Eusebus. He retired to Cilicia, where he made himself master of the city of Mopsuestia, whose citizens presently revolted against him and burned the palace, in whose flames Seleucus himself perished.

<head orig="Semirămis">Semiramis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σεμίραμις</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Ninus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Νῖνος</foreign>). The mythical founders of the Assyrian Empire of Ninus or Nineveh. Ninus (the Greek name for Rimmon Mirari) was a great warrior, who built the town of Ninus or Nineveh about B.C. 2182, and subdued the greater part of Asia. Semiramis was the daughter of the fish-goddess Derceto of Ascalon in Syria by a Syrian youth; but, being ashamed of her frailty, she made away with the youth, and exposed her infant daughter. But the child was miraculously preserved by doves, who fed her till she was discovered by the shepherds of the neighbourhood. She was then brought up by the chief shepherd of the royal herds, whose name was Simmas, and from whom she derived the name of Semiramis. Her surpassing beauty attracted the notice of Onnes, one of the king's friends and generals, who married her. He subsequently sent for his wife to the army, where the Assyrians were engaged in the siege of Bactra, which they had long endeavoured in vain to take. Upon her arrival in the camp she planned an attack upon the citadel of the town, mounted the walls with a few brave followers, and obtained possession of the place. Ninus was so charmed by her bravery and beauty that he resolved to make her his wife, whereupon her unfortunate husband put an end to his life. By Ninus Semiramis had a son, Ninyas, and on the death of Ninus she succeeded him on the throne. According to another account, Semiramis had obtained from her husband permission to rule over Asia for five days, and availed herself of this opportunity to cast the king into a dungeon, or, as is also related, to put him to death, and thus obtained the sovereign power. Her fame threw into the shade that of Ninus; and later ages loved to tell of her marvellous deeds and her heroic achievements. She built numerous cities, and erected many wonderful buildings; and several of the most extraordinary works in the East, which were extant in a later age, and the authors of which were unknown, were ascribed by popular tradition to this queen. In Nineveh she erected a tomb for her husband, nine stadia high and ten wide; she built the city of Babylon, with all its wonders; and she constructed the hanging gardens of Media, of which later writers give us such strange accounts (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 184" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 184</bibl>). Besides conquering many nations of Asia, she subdued Egypt and a great part of Aethiopia, but was unsuccessful in an attack which she made upon India. After 
<pb n="1439" /><cb />
 a reign of forty-two years she resigned the sovereignty to her son Ninyas, and disappeared from the earth, taking her flight to heaven in the form of a dove. The fabulous nature of this narrative is apparent. It is probable that Semiramis was originally a Syrian goddess, perhaps the same who was worshipped at Ascalon under the name of Astarté, or the Oriental Aphrodité, to whom the dove was sacred. Hence the stories of her voluptuousness, which were current even in the time of Augustus (<bibl n="Ov. Am. 1. 5. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Ov. <title>Am.</title>i. 5, 11</bibl>). The stories that were current about Semiramis and Ninus are told by Diodorus Siculus, who drew largely upon <ref type="cross" target="crossctesias">Ctesias</ref> (q.v.).

<head orig="Senātus">Senatus</head>

 <p> The Roman Senate, or council of elders (<seg lang="la">senes</seg>), seems to have been, originally, an assembly of the chiefs of the different clans or houses (<seg lang="la">gentes</seg>), such as we find among nearly all Aryan peoples. Before the independent powers of these clans had been seriously diminished by the development <cb /> of the royal prerogative, this assembly was probably the highest authority in the community. In the earliest Roman tradition, however, its normal function is to advise the king, and, in certain cases, to approve or disapprove his propositions. Its members, the “fathers,” were chosen (<seg lang="la">lecti</seg>) by the reigning king; but the latter was bound by custom to choose them from the <seg lang="la">gentes</seg>, one representative of ripe age (<seg lang="la">maior natu</seg>) from each <seg lang="la">gens.</seg> The number of Senators therefore corresponded with the number of <seg lang="la">gentes</seg>, and it was only by the creation of new <seg lang="la">gentes</seg> that new elements could be introduced into the Senate (<seg lang="la">patres minorum gentium</seg>). Tarquin the Elder is said to have brought the Senate in this way to the strength which was subsequently regarded as normal—viz. three hundred. Upon the death of the king, and until his successor was chosen, the Senate assumed (or resumed) the government of the city, which it conducted through a series of senatorial <seg lang="la">interreges.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossinterreges">Interreges</ref>.</p>
 <p>With the establishment of the Republic the Senate became the council of the chief magistrates. Its members were selected at first by the consuls, later by the censors. For a century and a half it remained, essentially at least, a patrician body, and served as the chief bulwark of the patrician power. The tradition that plebeians were summoned to the Senate by the later kings is scarcely credible; the statement that the earlier consuls admitted them is almost equally questionable. It seems certain, at all events, that they were not regularly admitted, or admitted in any considerable number, until the middle or latter part of the fourth century B.C., when it was provided by a <title>lex Ovinia</title> that the censors should select <seg lang="la">ex omni ordine optimum quemque.</seg> The “best men” were interpreted, by usage, to be those who had been elected by the people to the higher magistracies; and ultimately the fact of election seems to have given the magistrate-elect seat and voice in the Senate. It was only when the list of ex-magistrates had been exhausted that others were appointed, preference being then given to citizens who had distinguished themselves in war. It was customary, at each census, to reappoint all surviving members of the Senate. The censors might indeed pass over (<seg lang="la">praeterire</seg>) the name of a senator, and thus exclude him, but only for cause stated. The Senate of the later Republic was accordingly a body of ex-magistrates, with what amounted to a life tenure.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Organization and Procedure</hi>.—As an advisory body, the Senate met only when its advice was required—i. e. upon the call of a magistrate. Meetings were usually (but not necessarily) held in the Curia Hostilia, and on the Kalends or the Ides. A <title>lex Pupia</title> forbade meetings of the Senate at times when the Comitia were assembled, and a <title>lex Gabinia</title> ordered daily meetings through the <ref id="n5" target="ref5"><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg><seg lang="la"></seg></ref>

 month of February for the transaction of foreign and diplomatic business. The quorum required seems to have varied with the nature of the business before the house; for dispensation from a law it was fixed at 200. Penalties were imposed for unexcused failure to attend.</p>
 <p>The magistrate who seeks the advice of the Senate (<seg lang="la">senatum consulit</seg>) acts as its chairman. He may lay before its members a distinctly formulated proposition which they are to approve or disapprove, or may submit (<seg lang="la">referre</seg>) a question on which their several opinions (<seg lang="la">singulae sententiae</seg>) are desired. In the latter case he calls upon the senators <seg lang="la">nominatim</seg>, in the order of their official rank—the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> or dean of the Senate first, then the excensors, then the <seg lang="la">consulares</seg>, and so on down to the <seg lang="la">quaestorii</seg>, observing within each rank the order of seniority. Each senator sets forth his opinion at such length as he sees fit. The speeches may be interrupted by questions or corrections, and these may give rise to a running debate (<seg lang="la">altercatio</seg>). If the opinion of the Senate is clear, no vote need be taken; if not, the magistrate formulates the question (<seg lang="la">verba facit</seg>) and takes the sense of the Senate by a division (<seg lang="la">discessio</seg>). Senators who had held no elective office had the right of voting only, not the right of speech; hence they were termed “foot-senators” (<seg lang="la">pedarii</seg>). A number of questions might, of course, be submitted to the Senate at a single session. The order of business depended upon the pleasure of the magistrate, with one exception—<seg lang="la">res divinae</seg> took precedence of <seg lang="la">res publicae.</seg></p>
 <p>The Senate had neither secretaries nor, until the time of Iulius Caesar, records. The decision reached was written out by the presiding magistrate with the aid of a committee of senators. Except during the struggle between the orders, when the <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg> were kept in the temple of Ceres, the place of deposit was the <seg lang="la">aerarium.</seg></p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Powers</hi>.—The advice of the Senate had to be obtained on certain matters of especial gravity, and might be obtained whenever it was desired. In theory, the advice that it gave was not binding, either upon the king or the republican magistrates. In fact, however, a resolution of the Senate, if less than a command, was much more than a counsel. Under the kings the Senate represented organizations older than the monarchy or the State itself. In its later republican form it included all the political experience and nearly all the political influence of the commonwealth. In the royal and early republican periods it was the guardian of the sacred traditions of the people. In the later Republic it represented, as against the magistrates with their brief terms and division of functions, as against the people with their varying impulses, the permanency and the unity of the policy of the State. In those matters in which custom accorded to its opinion the highest authority—in matters of religion, for example, and in questions of war and peace—it was practically a revolutionary act for the king or the magistrates to proceed in a course which the Senate discountenanced. Both in the royal period, therefore, and under the Republic, the Senate exercised an important restraining influence. In the later republican period its influence became more positive. It had, indeed, no organs for the enforcement of its will except the magistrates in office; but these seldom dared to refuse their aid. Most of them were members <cb /> of senatorial families and had obtained office through family influence. To cross the will of the Senate was to imperil their own careers and those of their sons. During the conflict between the orders, the Senate had lost much of its authority; but when, at the close of this conflict, it was so reorganized as to include the leading representatives of all the great families, plebeian as well as patrician, it became more powerful than ever before. In the last two centuries of the Republic, in consequence of the increasing importance of Rome's foreign relations, which it had always directed, and the multiplication of subject-provinces which were under its special supervision, the Senate became the supreme power in the State. The selfish use of this power provoked the democratic reaction which established the Empire.</p>
 <p>Among the rights attributed to the Senate, at one time or another, were the preliminary discussion of bills (<seg lang="la">rogationes</seg>) before their submission to the people; the examination and approval of the list of candidates for election; the quashing of popular resolves and of elections because the proper forms (particularly those required by religion) had not been observed; dispensation from laws in special cases, and the granting of privileges (especially corporate privileges); and, finally, the suspension of the ordinary laws in periods of stress and peril. In the early Republican period, the Senate claimed the right of ultimate approval or disapproval of laws and elections, but these claims were negatived by the <title>lex Publia</title> (B.C. 339) and the <title>lex Maenia</title> (B.C. 287). As regarded the provincial subjects of Rome, <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg> had the force of laws.</p>
 <p>For a time the Senate exercised a sort of criminal jurisdiction, especially in the case of religious and political offences, through investigating committees (<seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>); but these “questions” were ultimately transformed into permanent courts and made independent of the Senate.</p>
 <p>In the field of administration the Senate exercised full control over the public finances. It fixed the taxes to be collected and the manner of their collection, voted appropriations, examined and verified the accounts of the treasury officials. It controlled the entire provincial administration. In the field of foreign relations nothing was done without its authorization. It sent and received ambassadors (<seg lang="la">legati</seg>), and conducted or controlled all diplomatic negotiations. It heard and acted upon the complaints of the allied cities and adjusted their differences. In the later Republican period wars were declared and treaties of peace and of alliance were ratified by the Comitia; but it was regarded as unconstitutional to bring these matters before the people without the previous authorization of the Senate.</p>
 <p>In the republican, as in the royal, period the Senate carried on the government in case of <seg lang="la">interregnum.</seg> An <seg lang="la">interregnum</seg> existed, according to the republican theory, when both consuls died or resigned.</p>
 <p>Finally, the Senate claimed an indefinite right of watching over and providing for the weal of the State (<seg lang="la">salus rei publicae</seg>), and it exercised an undisputed supremacy in strictly religious matters, except where these fell within the competence of the special priestly colleges.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Senate of the Empire</hi>.—With the establishment of the Empire the powers of war and of 
<pb n="1441" /><cb />
 peace and the control of Rome's foreign relations passed from the Senate to the emperor. Half of the provinces were ruled by the emperor's legates, and over the government of the rest he exercised an effective control. An imperial <seg lang="la">fiscus</seg> and an imperial war-treasury (<seg lang="la">aerarium militare</seg>) were established, and under Nero imperial praefects took the place of the senatorial quaestors in the old <seg lang="la">aerarium.</seg> On the other hand, the Senate gained new powers at the cost of the popular assembly: it passed laws and elected the magistrates. It also obtained a criminal jurisdiction concurrent with that of the ordinary courts. Some of these powers were afterwards withdrawn; but the bestowal and the withdrawal were alike matters of form. The substance of power was with the emperor: the magistrates from whom the Senate was still recruited were his nominees, and their election by the Senate was simply a ratification of the imperial choice. By virtue of his censorial powers, moreover, he could purge and reconstruct the Senate as he pleased. Senators were appointed more and more frequently without the form of election to any magistracy, and the number of provincials in the Senate steadily increased. The title <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg>, which the emperor assumed, obtained a new meaning: it indicated that he was the permanent president of the Senate.</p>
 <p>The transfer of legislative power to the Senate carried with it one prerogative of great apparent importance—that of appointing the new emperor when the office became vacant, or at least of clothing him with imperial power. This right also proved unsubstantial: the succession was regularly determined either by the will of the deceased emperor or by the will of the army. The passing of the <seg lang="la">lex de imperio</seg> became as purely formal as the other acts of the Senate.</p>
 <p> Sulla had raised the number of senators to 400; Iulius Caesar to 900. Augustus fixed it at 600. Regular meetings were held on the Kalends and Ides of each month. At first an attendance of 400 was required. It soon became necessary to increase the penalty of unexcused absence and also to reduce the legal quorum.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Ordo Senatorius</hi>.—The fact that the Senate was regularly recruited from a limited number of families had given to these families, even in the republican period, something of the character of a class. The formal distinctions accorded to the senators themselves (<seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg>, reserved seats at spectacles, etc.); their exclusion, not only from revenue-farming and other contracts with the government, but also from trade, and the extension of these prohibitions to the sons of senators, were steps towards the legal recognition of a senatorial order. In the imperial period this movement was completed. The senatorial census or property qualification was fixed at one million sesterces. The formal and ceremonial distinctions of the senators were multiplied, and were extended to their families. Class privileges were accorded them. Marriages between children of senators and persons of servile origin (<seg lang="la">libertini</seg>), previously regarded as unsuitable, were made illegal.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Municipal Senates</hi>.—In the self-governing cities of Italy and of the provinces, the whole municipal government was modelled on that of Rome, and the constitutions and functions of their city senates, or municipal councils in particular (<seg lang="la">decuriones</seg>, <cb /> <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>), were closely analogous to those of the Roman Senate.</p>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius Annaeus</hi> (the praenomen being uncertain), usually called Seneca Rhetor to distinguish him from his more celebrated son, was a native of Corduba in Spain. His birth may be placed about B.C. 60 and his death shortly after that of Tiberius (A.D. 37). His family was of equestrian rank and in good circumstances: his character, as revealed in his writings and described by his son, was marked by sobriety, industry, and sternness. We know little of his life, except that he resided on two occasions at least and for several years at Rome, where he is usually supposed, though on insufficient evidence, to have practised as a speaker and professor of rhetoric, without, however, attaining any very high distinction. He informs us that, except Cicero, he had listened to all the great masters of Roman eloquence; and Cicero he might have heard had he been willing to brave the risks of a visit to Rome while the Civil Wars were raging. But then, as for the greater part of his long life, he preferred the quiet dignity of his estate in Spain; and it was there that, when well advanced in middle age, he married Helvia, a lady of good lineage and ancient virtue, by whom he had three sons, all of whom attained distinction—Novatus, better known as the Gallio of the Acts of the Apostles; Seneca the philosopher; and Mela , father of the brilliant poet Lucan.</p>
 <p>Seneca was the author of a Roman history extending from the commencement of the Civil Wars to the close of the reign of Tiberius. To this work two allusions—one in Lactantius ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 7. 15. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>vii. 15. 14</bibl>) and one in Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 73" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tib.</title>73</bibl>) — must be referred. From the former we gather that, like Tacitus, he commenced his history by a brief generalizing retrospect of Rome's entire past, in which he compared the various epochs of her development to those of a human life. Lucius Seneca, in a fragment of a lost biography of his father, claims for it a place among the literary monuments of the age; but with some diffidence, as if conscious that his filial piety overpowered his critical judgment. At all events, we hear nothing of it from any other source. His other work, a series of reminiscences of contemporary rhetoricians, written in his old age, has, to a great extent, survived. It consists of ten books of <title>Controversiae</title>, or discussions of legal cases, and one book of <title>Suasoriae</title>, or themes for rhetorical declamation. The <title>Suasoriae</title> were written last, but come first in order of publication from grounds of educational convenience. The commencement is lost. The first, second, ninth, and tenth books of <title>Controversiae</title>, with their prefaces, are almost perfect. The gaps in the other books are partially filled up by an abridgment (<seg lang="la">excerpta</seg>) of the fourth or fifth century, the prefaces to books v., vi., and viii., however, being lost. These prefaces are by far the most interesting portion of the work. They are written by Seneca in his own person, and contain, 
<pb n="1442" /><cb /> besides pleasant commonplaces and sallies of genial humour, many valuable criticisms of the different speakers quoted, expressed in a pure and classical Latin. The <title>Controversiae</title>, which are almost entirely made up of quotations, are for the most part treated under three heads: first, the <title>Sententiae</title>, or opinions of the rhetoricians as to the applicability of the law to the question proposed; second, the <title>Divisio</title>, or distribution of the legal argument into its various points or subdivisions, each of which is considered separately; and thirdly, the <title>Colores</title>, or pleas for consideration, which, while admitting the fact, extenuate its gravity or alter its legal complexion.</p>
 <p>It is evident that a considerable proportion of the rhetorical quotations was in Greek, declamatory exercises being indifferently undertaken in either language; but as the book was used exclusively in the Western Empire, the Greek portions were to a great extent discarded, and but few are now preserved. It is remarkable that Seneca himself displays a purer taste and literary style than any of the rhetoricians he quotes, in most of whom the characteristics of the Silver Age are already prominent.</p>
 <p>The subjects of the <title>Suasoriae</title> are of the kind ridiculed by Juvenal: “Shall Alexander cross the ocean to find a new world to conquer?” “Shall Cicero plead with Antony for his life?” “Shall Leonidas withdraw from Thermopylae?” etc. They are mere school exercises, and, though ingenious and often eloquent, can hardly be called profitable reading.</p>

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Annaeus</hi>, second son of the preceding, was born at Corduba about B.C. 3. He was from infancy of a delicate constitution, and liable to serious illnesses, in one of which he owed his life to the devoted care of his maternal aunt, in whose company, he tells us, he was brought to Rome. His instructors there were the eminent philosophers <cb /> Fabianus, Attalus, and Sotion , under whom he studied with unremitting ardour, carrying his zeal for their precepts so far as to cultivate a somewhat ostentatious asceticism. His prudent father, alive to the jealousy of the court, recommended less perilous forms of virtue. Caligula, who affected to be a severe critic of Seneca's style, unquestionably envied his talent, and had marked him out for destruction, but was induced to spare his feeble health, which seemed to threaten an early grave. Under Claudius, Seneca rapidly rose to eminence. As quaestor he had the promise of a political career opened to him. He was also a successful pleader, a skilful professor of eloquence, and a leader in the world of fashion. But he had made powerful enemies. An intimacy was known to exist between him and Iulia Livilla, youngest daughter of Germanicus, which was liable to an unfavourable construction; so that when Messalina by her intrigues effected the exile of the princess, she was able to involve Seneca in a similar fate (A.D. 41). He was banished to Corsica, where he spent eight years, a fretful and helpless spectator of events. With the downfall of Messalina his fortunes revived. Agrippina, wishing to use him as the instrument of her ambitious projects, and perhaps, as Dio insinuates, captivated by his engaging person, contrived to secure his appointment as tutor to her son, the young Nero, then eleven years of age, and already destined for the throne. This was a position exactly suited to Seneca's genius. There is every reason to believe that he endeavoured to imbue his pupil's mind with maxims of wisdom and clemency; and the early part of Nero's reign, the “golden <seg lang="la">quinquennium</seg>” of justice and mercy, was long remembered as due to the influence of Seneca and Durrus, who jointly administered the State. It soon became evident, however, that Nero could not be controlled. The tutor tried to retain his influence by dangerous and unworthy concessions to the vices of the pupil, but without success. It was Nero who held Seneca bound by the magnetism of fear, of a more violent will, and of imperial splendours. The minister was compelled to follow the downward course of Nero's policy, giving such colour as his practised rhetoric afforded to its odious features till Agrippina's murder—the motive of which he was called upon to embody in a state-paper—brought the climax to a long series of inconsistencies between profession and practice, and showed him at once the moral hollowness and the actual insecurity of his position. From this time Nero seems to have turned against him; and although the long-foreseen blow did not descend until A.D. 65, when Piso's conspiracy gave a decent pretext for accusing him, yet for several years Seneca had been prepared for death, and had made generous, but ineffectual, attempts to disarm the emperor's malice. Bidden to effect his own death, the philosopher, with his high-born and beautiful wife Paulina, who insisted on dying with him, opened his veins. Paulina was restored by her friends to life, though with difficulty: he, after suffering excruciating agony, which he endured with cheerfulness, discoursing to his friends on the glorious realities to which he was about to pass, was at length suffocated by the vapour of a stove.</p>
 <p>Seneca is undoubtedly the most brilliant figure of his time, and, except Tacitus, the most important 
<pb n="1443" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01443">
<head orig="So-called Bust of Seneca the Philosopher. (Naples Museum.)">So-called Bust of Seneca the Philosopher. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> thinker and writer of the post-Augustan Empire. He embodied all the leading characteristics of the age, with which, unlike the majority of Roman citizens, he was in thorough harmony; and consequently he has been judged with more prejudice even by posterity than might have been expected.</p>
 <p>That he was a truly great or good man can scarcely be maintained; that he was even a great thinker is open to question; but the inconsistencies of a life passed amid such overpowering temptations must not blind us to his real earnestness of purpose, or to the merit of exercising, under constant risk, a restraining influence on perhaps the vilest character known to history. It is impossible to doubt Seneca's love for virtue. Amid exaggerations, conceits, paradoxes, follies, the moral end is always held out as the only one worthy of being consistently followed, to which every kind of speculative knowledge is subordinate. His death, though not without a conscious study of effect, was a truly noble one; and we must believe him sincere when, on comparing himself with others and reconsidering his actions and omissions, he declares that he can look back with satisfaction upon his life. His opinion, thrice expressed, to the effect that true wisdom will not seek for an impracticable standard of purity in a hopelessly corrupt age, must be referred to the lower level of moral excellence, which Stoicism considered alone compatible with public life, and not to the ideal of the unencumbered, untempted sage.</p>
 <p>Of Seneca's poetical writings, some few epigrams are preserved in the <title>Anthologia Latina.</title> We possess also nine tragedies correctly ascribed to him, viz.: <title>Hercules Furens, Troades</title> (or <title>Hecuba), Phoenissae</title> (not all genuine), <title>Medea, Phaedra</title> (or <title>Hippolytus), Oedipus, Agamemnon, Thyestes</title>, and <title>Hercules Oetaeus</title>, and one <seg lang="la">praetexta</seg>, the <title>Octavia</title>, <cb /> incorrectly ascribed. Doubts have been thrown on the identity of the tragedian with the philosopher, but they are quite unfounded. The tragedies no doubt belong to his earlier life, and probably were written, partly during his exile, partly after his return to Rome, to assist the poetic proclivities of Nero. They are free imitations of Greek originals, which have in most cases survived so as to admit of a comparison. Both in dramatic power and loftiness of tragic feeling the Latin plays are immeasurably inferior. They abound, however, in brilliant declamation, philosophic contemplation, and witty aphorisms. They can hardly have been intended for the stage, to which they are wholly unsuited; but they are admirably fitted for declamatory reading, though even for this purpose overloaded with rhetoric.</p>
 <p>Seneca's prose works were numerous and important; a considerable portion are lost, but the larger and more valuable part remains. Among the former are his speeches, written to be delivered by Nero, a treatise <title>De Situ Indiae</title>, another <title>De Situ et Sacris Aegypti</title>, another <title>De Motu Terrarum;</title> several treatises on moral philosophy, viz.: <title>Exhortationes, De Officiis, De Immatura Morte, De Superstitione, De Matrimonio, Quo Modo Amicitia Continenda Sit, De Paupertate, De Misericordia, De Remediis Fortuitorum</title>, and <title>De Verborum Copia;</title> a biography of his father, a panegyric on Messalina, and several books of letters. His extant works comprise (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the twelve so-called dialogues, viz.: <title>Ad Lucilium de Providentia, Ad Serenum de Animi Tranquillitate, Ad S. de Otio, Ad S. de Constantia Sapientis, Ad Novatum de Ira Libri III., Consolatio ad Marciam, Consolatio ad Polybium, Consolatio ad Helviam Matrem, De Vita Beata ad Gallionem, De Brevitate Vitae ad Paulinum; (b)</title> three books, <title>Ad Neronem de Clementia; (c)</title> seven books, <title>De Beneficiis ad Aebutium Liberalem; (d)</title> twenty books of moral letters, <title>Ad Lucilium</title> (but the collection is incomplete); (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) seven books, <title>Naturales Quaestiones</title>, addressed to Lucilius; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) a political satire on the death and apotheosis of Claudius, called by <foreign lang="greek">διο ἀποκολοκύντωσις</foreign>, which is of interest as the only remaining example of the Satura Menippea; (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) fourteen spurious letters of a correspondence with St. Paul, which seem to have imposed upon St. Jerome (<title>De Vir. Illust.</title> 12). See <ref type="cross" target="crossepistola">Epistola</ref>.</p>
 <p>From this catalogue it will be seen how wide was the field embraced by Seneca's genius. Little need be said about his scientific works, except that they show no mean acuteness of conjecture and considerable knowledge of physical theories, though these are often subordinated to an ethical purpose. His views of nature are in the main Stoic, and his examples are probably drawn from Greek sources.</p>
 <p>It is on his moral treatises that Seneca's fame rests. In the particular department that he selected, viz., the application of certain leading principles to practical life, he excels all other writers of antiquity. Nominally a Stoic, he belonged really to the Eclectic School, culling precepts from every form of doctrine with impartial appreciation. “The remedies of the soul,” he says, “have been discovered long ago: it is for us to learn how to apply them.” On this text his system is a comment. It requires, above all else, a thorough knowledge of the human heart, and in this Seneca is preëminent. In that dark and perilous period, when universal mistrust prevailed, 
<pb n="1444" /><cb />
 the moralist must be able to dive into the secret recesses of the soul, drawing to light its hidden disquiet, and fortifying it against the blows of circumstance or the deeper thrusts of human turpitude. No writer, ancient or modern, shows a more complete mastery of the pathology of mind. Many of his letters are of the nature of sermons; others are spiritual meditations; others, brilliant attacks on the falsehood and vice of the time. In all these is the same incisiveness of style, the same fertility of illustration, the same varied experience, the same emphatic and reiterated pressing home of his point. This last feature is apt to weary the reader; and Seneca, well aware of the danger, endeavours, by every artifice of rhetorical ingenuity, to maintain the interest of his theme. “To impress the dull conscience, reiteration is a necessity: to knock once at the door when night is come is never enough: you must knock frequently and hard.” This leads him to use a tone of exaggeration which, by its seeming insincerity, does injustice to the writer's heart, and has caused him to be too severely judged. His religious and moral maxims so often approximate to those of Christianity that the fathers of the church adopted the view that he had adopted their faith, to which the fictitious correspondence with St. Paul seemed to lend support. The coincidences, however, though sufficiently remarkable, are accidental only, and arise from the character of his mind, which was essentially that of a “seeker after God.”</p>

 <p> A powerful people in Gallia Lugdunensis, dwelling along the upper course of the Sequana (Seine). Their chief town was Agendicum, afterwards called Senones (Sens) ( <title>B. G.</title> ii. 2). A portion of this people crossed the Alps about B.C. 400, in order to settle in Italy, and took up their abode on the Adriatic Sea between the rivers Utis and Aesis (between Ravenna and Ancona), after expelling the Umbrians. In this country they founded the town of Sena. They not only extended their ravages into Etruria, but marched against Rome and took the city, B.C. 390. From this time we find them engaged in constant hostilities with the Romans, till they were at length completely subdued, and the greater part of them destroyed by the consul Dolabella in B.C. 283.

 <p> A tomb. Sepulchres cut in the rock were in common use among both the Greeks and the Romans, and in many places, especially in Lycia and in Asia Minor, they are found in vast numbers, some of them being highly ornate and elaborate. In Lycia they are generally built in imitation of a wooden building, and reproduce in stone the minutest details of wood-construction. The interior consists of a low chamber with stone couches, upon which the bodies were placed. Tombs in form like a sarcophagus (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssarcophagus">Sarcophagus</ref>) are also found, some of them with an arch as in the annexed example. Others are in the shape of a high square column or pedestal with a projecting cornice, as in the so-called Harpy Monument now in the British Museum. Temple-tombs or heroa (<foreign lang="greek">ἡρω_α</foreign>) also occur in Asia Minor, these having a central chamber on a high base (<seg lang="la">podium</seg>), surrounded by a colonnade. The highest development of this sepulchral type is seen in the famous Mausoleum at Halicarnassus in Caria, a restoration of which is shown in the illustration on p. 1018. For elaborate rock-cut tombs, see the illustration in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmyra">Myra</ref>, p. 1069. An early form of tomb apparently much favored in Greece was the domed or “bee-hive” tomb, in which a large chamber is built in a circular form of courses of stone which gradually overlap so as to form a dome-shaped building, though not a true dome. The space for this chamber is excavated in the side of a hill and is approached by a stone-lined passage (<foreign lang="greek">δρόμος</foreign>) cut into the slope of the hill. The best example of such a tomb is the so-called Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, shown on p. 452. <figure id="fig.01445">

 <p>The tombs of the Etruscans were nearly always subterranean, consisting of chambers hewn out of the rock either below the surface of the earth or projecting horizontally into a cliff. The earliest Etruscan tombs date from the sixth century B.C. Temple-tombs also occur of which the following illustration gives an example.</p>
 <p>The Etruscan tombs generally imitated the <figure id="fig.01445.2">
<head orig="Etruscan Temple-tomb at Norchia.">Etruscan Temple-tomb at Norchia.</head>
</figure> abode of the living; they are frequently adorned with paintings, and the bodies recline upon stone couches accompanied by vases and other objects, as shown in the illustration on the following page.</p>
 <p>The Roman tombs were usually placed by the side of the roads leading out of the city, many of which are still preserved, among them the pyramidal tomb of C. Cestius, near the Porta Ostiensis <bibl default="NO">(see illustration, p. 1346)</bibl>, the tomb of Caecilia Metella <bibl default="NO">(see illustration, p. 1037)</bibl> on the Appian Way, and the tomb of the Scipios, also on the Appian Way. The most splendid of the Roman sepulchral edifices that still remain is the Mausoleum of Hadrian, shown in the illustration on p. 1018.</p>
 <p>Another style of Roman tomb built to contain a large number of bodies was the <seg lang="la">columbarium</seg>, consisting of a building containing a large number of niches, flat at the bottom and arched at the top, each niche as a rule being intended to hold two urns (<seg lang="la">ollae</seg>). The <seg lang="la">columbarium</seg> used for the burial of the servants and freedmen of the emperor Augustus, and especially of the empress Livia, on the Appian Way, contained room for upwards of 3000 <seg lang="la">ollae.</seg> See Lanciani, <title>Ancient Rome</title>, pp. 129, 130; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumbarium">Columbarium</ref>.</p>
 <p>Bodies were also interred in graves. The normal form of the Greek grave was that familiar to us— a hole or trench dug in the ground. In Attica in early times the dead were buried in their own houses ( <bibl n="Plat. Minos 315" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Minos</title>, 315</bibl>D), but the later rule was for the interment to take place outside of the city walls, frequently by the side of the roads as at Rome. The Roman laws of the Twelve Tables forbade burial within the city, though exceptions were made in the case of distinguished persons— e. g. C. Fabricius ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 58). The Vestal Virgins and the emperors were also buried within the city. The Romans used besides trenches deep pits like wells (hence the name <seg lang="la">puticuli</seg>, from <seg lang="la">puteus</seg>, a well). Etruscan graves were frequently lined with stone. Gravestones were of various sorts both in Greece and Italy: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">κόνισκοι</foreign>, or

 <p>The bodies, if burned, were placed in urns or in earthenware coffins, such as are shown in the following illustration. Within the tombs were always placed objects of all kinds, often of considerable value, and these are an extremely important source of knowledge regarding ancient arts, such as pottery, vase-painting, jewelry, gem-engraving, terracotta work, etc. The contents of tombs have also included strigils, swords, perfume-bottles, lamps, needles, pins, mirrors, rings, brooches, wreaths, diadems, and vessels for food, in some of which bits of food are still actually preserved. <figure id="fig.01446.4">

<head orig="Serapis. (Vatican.)">Serapis. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> icent temple of Serapis, the Serapeum. By the elimination of foreign elements, the conception of the god was so widely extended as to include the Egyptian Osiris, the Greek Pluto, the Greek god of healing, Asclepius, and Zeus-Iupiter. This new worship (together with the cult of Isis) rapidly spread from Egypt over the Asiatic coast, the Greek islands, and Greece itself, and found a firm footing even in Rome and Italy, in spite of repeated interference on the part of the State. Under the Empire, particularly in the time of Hadrian, it extended throughout the Roman world. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossisis">Isis</ref>.) There was a fine temple to Serapis at Puteoli, of which remains still exist. <cb /></p>
 <p>Serapis was especially worshipped as a god of healing, and with his temples were connected dream-oracles that were much resorted to. He was represented, like Pluto, with an animal by his side, having the head of a dog, lion, or wolf, and a serpent coiled round its body. As Zeus-Serapis he is to be seen in the colossal bust in the Vatican, with a <seg lang="la">modius</seg>, or corn-measure, the symbol of the lower world, upon his head.

<head orig="Sermo Plebēius">Sermo Plebeius</head>

 <p> A term used, in contradistinction to the classic Latinity of Cicero or Caesar, to designate the speech of the common people, at Rome and in the provinces, which later became the basis of the modern Romance languages. Its relation to literary Latin has been subject to frequent misconception: thus, the two are not separate languages, although too often erroneously so termed; nor, on the other hand, is the Sermo Plebeius in any sense either the parent or the offspring of the classic speech. They are rather two kindred dialects, which, while steadily diverging, trace their origin to a common source in the speech of early Rome, the <title>prisca Latinitas.</title></p>
 <p>The differentiation between the popular and cultured speech begins properly with the early Roman poets; for, prior to the birth of a national literature, the language lacked the stability essential to a linguistic standard. It is noteworthy that Livius Andronicus, Naevius, and Ennius were all of them natives of Magna Graecia, and that accordingly Rome owes her first impulse in literature, as in the other arts, to external sources. These literary pioneers naturally regarded their native Greek as the highest criterion of excellence, and strove successively to impart something of its ease and grace to the rather unwieldy forms and heavy quantities of archaic Latin. The process of refining and polishing the language in accordance with Greek rules was continued by the famous literary circle which centred in the younger Scipio, to an extent best realized by a comparison of the plays of Terence, whose style is all but Ciceronian, with those of Plautus, which remain the best surviving specimens of early plebeian Latin.</p>
 <p>Classic Latin, thus carefully fostered, culminated <cb /> at length in the cadenced prose of Cicero and the harmonious rhythm of the Augustan poets—a proud achievement for the grammarians, but gained at the expense of the vitality of the language. Its growth had been checked before its natural resources were developed. Its vocabulary remained deficient; its rules for accent and quantity were borrowed; its later development was so largely artificial as to be necessarily unstable. Even in Livy and Tacitus there are seen the beginnings of the decadence which was destined to blight the later literature, and which was hastened by the steady encroachment of the Sermo Plebeius.</p>
 <p>The latter, rude and untrammelled, was free to enlarge its vocabulary and modify its constructions to meet the needs of the people's slowly broadening horizon. It was essentially the language of the shops and streets, of the soldier and camp-follower, the slave and rustic—in short, of all but the privileged literary class. In the early period, the reciprocal influence exerted by the two diverging branches of the language was slight, for the literary circle was strictly limited, while the great mass of the people lived and died untouched by the new culture. Gradually, however, as knowledge became more general, and facilities for learning increased, the influence of the cultured language filtered slowly downward through the different grades of society, until all except the remoter rural districts must have felt the leaven of its influence. Conversely, the Sermo Plebeius, with its expressive slang phrases and hardy neologisms, became a more and more convenient source to draw upon, so that with each generation a larger proportion of plebeian forms and constructions found their way upward into the cultured speech. Hence arose a compromise, in the shape of the <seg lang="la">sermo cotidianus</seg>, the free-and-easy medium of every-day life, which facilitated communication between the classes, and into which the most cultured speakers were apt to relapse when conversing with their family and friends. Below this, down to the <seg lang="la">lingua rustica</seg>, the rudest form of the country districts, the language shaded off through numerous gradations, all possessing the same essential characteristics, and differing only in degree. The furthest division of the language which, with our present knowledge, it is safe to make is threefold—into <seg lang="la">sermo urbanus, sermo cotidianus</seg>, and <seg lang="la">sermo plebeius.</seg></p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Provincial Latin</hi>.—The history of the Sermo Plebeius in the provinces presents certain peculiar features, which are noteworthy because they go far towards explaining the origin of those dialectic differences which resulted in the separate Romance languages. It was always the policy of Rome to force her speech, as well as her customs, upon the nations that she subjugated, and to that end Latin was made the official language of the provinces. The standard of Latinity, however, was not so easily regulated, the conquered people naturally acquiring it from the Romans with whom they earliest came in immediate contact—the common soldiers, petty officials, itinerant merchants, the rank and file that followed in the track of the successful armies. Accordingly, while provincial Latin is far from being synonymous with the Sermo Plebeius, and while many of the leading families must have spoken as pure a Latin as any heard at Rome, yet the plebeian element was more marked, more universal, extending higher in the social ranks, and even giving a distinctive local 
<pb n="1449" /><cb />
 colour to provincial literature. The important point, however, is that, while the different provinces were acquired at long intervals, the Sermo Plebeius, which thus formed successively the basis of African, Spanish, and Gallic Latin, was itself undergoing a slow but constant evolution, and the form which Caesar's legions introduced into Gaul was very different from the speech of the soldiers who, a century earlier, had followed the younger Scipio to Carthage. It would be absurd to claim that the language, once established in a province, became crystallized, never to change again. On the contrary, and notably in the case of the African Latin, the later development is most striking; but, owing to its comparative isolation from the influence of the classic speech, plebeian Latin in the provinces tended to preserve certain archaic features much longer than at Rome, a condition quite analogous to that observed in the French of Quebec, or the English of the New England colonies. Accordingly, the Latin of the several provinces represents a varying degree of archaism, in the order of their dates of conquest; and one may search in vain in the Gallic writer Marcellus Empiricus for many of the archaisms prevalent in the works of the Africans Tertullian, Arnobius, and Caelius Aurelianus. The dialectic differences thus established played a far larger part than did any of the rapidly supplanted native tongues, in the ultimate separation of the Romance languages. Thus, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalonian, Provençal, French, and Roumanian show, in the order given, successive stages of the Sermo Plebeius, while Italian, representing the vulgar speech in its native land, where its ultimate development was reached, is the most advanced of all, excepting in the dialectic forms spoken in the island of Sardinia, Rome's earliest external conquest, which retain to this day many characteristics, such as accented ĭ and ŭ, and the <hi rend="italic">k</hi>-sound after <seg lang="la">e</seg> and <seg lang="la">i</seg>, which must have been lost from the plebeian Latin at an early date, as they are wanting in the other Romance languages.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Sources</hi>.—The sources for our knowledge of the Sermo Plebeius are fairly abundant, but of very diverse degrees of importance. No one deliberately wrote in vulgar Latin, but only when, through carelessness or ignorance, he failed to attain the classic standard. Even the language of Plautus's slaves, and the realistic dialogue of Trimalchio and his <seg lang="la">colliberti</seg> in the <title>Satira</title> of Petronius, are softened to meet the exigencies of literature. Accordingly, the characteristics of plebeian speech must be gleaned from isolated statements of Roman grammarians, errors of orthography and syntax found in inscriptions, or in writers of inferior Latinity, and lastly from the corroborative evidence of the Romance languages. The testimony of Roman writers, however, although of the first importance, is extremely meagre, dealing largely with anomalies of vocabulary and style. The only ancient work bearing directly upon the subject, of which we have knowledge, that of T. Lavinius <title>De Verbis Sordidis</title>, has unfortunately perished. The most important existing document of this class is the curious grammatical fragment, the <title>Appendix Probi</title> (contained in the <title>Grammatici Latini</title>, ed. Keil), but whether of general, or merely local, authority is uncertain, for although some authorities regard it as an African production, its source is still problematic. <cb /></p>
 <p>Among inscriptions the most important are the Pompeian wall inscriptions (in the <title>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</title>, vol. iv.), comprising the careless scribblings of schoolboys, slaves, etc., on houses and public buildings, and containing many important clues to popular Latin in Southern Italy. The inscriptions from Gaul, Spain, and Africa are also useful in tracing dialectic changes. But the chief value of inscriptions, wherever found, is for the light they throw upon plebeian pronunciation, since the ignorant stone-cutters often spelled as they pronounced, and, unlike the equally ignorant scribes, left their errors recorded in an enduring form.</p>
 <p>Turning to literature, we find a mass of material, which needs, however, careful discrimination. The scanty remnants of the early writers are all valuable, for plebeian Latin preserved many features of the <title>prisca Latinitas</title> long after they had been discarded by the classic speech; and in the Augustan age archaism was to a large extent synonymous with vulgarism. Plautus and the other early comic poets are of especial value, since their works were intended for the people and are accordingly written down to their level. Even Terence contains a certain plebeian element which had probably become traditional on the comic stage. Cato , famous as the opponent of Greek culture, naturally favoured the earlier and ruder form of speech, and his <title>De Agricultura</title> forms our unique source for the early <seg lang="la">sermo rusticus.</seg></p>
 <p>For the classic and Silver Latin period, material is more abundant. The <title>Bellum Hispaniense</title> and other supplements to Caesar's <title>Commentarii</title> are probably mild specimens of the <seg lang="la">sermo militaris.</seg> Cicero, elsewhere the standard of Latinity, assumes in his letters, as he himself confesses, a more colloquial tone: <hi rend="italic">Quid tibi ego in epistolis uideor? Nonne plebeio sermone agere tecum? (Ad </hi> <bibl n="Cato Fam. 9. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> Fam.ix. 21</bibl>); and they remain our best example of the <seg lang="la">sermo cotidianus</seg> of the upper classes. Satire, from its very nature and origin, required a less elevated style than other forms of poetry, and the satires of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal all afford a fruitful source for vulgarisms. There are also numerous writers on technical subjects, skilful in their several provinces, but weak in point of grammar: thus the architect Vitruvius, who would write correctly if he could, apologizes for his ignorance and begs that <seg lang="la">si quid parum ad regulam artis grammaticae fuerit explicatum ignoscatur</seg> (i. 1, 17). The elder Pliny , whose <title>Historia Naturalis</title> is confessedly a literary mosaic, is a treasure-house of plebeian vocabulary. The chief source, however, in anteHadrian Latin is and must remain the <title>Cena Trimalchionis</title> of Petronius, the narrative of which is told in the easy colloquial language of the upper classes, while the conversation of Trimalchio's circle is fairly redolent with vulgarisms, popular proverbs, and the current slang of the streets. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspetronius">Petronius</ref>.</p>
 <p>For post-classical Latin the entire range of literature is useful: for although departures from the classic norm must not be indiscriminately stigmatized as plebeian, few writers of the decadence escaped some taint of popular Latin. Of especial interest are Fronto, Gellius, and Apuleius, whose numerous archaisms are due as much to the <title>sermo Africus</title> as to the retrogressive movement begun under the emperor Hadrian. The later African writers are also of great importance, notably Tertullian, 
<pb n="1450" /><cb /> Arnobius, Commodian, and Augustine; for although African Latin has left no modern representative, it was the great vitality of that idiom which imprinted upon ecclesiastical Latin its distinctive character, and thus indirectly imparted a tinge, especially in vocabulary and syntax, to the modern Romance languages.</p>
 <p>As specimens of very late Latin, where the language is on the verge of disintegration, Anthimus, the historians Fredegarius and Gregory of Tours, and the <title>Regula Monachorum</title> of St. Benedict, recently edited by Wölfflin <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1895)</bibl>, are very instructive.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. Characteristics of Plebeian Latin</hi>.—<title>(a) Phonetics.</title>—The main changes occur in the vowelsystem. Latin originally possessed five vowels— <seg lang="la">a, e, i, o, u</seg>—which might be long or short. Plebeian Latin, however, gives early proof of a growing qualitative difference, long vowels tending to become close, short vowels open. That all qualitative difference was eventually lost appears from the Romance languages, and is further evidenced by the growing frequency of false quantities in Christian poets after the third century (Commodian, Ausonius, Dracontius, etc.), and by the substitution of stress accent for metrical accent in late popular songs. Owing to such changes, <hi rend="italic">ĭ</hi> tended early to merge in <hi rend="italic">ē</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ŭ</hi> in <hi rend="italic">ō</hi> soon after: see Varr. <title>R. R.</title> 1, 2, 14, <seg lang="la">rustici viam veham appellant</seg>, and the admonitions of  <bibl n="Stob. App. 197" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>197</bibl><bibl n="Stob.

Similarly the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ae, au</hi>, tended to weaken to <seg lang="la">e, o:</seg> see Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 97, <title>in Latio rure “edus”; qui in urbe, ut in multis, a addito, aedus;</title> <bibl n="Fest.  202" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest.202</bibl><bibl n="Fest.  13" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 13</bibl>, <seg lang="la">orata, genus piscis, appellatur a colore auri quod rustici “orum” dicebant, ut auriculas “oriculas”</seg> (compare the Ital. <seg lang="la">povero, toro;</seg> Span. <seg lang="la">pobre, toro</seg>=Lat. <seg lang="la">pauper, taurus</seg>). Unaccented <hi rend="italic">au</hi>, closely followed by <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, weakened to <seg lang="la">a:</seg> see Caper, 108, 6, <seg lang="la">ausculta, non “asculta”</seg> (compare the Ital. <title>Agosto</title>, Fr. <title>Août</title>=Lat. <title>Augustus</title>). A result of the stress accent was frequent syncope of unaccented vowels, notably between liquids and mutes: see  <bibl n="Stob. App. 198" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>198</bibl><bibl n="Stob. App. 3" default="NO"> App., 3</bibl>, <seg lang="la">calida, non “calda,” frigida, non “frigda”</seg> (compare <hi rend="italic">domnus=dominus</hi> [Plaut.], <hi rend="italic">mattus=maditus</hi> [Petr. ], and Ital. <seg lang="la">caldo, freddo</seg>, Fr. <hi rend="italic">chaud, froid</hi>). From the second century, a prosthetic <seg lang="la">i</seg> became frequent before <hi rend="italic">st, sc, sp</hi>, etc., mainly in inscriptions, and has survived to some extent in the Romance languages (compare Fr. <seg lang="la">étude, écrire</seg>=Lat. <seg lang="la">studium, scribere</seg>).</p>
 <p>The majority of Latin consonants have passed unaltered into the Romance language and exhibit few distinctly plebeian features. The most important changes, the assibilation of <hi rend="italic">ti</hi> before a vowel and of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <seg lang="la">e</seg> and <seg lang="la">i</seg>, belong to the latest period of Latinity. In post-Hadrian Latin <seg lang="la">b</seg> became confounded with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (comp. forms like <title>Berecundus, inbicto, berbeces</title>, from the second-century inscriptions;  <bibl n="Stob. App. 198" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>198</bibl><bibl n="Stob.

The aspirate was frequently misapplied, as to-day in Cockney English: Catullus ( <bibl n="Catul. 84" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>84</bibl>) ridicules forms like <hi rend="italic">chommoda, hinsidias</hi> as a vulgar affectation (cf. <hi rend="italic">Nigid. ap.</hi> <bibl n="Gel.  13.6.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii.6.3</bibl>, <seg lang="la">rusticus fit sermo si aspires perperam;</seg> Caper, vii. 102, 12, <seg lang="la">alica, non “halica”</seg>). Final consonants were often neglected. Thus final <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, lightly sounded even in classic Latin, was disregarded in the popular speech (cf.  <bibl n="Stob. App. 199" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>199</bibl><bibl n="Stob. App. 14" default="NO"> App., 14</bibl>, <seg lang="la">passim, non “passi”; numquam, non “numqua”; pridem, non “pride”; olim, non “oli”</seg>). <cb /> The failure of final <hi rend="italic">s</hi> to make position, a usage common in early poetry, had become “<seg lang="la">subrusticum</seg>” in Cicero's day (<title>Orator</title>, 48, 161): its omission becomes frequent in the second-century inscriptions. In Pompeian wall inscriptions final <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is sometimes wanting (comp. forms like <seg lang="la">ama, valia, peria</seg>). The Sermo Plebeius carried assimilation much further than the classic speech: <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> was probably due to Osco-Umbrian influence.  <bibl n="Stob. App. 197" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>197</bibl><bibl n="Stob. App. 24" default="NO"> App., 24</bibl>, <seg lang="la">“candela,” non “cannela,”</seg> and forms like <hi rend="italic">dispennite</hi> (Plaut.), <title>verecunnus (Inscrr. Pomp.)</title>, with Oscan <hi rend="italic">upsannam</hi>=Lat. <seg lang="la">operandum.</seg> Such forms are now common in the Neapolitan dialect. <hi rend="italic">tt</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ct</hi> is found in the fourth century inscriptions—e. g. <hi rend="italic">lattucae, ottobris</hi> (cf.  <bibl n="Stob. App. 198" default="NO"> <title>App.</title>198</bibl><bibl n="Stob. App. 30" default="NO"> App., 30</bibl>: <seg lang="la">auctor, non “auttor,”</seg> and Ital. <hi rend="italic">notte, ottavo, pittore</hi>=Lat. <seg lang="la">noctem, octavus, pictor. tt</seg> for <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> is seen in inscriptional forms, such as <title>Settembris, scritus</title> (cf. Ital. <title>Settembre, scritto); ss</title> for <hi rend="italic">sp</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">ps.</hi> Comp. also the vulgar form <hi rend="italic">issa</hi> for <seg lang="la">ipsa</seg> in Martial (i. 1 [9]): <hi rend="italic">scriserunt (Inscr.)</hi>; Ital. <hi rend="italic">scrissi.</hi></p>
 <p><title>(b) Word-Formation.</title>—The contrast between the Romance languages and classic Latin is nowhere sharper than in vocabulary. Many familiar classic words have vanished, plebeian forms surviving in their place; so the vulgar <seg lang="la">bucca, caballus</seg>, have replaced <seg lang="la">os</seg> (gen. <seg lang="la">oris), equus</seg> (cf. the French <foreign lang="fr">bouche, cheval;</foreign> Ital. <foreign lang="it">bocca, cavallo</foreign>). Still oftener the simple Latin word has survived only in a derivative form, a condition due to the plebeian fondness for ponderous derivatives and compounds. The popular language was burdened with substantives in -<seg lang="la">bulum, -mentum</seg>, and -<hi rend="italic">monium</hi>, and adjectives in -<seg lang="la">bundus, -lentus</seg>, and -<seg lang="la">osus;</seg> frequentative, inchoative, and desiderative verbs, diminutives, and prepositional compounds all abounded. Everywhere the effort was apparent to compensate by volume of sound for native poverty of thought. Such derivatives often differed but slightly, if at all, in meaning from the simple word, as the Romance languages testify (cf. the French <foreign lang="fr">abeille, corbeille</foreign>, from Lat. diminutives <seg lang="la">apicula, corbicula</seg>; <foreign lang="fr">chanter, jeter</foreign>, from frequentatives <seg lang="la">cantare, iactare</seg>). Through such misuse, words tended to wear out quickly, and it became necessary to reinforce them. Hence arose double diminutives, like <seg lang="la">homullulus, lapillulus;</seg> double frequentatives, like <seg lang="la">cantitare, ductitare;</seg> verbs with reduplicated prepositions, as <seg lang="la">con-colligere, per-per-ire</seg>, etc. The same fondness for lengthened forms is seen in the numerous compound suffixes resulting from secondary derivation, such as -<hi rend="italic">bili-tas, -osi-tas, -tor-ius, -ill-are</hi>, or by deliberate compounding of separate endings, as -<seg lang="la">astellus, -ul-aster, -idini-tas, -eli-tas.</seg> Furthermore, the two processes of composition and derivation are used in combination; a growing proportion of derivative verbs are compounded with prepositions, while the growing tendency to derive substantives and adjectives from compound verbs by preference gave rise to such forms as <seg lang="la">stultiloquentia, vaniloquentia</seg> (Plaut.), <seg lang="la">circumspicientia</seg> (Gell. ), <seg lang="la">disconvenientia, impraescientia, subtililoquentia</seg> (Tert. ), <hi rend="italic">suffumigatorius, superinunctorius</hi> (Cass. Fel. ); and such were often further compounded, notably with <seg lang="la">in</seg>- privative. Comp. <seg lang="la">inrecogitatio</seg> (Tert. ), <hi rend="italic">incoinquinabilitas</hi> ( Rusp.Fulg. ).</p>
 <p><title>(c) Inflection.</title>—The radical process by which case-forms and tense-endings were largely replaced in the Romance languages by prepositions and periphrastic conjugations belongs under the head 
<pb n="1451" /><cb /> of syntax. The following are the principal anomalies of plebeian inflection: transfers from the fourth declension to the second, and from the fifth to the first, even in Plautine Latin, thus anticipating the loss of the fourth and fifth in Romance languages. Comp. <seg lang="la">senatus, -i, tumultus, -i, ecfigia</seg> for <seg lang="la">effigies</seg> (Plaut.); transfers from the third declension to second: cf. <seg lang="la">vasum, ossum</seg> (Plaut.), <seg lang="la">pauper, a, um</seg> (Plaut., Petr. ), and Ital. <seg lang="la">vaso, osso, povero.</seg> Substitutions of nominal endings in pronominal declension: <hi rend="italic">ipsus, istus;</hi> gen. sing. <seg lang="la">isti, ulli;</seg> dat. sing. fem. <seg lang="la">aliae, totae</seg> (all in Plaut.). Numerous irregular comparatives and superlatives, made from superlative forms, as <seg lang="la">postremior, extremior</seg> (Apul. ), <seg lang="la">extremissimus</seg> (Tert. ), <hi rend="italic">minissimus</hi> (Arnob.), or from other words not usually compared in classic Latin, as <seg lang="la">ipsissimus, geminissimus, patruissimus</seg> (Plaut.), <seg lang="la">pathicissimus</seg> (Mart. ), <hi rend="italic">caenidior</hi> (Catull.). Adverbs in -<seg lang="la">ter</seg>, formed irregularly from adjectives in -<hi rend="italic">us: avariter, firmiter, largiter</hi> (Plaut.), <seg lang="la">improbiter</seg> (Petr. ). The use of active forms, in place of deponent verbs: cf. <seg lang="la">laeto, opitulo</seg> ( Andr.), <seg lang="la">ioco, nicto</seg> (Plaut.), <seg lang="la">aemulo</seg> (Apul. ), <seg lang="la">carnifico, vesco</seg> (Tert. ).

The unusual formation of certain perfects with the normal ending -<seg lang="la">ivi:</seg> cf. <seg lang="la">posivi, institivi, potivi</seg>, etc. Similarly the use of the normal imperatives <seg lang="la">face, duce</seg>, etc., for usual <seg lang="la">fac, duc.</seg></p>
 <p><title>(d) Syntax.</title>—Neuter nouns tended to become masculine, more rarely feminine: cf. <seg lang="la">caelus, fatus, vinus, triclinia</seg> (Petr. ), and the loss of the neuter in Ital., Span., etc. From the Romance standpoint, great importance attaches to the tendency to develop syntax at the expense of inflectional forms. Thus case-constructions were gradually replaced by prepositions: the partitive genitive by <seg lang="la">de</seg>, the dative of indirect object by <seg lang="la">ad</seg>, the instrumental ablative by <seg lang="la">cum.</seg> From early times the accusative tended to assume the functions of other cases— e. g. of the ablative after <seg lang="la">utor, fruor, fungor</seg>, etc., or of the dative after verbs of pleasing, trusting, etc. Gradually a confusion arose between the cases, and we find <seg lang="la">in</seg> construed indifferently with accusative or ablative; later <seg lang="la">cum, de, ex</seg> occur with the accusative; <seg lang="la">ante, per</seg>, etc., with the ablative. Adjectives were compared with the help of adverbs, such as <seg lang="la">bene, magis, plus:</seg> cf. Fr. <hi rend="italic">bien joli</hi>, Span. <seg lang="la">mas grande</seg>, Ital. <seg lang="la">più forte.</seg> There was a tendency to use the verbs <seg lang="la">esse, habere</seg> as auxiliaries to form periphrastic tenses. The uses of the subjunctive mood were gradually curtailed: from the time of Plautus the indicative occurs in indirect questions, and in later Latin purpose is often expressed by the infinitive. Conversely, the infinitive with <seg lang="la">verba sentiendi et declarandi</seg> is constantly replaced by the indicative (more rarely the subjunctive) with <seg lang="la">quod, quia, quoniam</seg> in post-classic Latin: cf. <seg lang="la">dixi quod mustella comedit</seg> (Petr. ), Fr. <seg lang="la">j'ai dit que</seg> . . . Finally, plebeian Latin is partial to double negatives: <seg lang="la">nemini nihil satis est</seg> (Petr. ); cf. Ital. <seg lang="la">non fa niente</seg>, Fr. <hi rend="italic">je n'ai point.</hi></p>

<head orig="Sertorius">Sertorius</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossquintus">Quintus</ref>. One of the most extraordinary men in the later times of the Roman Republic. He was a native of Nursia, a Sabine village, and was born of obscure but respectable parents. He served under Marius in the war against the Teutones; and before the battle of Aquae Sextiae (Aix), in B.C. 102, he entered the camp of the Teutones in disguise as a spy, for which hazardous undertaking his intrepid character and some knowledge of the Keltic language well qualified him. He also served as <seg lang="la">tribunus militum</seg> in Spain under T. Didius (97). He was quaestor in 91, and had before this time lost an eye in battle. On the outbreak of the Civil War in 88 he declared himself against the party of the nobles, and commanded one of the four armies which besieged Rome under Marius and Cinna ( <title>B. C.</title> i. 67). He was, however, opposed to <cb /> the bloody massacre which ensued after Marius and Cinna entered Rome.</p>
 <p>In 83 Sertorius was praetor, and either in this year or the following he went into Spain, whence he crossed over to Mauretania, and gained a victory over Paccianus, one of Sulla 's generals. After this, at the request of the Lusitanians, he became their leader, and for some years successfully resisted all the power of Rome. He availed himself of the superstitious character of that people to strengthen his authority over them. A fawn was brought to him by one of the natives as a present, which soon became so tame as to accompany him in his walks and attend him on all occasions. After Sulla had become master of Italy, Sertorius was joined by many Romans, and among the rest by M. Perperna, with fifty-three cohorts. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossperperna">Perperna</ref>.) To give some show of form to his formidable power, Sertorius established a Senate of 300, into which no provincial was admitted. The continued want of success on the part of Metellus, who had been sent against Sertorius in 79, induced the Romans to send Pompey to his assistance, but with an independent command. Pompey arrived in Spain in 76 with a large force (30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry), but was unable to gain any decisive advantages. For the next five years Sertorius kept both Metellus and Pompey at bay, and cut to pieces a large number of their forces. Sertorius was at length assassinated at a banquet in 72 by Perperna and some other Roman officers, who had long been jealous of his authority.

 <p> Where one person has a right over property of another, which he can assert by legal remedy against any one who interferes with its exercise, and not merely against the owner of the property, he is said to have a <seg lang="la">ius in re aliena</seg>, and his right belongs to those which are “real” or <seg lang="la">in rem.</seg> By the existence of such a right the legal position of the owner is diminished in value: his ownership, which otherwise would be unrestricted, is curtailed, not in duration, but in extension. The presumption of law was in favour of the freedom of property, and the burden of proving his right over it lay on the other party: hence, when a thing was sold as <seg lang="la">optima maxima</seg>, this was legally understood to mean that it was warranted free from any real rights in persons other than the owner (Dig. 50, 16, 90, and 169). Two classes of such 
<pb n="1453" /><cb />
 rights are known to Roman law: one recognized by the old Ius Civile, and termed <seg lang="la">servitutes;</seg> the other of praetorian origin, and known by specific names—viz. <title>Emphyteusis, Pignus</title>, and <title>Superficies.</title> See the articles under these heads. Servitutes are either personal or praedial. Of the first class are <seg lang="la">habitatio</seg> or the right of living in another person's house; and <seg lang="la">operae servorum</seg> or <seg lang="la">animalium</seg>, the right of using his slaves or animals. Among praedial servitutes are that <seg lang="la">oneris ferendi</seg>, the right to use a wall or edifice of his neighbour as a support for his own; <seg lang="la">proiciendi</seg>, the right to allow one's balcony to project over his neighbour's land; <seg lang="la">cloacae immitendae</seg>, the right of running a drain through a neighbour's premises, etc. The modern term for <seg lang="la">servitutes</seg> is “easements.” See <bibl default="NO">Schonemann, <title>Die Servituten</title> (1866)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO">Molitor, <title>La Possession et les Servitutes en Droit Romain</title> (1851)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δοῦλος</foreign>). I. In <ref type="cross" target="crossgreece">Greece</ref>, besides a class of serfs like the Penestae of Thessaly and the Helots of Sparta, who had come to this condition through being conquered in war, we find, even in Homeric times, actual slaves not differing greatly from freemen. They seem to have been possessed in large numbers only by princes and chieftains, who either obtained them as booty on expeditions (<foreign lang="greek">δοριάλωτοι</foreign>), or bought them from such predatory adventurers as the Phoenicians (<title>Odyss.</title> xv. 483). In historic times the institution of slavery was very much developed, so that there is scarcely a State in which even the poorer citizens did not own a male or female slave to do the rough work considered unworthy of a free man ( <title>Plut.</title> init.). In Attica, when the State was in its most flourishing condition, there were some 400,000 slaves, or about four times the number of the free citizens (Ctesicles <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Athen. vi. p. 272 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>). The Greeks justified slavery, much as did our antebellum teachers, by alleging that there were certain barbarians who had been intended by nature to be slaves. As a matter of fact, the slaves in Greece were for the most part barbarians by race. In exceptional cases, Greeks also were captured in war, and were thus reduced to permanent slavery; but, as a rule, they were exchanged or freed on the payment of a ransom. The countries of Asia Minor, Thrace, and the northern regions comprehended under the name of Scythia sent the greatest numbers to the slave-markets, of which the most important were at Delos, Chios, and Byzantium. Athens also had a slave-market, especially used by citizens who wished to expose undesirable slaves for sale. Most of the slaves in Attica were such as had been born from female slaves. The wealthy sometimes possessed several hundreds of <cb /> them, of whom, naturally, only a part would be kept in the house. Some of the remainder worked on farms in the country, while others served on the merchantmen as rowers or sailors, others in the mines at Laurium, while others again, either singly or in numbers in a manufactory and under a superintendent, were engaged in some trade on their master's account. The owners also sometimes let out slaves to others, as in our Southern States before the war. Domestic slaves were employed in every conceivable kind of occupation in the house, and were also intrusted with the education of the boys, whom they had to accompany everywhere, especially to the school and to the palaestra; such slaves were called <foreign lang="greek">παιδαγωγοί</foreign>. Indeed, as a rule, even the commonest Greek, if he could possibly manage it, never went out unescorted by a slave; while, if he was rich, a number of slaves followed him. At the same time, no Greek seems to have had the vast collection of slaves that many Romans had under the Empire. Fifty was regarded as a large number, though Nicias owned as many as 1000 or more ( <title>De Vect.</title> 4). The chief difference, however, between the Greek and Roman view of slavery is that the Greeks regarded the slave as a labourer and an industrial necessity, while the Romans used him chiefly as a minister to their personal pleasures. See the remarks at the end of the present article, and cf. Athen. vi. p. 272 <seg lang="la">e.</seg></p>
 <p>Their treatment differed according to the character and the pecuniary position of the owner, and also depended upon their own good qualities and usefulness. In general, the Athenians were noted for showing more kindness to their slaves than did the rest of the Greeks. There were laws also that referred to them, and protected them against excessive caprice and harshness. But they had no legal rights; they could neither bring a charge nor appear as witnesses. It was only when they were put to the torture (<foreign lang="greek">βασανίζειν</foreign>) that their evidence had any weight attached to it. But the master could not kill a slave unless the latter had been condemned in a law-court; otherwise he had to pay a penalty to some divinity. If cruelly treated, a slave could seek protection, usually in the temple of Theseus, and claim to be sold to another master. In case of maltreatment by a stranger, the master could bring a legal action, and obtain heavy damages. Slaves had no particular dress prescribed for them by law; but they were not allowed to let their hair grow long. They were not prohibited from entering temples and sanctuaries or from taking part in the public religious festivals; but they were excluded from the use of the gymnasia and from the assemblies of the people. Manumissions were not rare, especially such as were made by a clause in the owner's will, or if slaves bought their freedom with the savings made by permission of the master. Sometimes manumission was a reward for giving information about grave crimes, or for distinguished service in war; for slaves were not unfrequently employed in military service, especially in the fleet as rowers and sailors, or as marines. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnavis">Navis</ref>.) (For the position of the liberated slaves, see <ref type="cross" target="crosslibertus">Libertus</ref>.) At Athens there was also a special class of public slaves (<foreign lang="greek">δημόσιοι</foreign>). Chief among them were those called Scythae or archers, at first 300, then 600, and finally as many as 1200; the name Speusinii was also given them from a certain Speusinus, who is 
<pb n="1454" /><cb />
 said to have established this institution (Pollux, viii. 132, and the <title>Etymologicum Magnum</title>). They served as police, and their duties were at first confined to the market-place, but afterwards were extended to the Areopagus. They were further employed for military purposes, like the similar corps, also consisting of public slaves, of 200 mounted archers (<foreign lang="greek">ἱπποτοξόται</foreign>). The lower servants of the State officials, such as criers, scribes, jail-keepers, and hangmen, were mostly (the last-mentioned always) public slaves, and so were the workmen at the mint. Their position was one of much greater freedom than that of the private slaves, and did not differ greatly from that of the <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemosii">Demosii</ref>.</p>
 <p>II. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi>, like the Greeks, possessed slaves from the earliest times; but their number was at first trifling, on account of the small households of the old Romans and their simple manner of life. But great estates gradually became frequent, and slaves were used by preference for agricultural work, because they were not subject to levy for military service. Luxury became more general, and a number of wants, previously unknown, were created by it; and in course of time the custom of employing slaves for industrial purposes was borrowed from the Greeks. All this caused a continual increase in the number of slaves, until in some cases they were collected in several thousands. Some of these were born in the house, and were called <seg lang="la">vernae;</seg> they were regarded as particularly faithful and trustworthy, and enjoyed certain liberties accordingly. The remainder were for the most part acquired among the spoils of war, or were introduced from other countries where slaves were kept. Those taken in war were sold by the quaestor either on the spot immediately or at the nearest market-place, or, according to the technical terms, either <seg lang="la">sub hasta</seg> (“under the lance”) or <seg lang="la">sub corona</seg> (“under the wreath,” which was placed on the head of captives in war to show that they were for sale). For this purpose slave-dealers (<seg lang="la">mangones</seg>), whose profitable trade was regarded with contempt, were always represented in the train of Roman armies. They also bought slaves in great numbers at the principal slave-marts, as at Rome and Delos. At Rome, the aediles superintended this kind of business, on which the government levied a tax for import and a further tax on the sale. The slave was placed on a platform (<seg lang="la">catasta</seg>), with his feet whitened with chalk or gypsum, if he had just come across the sea ( <bibl n="Juv.  1. 111" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 111</bibl>), and with a label (<seg lang="la">titulus</seg>) round his neck, showing his home, age, abilities, and bodily defects, if any, the vendor being responsible for the correctness of these statements; if he would not bind himself in any such way, this was shown by placing a cap (<seg lang="la">pilleus</seg>) on the slave's head. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspilleus">Pilleus</ref>.) Slaves distinguished for their beauty, their skill, or their literary or musical accomplishments, were not exhibited publicly, but in special places, and to such as were able to pay the prices for them, which frequently ran very high. Those born in the house were also sold by private agreement, without being exposed. There were slaves of every nationality, and on this depended in general the names by which they were called and the work which was assigned them. The <seg lang="la">familia</seg> (a designation including all the slaves, or <seg lang="la">famuli</seg>, belonging to the same master) was generally divided into that of the country (<seg lang="la">familia rustica</seg>) and that of the town (<seg lang="la">familia urbana</seg>). <cb /></p>
 <p>The work done by the slaves was of the most varied character, and the great diversity of their occupations is partly explained by the fact that almost every kind of work required a special slave, and it was considered not consistent with good breeding, and a sign of poverty, if the same slave was intrusted with several different duties. Thus there were in the country special slaves for the various branches of agriculture, horticulture, and the tending of cattle, the cultivation of olives and vines, the keeping of bees and of poultry, and for the preserves and fishponds. These slaves were under the supervision of the <seg lang="la">vilicus</seg> (farm-bailiff) or <seg lang="la">actor</seg> (steward), who had to render the accounts to the master or his representative.</p>
 <p>The number of town-slaves was not due to actual requirements, but depended upon the luxurious fashions which became more and more prevalent in the last two centuries of the Republic. In older times the house and everything belonging to it was in charge of the <seg lang="la">aedituus</seg> (“major domo,” “steward”), who managed all household affairs, received and spent money, negotiated sales and purchases, and disposed of the stores. When the extension of the household made it necessary to keep a special person to control the expenditure, the steward's functions were limited to seeing that the house and furniture were properly cleaned and in a good state. Besides him there were subordinate servants for the various dwellings, the spare rooms for visitors, the shrine of the household gods, the images of the ancestors, the various kinds of furniture, the art collections, and the wardrobe; and there was also a porter (<seg lang="la">ianitor</seg> or <seg lang="la">ostiarius</seg>), who, according to an old custom, was chained like a dog ( <title>De Rhet.</title> 3; Columel. 1 pr. 10; Ovid, <title>Amores</title>, i. 6, 1).</p>
 <p>The kitchen was in charge of a special slave, an even more expensive one than the <seg lang="la">vilicus;</seg> and under him were a host of assistants, wood-carriers, market-men, pastry-cooks, etc. The service at table also necessitated a numerous attendance of dressers, servers, carvers, fore-tasters, cup-bearers, table-clearers and others, who similarly were under a special foreman, the <seg lang="la">tricliniarcha</seg>, who saw to the general arrangements and to the lighting. The master and mistress of the house were served by special valets (<seg lang="la">cubicularii</seg>), who also had to announce visitors (<seg lang="la">nomenclatores</seg>), and pages and chambermaids and special servants for the bath and the toilet. It was considered of especial importance that, when the master or mistress of the house left it on foot or in a litter, the slaves following them should be numerous and richly attired. Some slaves went before their master (<seg lang="la">anteambulones</seg>), especially the <seg lang="la">nomenclator</seg>, who informed his master of the names of the persons they met; others followed (<seg lang="la">pedisequi</seg>); others, again, were told off for attending their master with torches and lanterns on leaving parties in the evening. The litter of each member of the family was carried by from six to eight <seg lang="la">lecticarii</seg>, particularly strong men, and by preference Cappadocians. For travelling across country there was always a large escort, consisting of crowds of equerries, outriders, grooms, etc. The most important position among the servants was occupied by those whom the master himself chose to assist him in his business or his recreations, as, for instance, those who attended to money matters and to the supervision of the slaves, secretaries, physicians, readers at 
<pb n="1455" /><cb />
 meals or during the bath or before going to sleep, literary men (<seg lang="la">litterati</seg>), librarians, and transcribers of books. For other kinds of recreation there were also slaves who had received a musical training, <seg lang="la">pantomimi</seg>, fools, and jesters. See <ref type="cross" target="crossnani">Nanus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The various classes of slaves had each its special foreman, with a substitute whom he either received from his master or bought with his savings (<seg lang="la">peculium</seg>). These formed the class of the <seg lang="la">ordinarii</seg>, who enjoyed the special confidence of their master; this class included such servants as looked after the food, clothing, and medical attendance of the slaves, the maintenance and watching of the various buildings, the accounts of the household (<seg lang="la">cellarius</seg>), and the expenses of the master (<seg lang="la">dispensator</seg>). Young slaves were trained for the various requirements of the household; according to their abilities, they were taught some trade or art, or had practice given them either in keeping accounts or in learned studies. Under the Empire, those who were destined to be pages received their education in special <seg lang="la">paedagogia</seg> or establishments, kept not only by the emperor, but also by private citizens. As in Greece, trained slaves were established in some trade by themselves, or let out on hire; such was the case even with slaves who were artists or men of learning. Even posts of independence, such as the administration of an estate in the country, or of a bank, or the command of a ship, were intrusted to slaves, who received a share in the profits, or paid interest on the capital invested, or a fixed sum of money when the capital was their own. For the slaves were allowed to acquire a private fortune (<seg lang="la">peculium</seg>) from what they saved on their allowances and from the regular profits of their service. The masters regarded this arrangement with favour, especially as it represented a kind of caution money in case any damage was done. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspeculium">Peculium</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Roman slave was, in the eyes of the law, a mere chattel (Varro even styles him “a speaking tool” [<seg lang="la">instrumentum vocale</seg>]), and hence absolutely without any rights and completely exposed to the caprice of his master. The latter could compel him to do the meanest and most shameful things, could torture or kill him, or cast him out when he was old or weakly; and as this treatment was legally permitted, it was carried out in practice when occasion offered. Especial cruelty was experienced by the country-slaves, who worked in chains in the greater part of Italy, and were kept in a guarded work-house (<seg lang="la">ergastulum</seg>) at night; some of them were branded, or had half of their heads shaven. It was therefore a severe punishment for a town-slave to be sent into the country.</p>
 <p>When the slaves were less numerous and were restricted to the drudgery of farm life, and when the consul himself had but one or two personal attendants, their treatment was, as has been said, the treatment accorded to animals. “Let the slave sleep or work,” says Cato in his terse book of rules, implying that his working hours must all be devoted to toil. “Speak to slaves in monosyllables,” says another writer (Seneca). “Treat them like wild beasts and subdue them by lashing. You will have as many enemies as you have slaves.” And throughout the whole period of Roman history, the mere labourers fared as might have been expected among a people who followed out these harsh measures. A slave's life was long a matter of no concern to the State. It belonged <cb /> wholly to his master. The elder Cato used not infrequently to put one of his slaves to death in the presence of his fellows to cow them into absolute subservience. There was no feeling of humanity visible in the treatment accorded to them. Pollio, the friend of Augustus, used a slave to feed the eels in his artificial lake. Augustus himself crucified a slave for killing a favourite quail. For worse offences worse punishments were devised. Men were lashed to death, crushed between two millstones; had their hands, feet, nose, lips, and eyes cut out and were then flung upon the bare ground to die; or they were suspended by hooks of iron to be devoured by the birds of prey. If a slave killed his master, not only he but all his companions were tortured and put to death; yet the killing of masters was not infrequent. Pliny in one of his letters gives one instance (iii. 14): “Largius Macedo, a man of praetorian rank, has suffered a dreadful fate at the hands of his slaves; a harsh master he was, too. While he was taking a bath at his Formian villa his slaves of a sudden surrounded him. One seized him by the throat, another struck him in the face; another bruised his breast and stomach, and when they thought him dead flung him on the heated marble to see whether he still lived.” So Tacitus ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 14. 42" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 42</bibl>) describes the murder of the city praefect, Pedianus Secundus, by his slaves, on which occasion four hundred innocent slaves were put to death with the guilty. Often the slaves, driven to desperation by their masters, banded together in a frantic struggle for vengeance. On one occasion several hundred broke out into the city, and rushing through the streets slew without discrimination every one they met, until they were themselves cut to pieces by a detachment of the Guards.</p>
 <p>It was not until the influence of Christianity began to be felt that the Roman conception of humanity became sufficiently enlarged to embrace the slave as well as the freeman. Gradually the way to emancipation was made more and more easy. Gradually, too, the law began to throw some safeguards around the person of the slave, forbidding excessive cruelty on the master's part. At last, under Justinian, any slave could gain his freedom by becoming a monk or “spiritual person” ( <bibl n="Just. Nov. 5. 2" default="NO"> <title>Nov.</title>v. 2</bibl><bibl n="Just. Nov. 1" default="NO"> Nov., 1</bibl>; cxxiii. 7<bibl n="Just. Nov. 35" default="NO"> Nov., 35</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The usual mode of killing slaves was crucifixion (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscrux">Crux</ref>), which was put down by the Christian emperors. If a slave dared to wreak vengeance on his master, every slave who was under the same roof at the time was put to death with him. This cruelty of treatment, which grew continually in the last centuries of the Republic, brought on repeated and terrible insurrections of the slaves. Under the Empire they received some legal protection; in its very beginning, the master's right to condemn his slaves to fight with wild beasts was taken away from him and transferred to a regular judge—the praefect of the city at Rome and the procurator in the provinces. These officials were also empowered by Antoninus Pius to receive the complaints of slaves about cruel treatment, and to sell the slaves to another master, in case their complaints were found to rest on truth. Hadrian deprived the owners of the right of killing and torturing slaves at their pleasure, or of selling them to keepers of gladiatorial schools or to procurers; and, finally, Constantine placed the intentional killing of a slave on a level with murder. 
<pb n="1456" /><cb /> A kind of married relation between slaves, called <seg lang="la">contubernium</seg>, was permitted at an early time. Under the Empire, it became a rule to regard it as lasting and indissoluble, and even to celebrate the marriage of slaves by wedding festivities. Having no legal rights, the slave could not give evidence in a law court, and, as in Greece, only what he said when under torture was deemed worthy of credit. The Roman, like the Athenian, government had public slaves (<seg lang="la">servi publici</seg>), who, on the whole, had the same legal position as the private slaves. They lived in public buildings assigned to them by the censors, and received from the public chest a yearly sum to pay for their board (<seg lang="la">cibaria</seg>). They were partly employed as custodians of temples and public buildings (<seg lang="la">aeditui</seg>), partly as servants to the various priesthoods and to those magistrates who had duties relating to the police—namely, the censors and aediles who under Augustus had under their control a body of 600 <seg lang="la">servi publici</seg> for the prevention of fires (see <ref type="cross" target="crossvigiles">Vigiles</ref>), the overseers of the water supply and of the prisons, and those who had to see capital offences carried out. The slaves of the latter included the hangman (<hi rend="italic">carnifex</hi>), who was intrusted with the special duty of executing slaves, and who had to live outside the Esquiline Gate.</p>
 <p>There was no distinctive dress for Roman slaves. It was once proposed in the Senate to give them a distinctive costume, but it was rejected since it was considered dangerous to show them how numerous they were ( <title>De Clem.</title> i. 24). Male slaves were not allowed to wear the toga or bulla, nor females the stola; but otherwise they were dressed in nearly the same way as the poorer people, in tunics and cloaks of a dark colour (<seg lang="la">pullati</seg>) and slippers (<seg lang="la">crepidae</seg>), or in the country <seg lang="la">sculponeae</seg> or clogs (<seg lang="la">vestis servilis</seg>, <title>In Pis.</title> 38, 93).</p>
 <p>The prices of ordinary slaves was low by reason of the great number of them on sale at Rome. The struggles of Rome with Pyrrhus, with Perseus, with Hannibal, with the Sicilians, with the Gauls, the Cimbri, and the Germans, all ending in the success of the Roman arms, turned the metropolis into a great slave-market whither the prisoners fresh from the field of battle, and representing every country, civilized and barbarian, poured in one continuous throng. Scipio Aemilianus is said to have sold nearly 60,000 Carthaginians into slavery. Marius made serfs of 140,000 Cimbri. Aemilius Paullus handed over 150,000 men, women, and children to the military quaestors who accompanied his army, and who acted as the fiscal agents of the government. Cicero received a sum of money equivalent to $500,000 from the sale of his prisoners of war. Gracchus is said to have enslaved so many Sardinians that the very name Sardus became a synonym for “slave.” Popilius Laenas carried off 20,000 Statielli (Liguria) at once. Pompey and Caesar are roughly estimated to have sold at various times a million of human beings into slavery. The whole world was laid under contribution to supply the market for human chattels. “Long lines of chained prisoners from Germany, Gaul, and even Britain,” says Duruy, “were led to Rome. Utica and Egypt furnished blacks; Numidia, swift runners; Alexandria, grammarians; Sidoné and Cyprus, those intelligent, docile, and corrupt Asiatics so highly prized as house servants; Greece, her handsome boys and girls; Epirus and Illyria, the most experienced shepherds; Germany, <cb /> Gaul, and Thrace, the most savage gladiators; Cappadocia, the most patient labourers. Slave-dealers (<seg lang="la">mangones</seg>) accompanied every army, and the clash of arms had hardly ceased when the battle-field resounded with the sharp cries and sordid bustle of an auction-room.”</p>
 <p>How cheaply these newly-made slaves were rated is seen from the fact that Lucullus once sold a large number of prisoners at an average price of four drachmae—eighty cents—apiece. At Rome, the slave-market, as already stated, was under the supervision of the aediles; and the sales were usually at public auction, though slaves of great beauty or remarkable accomplishments were sometimes reserved for private sale, as we learn from Martial (ix. 60). The chief points of inquiry regarding an ordinary male slave were as to whether he was given to thievery, subject to epilepsy, of a suicidal tendency, and whether he had ever tried to escape. The slaves when on exhibition were often obliged to strip naked, and to jump, run, and move about to show their paces for the information of the intending purchasers. Medical experts were sometimes called in to give their opinion of the soundness of the slave.</p>
 <p>In certain cases the law allowed a free person to be sold as a slave—e. g. those who attempted to evade public burdens by not having their names entered on the census (<seg lang="la">incensi</seg>), or who shirked military service, and the insolvent debtor under the old law of execution by <seg lang="la">manus iniectio.</seg> According to the old law, a thief caught in the act (<seg lang="la">fur manifestus</seg>) was adjudged (<seg lang="la">addictus</seg>) to the person whose property he had stolen. A free man over twenty years of age who collusively allowed himself to be sold as a slave in order to secretly share the purchase-money with the vendor was as early as the time of Mucius Scaevola refused his <seg lang="la">proclamatio in libertatem</seg> by the praetor, and so in effect adjudged a siave. By an enactment of Claudius also ( <title>Claud.</title> 25), a freedman who had misconducted himself towards his patron might be again enslaved. Under the emperors it was established that a free man who was condemned to death, to penal servitude in the mines, or to fight with gladiators or wild beasts, became and died a slave.</p>
 <p>The prices at which slaves sold at Rome varied, of course, very much with the time, the characteristics of the slave, and the requirements of the purchaser. In the time of Horace, an ordinary male slave cost about $90; somewhat later, $125. This was the price of a day labourer. More valuable were those who possessed some special accomplishment, who had a knowledge of medicine, or who were literary men.</p>
 <p>Thus M. Scaurus bought a grammarian named Natius for 700,000 sesterces, or $28,000; boys sold for 100,000 sesterces ($4000) to 200,000 sesterces ($8000). A fool (<seg lang="la">morio</seg>) brought an average of 20,000 sesterces ($800) ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 13</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Good-looking girls were sold for immoral purposes for an average price of $1000; but if they were known to have already lost their virtue $25 was considered a fair price. Of all slaves, negroes and eunuchs were the most costly, the latter being largely sold for immoral purposes; so that Pliny records that Seianus, the minister of Tiberius, sold a eunuch named Paezon to Lutorius for the extraordinary sum of 50,000,000 sesterces, or $2,000,000. In later times some attempt was made to pass a sumptuary law regulating the prices of slaves. 
<pb n="1457" /><cb /> Justinian fixed a regular tariff, eunuchs running from $150 to $350.</p>
 <p>It is obvious that between the ordinary slave and his master there existed no ties of affection, and no feelings of gratitude that could lead to closer intimacy. This, however, was not true of the class of slaves who were sold as house-slaves, as personal attendants, as <seg lang="la">paedagogi</seg>, actors, teachers, and artists. These, coming often from the most polished communities of Greece, or often from the luxurious cities of Asia Minor, were infinitely the superiors of the Romans in intellectual training and accomplishments; and they could not fail to make themselves influential, and if not respected, at least felt. We can scarcely conceive of the ascendency which they attained at Rome. Everything was in their hands. They managed the estates, they kept the accounts, they arranged their masters' pleasures and kept them amused; they wrote their books, they painted their pictures, they controlled their fashions, they taught them music—and, more potent than all, they reared and trained their children. They swarmed in every household, and being keen-witted, intelligent, pliable, plausible, utterly shameless, and morally corrupt, they became a great plague spot in the heart of a community that had once been self-respecting, pure-minded, and devout. It is quite impossible to conceive of anything more demoralizing than such an influence, so widely exerted and so powerful for evil. It is not surprising to find a single century converting the Romans into a semi-Asiatic people living like Eastern voluptuaries, their houses glittering with gold and silver and jewels; their tables loaded with luxuries and crowded with sycophants; their halls swarming with human beings who won favour only by pandering to the most revolting vice and by stimulating jaded desire; their lives given over to gluttony and lust; their old ambition, their once strong intellects, their national pride, and their personal honour all flung away and turned to rottenness by the taint of that system which degrades and blights its victim by forcing him to be the unwilling instrument for the ruin of his fellow-men.</p>

</figure> He returned to Egypt after an absence of nine years, and the countless captives whom he brought back with him were employed in the erection of numerous public works, such as those of which ruins still exist at Karnak, Luxor, AbuSimbel, Memphis, and Thebes. Memorials of Ramses-Sesostris still exist throughout the whole of Egypt, from the mouth of the Nile to the south of Nubia, as also in the rock-tablets at Beyrut. An epic poem of one Pentaur, found on the monuments, celebrates his victories over the Kheta (i. e. Hittites). By some he has been identified with the Pharaoh of Exodus, but Lepsius thinks that the accounts of him confuse reminiscences of Sethos I. and Rameses II.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σεθών</foreign>). A priest of Hephaestus (Ptah), who made himself master of Egypt after the expulsion of Sabacon, king of the Ethiopians, and was succeeded by the Dodecarchia, or government of the twelve chiefs, which ended in the sole sovereignty of Psammetichus. Herodotus relates (ii. 141) that in Sethon's reign Sanacharibus, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, advanced against Egypt, at which Sethon was in great alarm, as he had insulted the warrior class, and deprived them of their lands, and they now refused to follow him to the war. But the god Hephaestus came to his assistance; for while the two armies were encamped near Pelusium, the field-mice in the night gnawed to pieces the bow-strings, the quivers, and the shield-handles of the Assyrians, who fled on the following day with great loss. The recollection of this miracle was perpetuated by a statue of the king in the temple of Hephaestus, holding a mouse in his hand, and saying, “Let every one look at me and be pious.” This Sanacharibus is the Sennacherib of the Scriptures, and the destruction of the Assyrians at Pelusium is evidently only another version of the miraculous destruction of the Assyrians by the angel of the Lord, when they had advanced against Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah. According to the Jewish records, this event happened in B.C. 711.

 <head>The <term>Seven against Thebes</term></head>
 <p>Oedipus, king of Thebes, had pronounced a curse upon his sons Eteocles and Polynices that they should die at one another's hand. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossoedipus">Oedipus</ref>.) In order to make the fulfilment of the curse impossible by separating himself from his brother, Polynices left Thebes while his father was still alive, and at Argos married Argea, the daughter of <ref type="cross" target="crossadrastus">Adrastus</ref> (q.v.). On the death of his father he was recalled, and given by Eteocles, who was the elder of the two (Eurip. <bibl n="Sen. Phoen. 71" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phoen.</title>71</bibl>), the choice between the kingdom and the treasures of Oedipus; but, on account of a quarrel that arose over the division, he departed a second time, and induced his father-in-law to undertake a war against his native city. According to another legend, the brothers deprived their father of the kingdom, and agreed to rule alternately, and to quit the city for a year at a time. Polynices, as the younger, first went into voluntary banishment; but when, after the expiration of a year, Eteocles denied him his right, and drove him out by violence, he fled to Argos, where Adrastus made him his son-in-law, and undertook to restore him with an armed force. Adrastus was the leader of the army; besides Polynices and Tydeus of Calydon, the other son-in-law of the king, there also took part in the expedition the king's brothers Hippomedon and <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenopaeus">Parthenopaeus</ref> (q.v.), Capaneus, a descendant of Proetus, and <ref type="cross" target="crossamphiaraus">Amphiaraüs</ref> (q.v.), the latter against his will, and foreseeing his own death. The Atridae were invited to join in the expedition, but were withheld by evil omens from Zeus.</p>
 <p>When the Seven reached Nemea on their march, a fresh warning befell them. Hypsipylé, the nurse of Opheltes, the son of King Lycurgus, laid her charge down on the grass in order to lead the thirsty warriors to a spring; during her absence the child was killed by a snake. They gave him solemn burial, and instituted the Nemean Games in his honour; but Amphiaraüs interpreted the occurrence as an omen of his own fate, and accordingly gave the boy the name of Archemorus (i. e. “leader to death”). When they arrived at the river Asopus in Boeotia, they sent <ref type="cross" target="crosstydeus">Tydeus</ref> (q.v.) to Thebes in the hope of coming to terms. He was refused a hearing, and the Thebans laid an ambush for him on his return. The Seven now advanced to the walls of the city, and posted themselves with their troops one at each of its seven gates. Against them were posted seven chosen Thebans, among them Melanippus and Periclymenus. <ref type="cross" target="crossmenoeceus">Menoeceus</ref> (q.v.) devoted himself to death to insure the victory for the Thebans. In the battle at the sanctuary of the Ismenian Apollo they were driven right back to their gates; the giant Capaneus had already climbed the wall by a scaling-ladder, and was presumptuously boasting that even the lightning of Zeus should not drive him back, when the flaming bolt of the god smote him down, and dashed him to atoms. The beautiful Parthenopaeus also fell, with his skull shattered by a rock that was hurled 
<pb n="1459" /><cb />
 at him. Adrastus desisted from the assault, and the armies, which had suffered severely, agreed that the originators of the quarrel, Eteocles and Polynices, should fight out their difference in single combat. Both brothers fell, and a fresh battle arose over their bodies. In this all of the assailants met their death, except Adrastus, who was saved by the speed of his black-maned charger. According to the older legends, his eloquence persuaded the Thebans to give the fallen due burial. When the bodies of the hostile brothers were placed on the pyre, the flames, which were meant to destroy them together, parted into two portions. According to the version of the story invented by the Attic tragedians, the Thebans refused to bury their foes, but at the prayer of Adrastus were compelled to do so by Theseus; according to another version, he conquered the Thebans and buried the dead bodies at Eleusis in Attica. For the burial of Polynices, see <ref type="cross" target="crossantigone">Antigoné;</ref> and also <ref type="cross" target="crossepigoni">Epigoni</ref>. The story forms the subject of one of the extant plays of Aeschylus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaeschylus">Aeschylus</ref>.

 <p>Seven Christians of Ephesus who, according to the story related by Gregory of Tours (<title>Mirac.

Returning to the city, they experienced the surprise that Rip Van Winkle felt on his famous return, and at last discovered the truth regarding their sleep. Having had an interview with the emperor and convinced him of the life beyond the grave, they sank into a second sleep that is to last until the Resurrection. Their names as usually given are Maximianus, Malchus, Martinianus, Dionysius, Johannes, Serapion, and Constantius. Gregory states that the story is of Syrian origin.

He was a man of low origin and dissolute character, but was much feared for the severity of his attacks upon the Roman nobles. He must have commenced his career as a public slanderer very early, if he is the person against whom the sixth Epode of Horace is directed, as is supposed by many ancient and modern commentators. Towards the latter end of the reign of Augustus, Severus was banished by Augustus to the island of Crete on account of his libellous verses; but as he still continued to write libels, he was removed by Tiberius in A.D. 24 to the desert island of Seriphus, where he died in great poverty in the twenty-fifth year of his exile, A.D. 33.

 <p>A Roman emperor (A.D. 193-211), who was born 146, near Leptis in Africa. After holding various important military commands under M. Aurelius and Commodus, he was at length appointed commander-in-chief of the army in Pannonia and Illyria. By this army he was proclaimed emperor after the death of Pertinax (193). He forthwith marched upon Rome, where Iulianus had been made emperor by the Praetorian troops. Iulianus was put to death upon his arrival before the city. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossiulianus">Iulianus</ref>.) Severus then turned his arms against Pescennius Niger, who had been saluted emperor by the Eastern legions. The struggle was brought to a close by a decisive battle near Issus, in which Niger was defeated by Severus, and, having been shortly afterwards taken prisoner, was put to death by order of the latter (194). Severus then laid siege to Byzantium, which refused to submit to him even after the death of Niger, and which was not taken till 196. The city was treated with great severity by Severus. Its walls were levelled with the earth, its soldiers and magistrates put to death, and the town itself, deprived of all its political 
<pb n="1460" /><cb />
 privileges, made over to the Perinthians. During the continuance of this siege, Severus had crossed the Euphrates (195) and subdued the Mesopotamian Arabians. He returned to Italy in 196, and in the same year proceeded to Gaul to oppose Albinus, who had been proclaimed emperor by the troops in that country. Albinus was defeated and slain in a terrible battle fought near Lyons on the 19th of February, 197. Severus returned to Rome in the same year; but after remaining a short time in the capital, he set out for the East in order to repel the invasion of the Parthians, who were ravaging Mesopotamia. He crossed the Euphrates early in 198, and commenced a series of operations which were attended with brilliant results. Seleucia and Babylon were evacuated by the enemy, and Ctesiphon was taken and plundered after a short siege. After spending three years in the East, and visiting Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt, Severus returned to Rome in 202. For the next seven years he remained tranquilly at Rome, but in 208 he went to Britain with his sons Caracalla and Geta. Here he carried on war against the <figure id="fig.01460">

</figure> Alexander in consequence, as was asserted, of a direct revelation on the part of the Syrian god. On the death of Elagabalus, on the 11th of March, A.D. 222, Alexander ascended the throne, adding Severus to his other designations, in order to mark more explicitly the descent which he claimed from the father of Caracalla. After reigning in peace some years, during which he reformed many abuses in the State, he was involved in a war with Artaxerxes, king of Persia, who had lately founded the new Empire of the Sassanidae on the ruins of the Parthian monarchy. Alexander gained a great victory over Artaxerxes in 232; but he was unable to prosecute his advantage in consequence of intelligence having reached him of a great movement among the German tribes. He celebrated a triumph at Rome in 233, and in the following year (234) set out for Gaul, which the Germans were devastating; but before he had made any progress in the campaign, he was waylaid by a small band of mutinous soldiers, instigated, it is said, by Maximinus, and slain, along with his mother, in the early part of 235, in the thirtieth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign. Alexander Severus was distinguished by justice, wisdom, and clemency in all public transactions, and by the simplicity and purity of his private life. His life is written by Lampridius.

They were described sometimes as priestesses of Apollo, sometimes as his favourite wives or daughters. We have no certain information as to their number, names, country, or date. Though Plato (<title>Phaedr.</title> 294 B) knew of only one, others mention two, three, four (the Erythraean, the Samian, the Egyptian, and the Sardian), and even ten or twelve: the Babylonian, the Libyan, the (elder and younger) Delphian, the Cimmerian, the (elder and younger) Erythraean, the Samian, the Cumaean, the Hellespontine, the Phrygian, and the Tiburtine.</p>
 <p>In the earliest times they are mentioned as dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Trojan Ida in Asia Minor, later at Erythrae in Ionia, in Samos, at Delphi, and at Cumae in Italy. The most famous was the Erythraean Sibyl, Herophilé, who is usually considered identical with the Cumaean, as she is represented as journeying by manifold wanderings from her home to Cumae. Here she is said to have lived for many generations in the crypts beneath the temple of Apollo, where she had even prophesied to Aeneas. In later times the designation of Sibyl was also given to the prophetic nymph Albunea near Tibur (Lactant. i. 6, 12).</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sibylline Books</hi>, so often met with in Roman history, had their origin in a collection of oracular utterances in Greek hexameters, composed in the time of Solon and Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida, and ascribed to the Hellespontic Sibyl, buried in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. This collection was brought by way of Erythrae to Cumae, and finally, in the time of the last king, to Rome. According to the legend, the Cumaean Sibyl offered to Tarquinius Superbus nine books of prophecies; and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned all but three of them, which the king purchased for the original price, and had them preserved in a vault beneath the Capitoline temple of Iupiter (Varro, <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Lactant. <title>Inst. Div.</title> i. 6; <bibl n="Dionys.  4. 62" default="NO">Dionys.iv. 62</bibl>;  <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 8. 815" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>viii. 815</bibl>). When they were destroyed in the burning of the Capitol in B.C. 83, the Senate sent envoys to make a collection of similar oracular sayings distributed over various places, in particular Ilium, Erythrae, and Samos. This new collection was deposited in the restored temple, together with similar sayings of native origin— e. g. those of the Sibyl at Tibur, of the brothers Marcius , and others. From the Capitol they were transferred by Augustus as pontifex, in B.C. 12, to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, after they had been examined and copied; here they remained until about A.D. 405. They are said to have been burned by Stilicho. The use of these oracles was from the outset reserved for the State, and they were not consulted for the foretelling of future 
<pb n="1462" /><cb />
 events, but on the occasion of remarkable calamities, such as pestilence, earthquake, and as a means of expiating portents. It was only the rites of expiation prescribed by the Sibylline Books that were communicated to the public, and not the oracles themselves. As these books recognized the gods worshipped and the rites observed in the neighbourhood of Troy, they were the principal cause of the introduction of a series of foreign deities and religious rites into the Roman State worship, of the amalgamation of national deities with the corresponding deities of Greece, and a general modification of the Roman religion after the Greek type.</p>
 <p>Tarquinius is said to have intrusted the care of the books to a special <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> of two men of patrician rank. After B.C. 367 their number was increased to ten, half patrician and half plebeian; and in the first century B.C., probably in the time of Sulla , five more were added. These officials were entitled respectively <seg lang="la">duumviri, decemviri</seg>, and <seg lang="la">quindecimviri sacris faciundis.</seg> They were usually ex-consuls or ex-praetors. They held office for life, and were exempt from all other public duties. They had the responsibility of keeping the books in safety and secrecy, of consulting them at the order of the Senate, of interpreting the utterances they found therein, and of causing the measures thus enjoined to be carried out; in particular they had the superintendence of the worship of Apollo, the Magna Mater, and Ceres, which had been introduced by the Sibylline Books. See Marquardt, iii. 358 foll.; and Bouché-Leclercq, <title>Hist. de la Divination</title>, ii. pp. 133 foll.</p>
 <p>These Sibylline Books have no connection with a collection of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sibylline Oracles</hi> in twelve books, written in Greek hexameters, which have come down to us. The latter contain a medley of pretended prophecies by various authors and of very various dates, from the middle of the second century B.C. to the fifth century A.D. They were composed partly by Alexandrian Jews, partly by Christians, in the interests of their respective religions; and in part they refer to events of the later Empire. They are edited by Alexandre <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1841-56)</bibl>; Friedlieb <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1852)</bibl>; Rzach <bibl default="NO">(Vienna, 1891)</bibl>; and Diels <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1891)</bibl>.

<head orig="Sicilia">Sicilia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σικελία</foreign>). Sicily; a large island in the Mediterranean Sea, off the southern coast of Italy. It was anciently identified with the Thrinacia (<foreign lang="greek">Θρινακία</foreign>) of Homer, and is styled <ref type="cross" target="crosstrinacria">Trinacria</ref> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Trinācris</hi>, names supposed to mean “three-cornered,” whence the Romans likewise styled the island <hi rend="SmallCaps">Triquetra</hi> (cf. <bibl n="Lucr. 1.717" default="NO" valid="yes">Lucret. i. 717</bibl>). The names Sicilia and Sicania come from that of its early inhabitants—the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sicĕli</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crosssicani">Sicāni</ref>. It is separated from Italy by the narrow channel called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fretum Sicŭlum</hi> or simply <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fretum</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Πορθμός</foreign>), also <hi rend="SmallCaps">Scyllaeum Fretum</hi>, now the Strait of Messina. The part of the Mediterranean lying to the east and south of the island was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Maré Sicŭlum</hi>. Sicily is in the shape of a triangle, the north and south sides of which are about 175 miles long exclusive of the windings of the coast; the eastern side has a length of 115 miles. The northwestern point was the Promontorium Lilybaeum; the northeastern point, Promontorium Pelorus, and the southeastern point, Promontorium Pachynus. Sicily was originally a part of Italy, and was torn from it by some great convulsion of nature. A mountain range (Nebrodi Montes) extends through it as a continuation of the Apennines. Of this range the most important offshoots are Mount Aetna on the east of the island, Mount Eryx (S. Giuliano) on the west, and the Heraei Montes (Monti Sori) in the south. A number of small rivers have their sources in the mountains, but most of them are dry, or nearly so, in the summer. The soil of Sicily was very fertile, and produced in antiquity an immense quantity of wheat, on which the population of Rome relied to a great extent for their subsistence. So celebrated was it even in early times on account of its corn that it was represented as sacred to Demeter, and as the favourite abode of this goddess. Hence it was in this island that her daughter Persephoné was carried away by Pluto. Besides corn, the island produced excellent wine, saffron, honey, almonds, and the other Southern fruits.</p>
 <p>The earliest inhabitants of Sicily are said to have been the savage Cyclopes and Laestrygones; but these are fabulous beings, and the first inhabitants mentioned in history are the Sicani (<foreign lang="greek">Σικανοί</foreign>) or Siculi (<foreign lang="greek">Σικελοί</foreign>), who crossed over into the island from Italy. Some writers, indeed, regard the Sicani and Siculi as two distinct tribes, supposing the latter only to have migrated from Italy, and the former to have been the aboriginal inhabitants of the country; but there is no good reason for making any distinction between them. They appear to have been a Keltic people. According to Thucydides, their original settlement was on the river Sicanus in Iberia; but as Thucydides extends Iberia as far as the Rhône, it is probable that Sicanus was a river of Gaul, and it may have been the Sequana, as some modern writers suppose. The ancient writers relate that these Sicani, being hard pressed by the Ligyes (Ligures), crossed the Alps and settled in Latium; that, being driven out of this country by the Aborigines with the help of Pelasgians, they migrated to the south of the peninsnla, where they lived for a considerable time along with the Oenotrians, but finally crossed over into Sicily, to which they gave their name. They soon spread over the greater part of the island, but in later times were found chiefly in the interior and in the northern part; some of the most important 
<pb n="1463" /><cb /> towns belonging to them were Herbita, Agyrium, Adranum, and Enna. The next immigrants into the island were Cretans, who are said to have come to Sicily under their king, Minos, in pursuit of Daedalus, and to have settled on the southern coast in the neighbourhood of Agrigentum, where they founded Minoa (afterwards Heraclea Minoa). Then came the Elymaei, a small band of fugitive Trojans, who are said to have built Entella, Eryx, and Egesta. These Cretans and Elymaei, however, if indeed they ever visited Sicily, soon became incorporated with the Siculi. The Phoenicians likewise at an early period formed settlements, for the purposes of commerce, on all the coasts of Sicily, but more especially on the northern and northwestern parts. They were subsequently obliged to retire from the greater part of their settlements before the increasing power of the Greeks, and to <figure id="fig.01463">
<head orig="Siceliote Coin. (Third century B.C.)">Siceliote Coin. (Third century B.C.)</head>
</figure> confine themselves to Motya, Solūs, and Panormus. But the most important of all the immigrants into Sicily were the Greeks. The first body of Greeks who landed in the island were Chalcidians from Euboea, and Megarians led by the Athenian Thucles. These Greek colonists built the town of Naxos, B.C. 735. They were soon followed by other Greeks, who founded a number of very flourishing cities, such as Syracuse in 734, Leontini and Catana in 730, Megara Hybla in 726, Gela in 690, Selinus in 626, Agrigentum in 579, etc. The Greeks soon became the ruling race in the island, and received the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Siceliōtae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Σικελιώται</foreign>) to distinguish them from the earlier inhabitants.</p>
 <p>At a later time the Carthaginians obtained a firm footing in Sicily. Their first attempt was made in 480; but they were defeated by Gelon of Syracuse, and obliged to retire with great loss. Their second invasion in 409 was more successful. They took Selinus in this year, and four years afterwards (405) the powerful city of Agrigentum. They now became the permanent masters of the western part of the island, and were engaged in frequent wars with Syracuse and the other Greek cities. (For the Athenian invasion of Sicily, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssyracusae">Syracusae</ref>.) The struggle between the Carthaginians and Greeks continued, with a few interruptions, down to the First Punic War; at the close of which (241) the Carthaginians were obliged to evacuate the island, the western part of which now passed into the hands of the Romans, and was made a Roman province. The eastern part still continued under the rule of Hieron of Syracuse as an ally of Rome; but after the revolt of Syracuse in the Second Punic War, and the conquest of that city by Marcellus, the whole island was made a Roman province, and was administered by a praetor. Under the Roman dominion more attention was paid to agriculture than to commerce; and consequently the Greek cities on the coast gradually declined in prosperity and wealth. The inhabitants of the province received the <seg lang="la">ius Latii</seg> <cb /> from Iulius Caesar; and Antony conferred upon them, in accordance, as it was said, with Caesar's will, the full Roman franchise. Augustus, after his conquest of Sextus Pompey, who had held the island for several years, founded colonies at Messana, Tauromenium, Catana, Syracuse, Thermae, and Panormus. On the downfall of the Roman Empire, Sicily formed part of the kingdom of the Ostrogoths; but it was taken from them by Belisarius in A.D. 536, and annexed to the Byzantine Empire. It continued a province of this Empire till 828, when it was conquered by the Saracens.</p>
 <p>Literature and the arts were cultivated with great success in the Greek cities of Sicily, especially at the time of the first <ref type="cross" target="crosshiero">Hiero</ref> (q.v.) of Syracuse (B.C. 478-467), and of Dionysius the elder, the friend of Plato. Sicily was the birthplace of the philosophers Empedocles, Epicharmus, and Dicaearchus; of the mathematician Archimedes; of the physicians Herodicus and Acron; of the historians Diodorus, Antiochus, Philistus, and Timaeus; of the rhetorician Gorgias; and of the poets Stesichorus, Theocritus, and Moschus.</p>

<head orig="Sicyonia">Sicyonia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σικυωνία</foreign>). A small district in the northeast of the Peloponnesus, whose area was probably somewhat less than one hundred square miles. It consisted of a plain near the sea with mountains in the interior. Its rivers, which ran in a northeasterly direction, were Sythas on the frontier of Achaia, Helisson, Selleïs, and Asopus in the interior, and Nemea on the frontier of the territory of Corinth. The land was fertile, and produced excellent oil. Its almonds and its fish were also much prized.</p>
 <p>Its chief town was <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sicyon</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Σικυών</foreign>, “cucumbertown”), which was situated a little to the west of the river Asopus. The ancient city, which was situated in the plain, was destroyed by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and a new city, which bore for a short time the name of Demetrius, was built by him on the high ground close to the Acropolis. The harbour, which, according to some, was connected with the city by means of long walls, was well fortified, and formed a town of itself. Sicyon was one of the most ancient cities of Greece. It is said to have been originally called <ref type="cross" target="crossaegialea">Aegialēa</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aegiăli</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰγιάλεια, Αἰγιαλοί</foreign>), after an ancient king, Aegialeus; to have been subsequently named <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mecōné</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Μηκώνη</foreign>, “poppy-town”), and to have been finally called Sicyon from an Athenian of that name. Sicyon is represented by Homer as forming part of the empire of Agamemnon; but on the invasion of Peloponnesus it became subject to Phalces, the son of Temenus, and was henceforward a Dorian State. The ancient inhabitants, however, were formed into a fourth tribe called Aegialeis, which possessed equal rights with the three tribes of the Hylleis, Pamphyli, and Dymanatae, into which the Dorian conquerors were divided. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdoris">Doris</ref>.) Sicyon, on account of the small extent of its territory, never attained much political importance, and was generally dependent either on Argos or Sparta. At the time of the Second Messenian War it became subject to a succession of tyrants, who administered their power with moderation and justice for a hundred years. The first of these tyrants was Andreas, who began to rule B.C. 676. He was followed in succession by Myron, Aristonymus, and Clisthenes, on whose death, about 576, a republican form of government was established. Clisthenes had no male children, but only a daughter, Agaristé, who was married to the Athenian Megacles. In the Persian Wars the Sicyonians sent fifteen ships to the battle of Salamis, and three hundred hoplites to the battle of Plataea. In the interval between the Persian and the Peloponnesian Wars the Sicyonians were twice defeated and their country laid <cb /> waste by the Athenians, first under Tolmides in 456, and again under Pericles in 454. In the Peloponnesian War they took part with the Spartans. From this time till the Macedonian supremacy their history requires no special mention; but in the middle of the third century Sicyon took an active part in public affairs in consequence of its being the native town of Aratus, who united it to the Achaean League in 251. Under the Romans it gradually declined; and in the time of Pausanias, in the second century of the Christian era, many of its public buildings were in ruins. These ruins have been of late carefully studied by the members of the American School at Athens, who have excavated the tiers of seats and supports of the stage of a theatre. The position of the Acropolis, the temple of the Dioscuri, and the Stadium can also still be traced. (See the reports of the American School in <title>Papers of the American School at Athens</title>, vol. v.</p>
 <p>Sicyon was for a long time the chief seat of Grecian art. It gave its name to one of the great schools of painting, which was founded by Eupompus, and which produced Pamphilus and Apelles. It is also said to have been the earliest school of statuary in Greece, which was introduced into Sicyon by Dipoenus and Scyllis from Crete about 560; but its earliest native artist of celebrity was Canachus. Lysippus was also a native of Sicyon.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σιδών</foreign>, Old Test. Zidon). Now Saida; a city of Phoenicia, long the most powerful of that country's towns. It stood in a plain about a mile from the Mediterranean Sea, and some twenty miles north of Tyre, and with a double harbour of considerable extent, now filled with sand. Until Tyre wrested from it the maritime supremacy, it was the greatest commercial city of the Phoenicians. When Xerxes invaded Greece, the people of Sidon furnished his expedition with the best ships in the whole fleet, so that the king of Sidon had the chief place in the council of the Persian king. The city was burned at the time of its revolt against Artaxerxes III. (B.C. 351), but was rebuilt, and later fell with the whole of Phoenicia under the control of the Romans.

In the time of the manipular arrangement (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslegio">Legio</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmanipulus">Manipulus</ref>), each maniple had its peculiar <seg lang="la">insigne</seg>, the eagle (the sign of the first <seg lang="la">manipulus</seg>), the <ref type="cross" target="crosswolf">wolf, the Minotaur, the horse, or the boar. After Marius had made the eagle</ref> (q.v.) the standard representing the signum of the whole legion, the forms of other animals were no longer employed. Instead of them the maniples had a spear with an outstretched hand upon the point. Afterwards the signa were also furnished with a <seg lang="la">vexillum</seg> and with various ornaments on the pole, especially round plates, often with representations of gods, emperors, and generals.

This last is to be seen on monuments among the standards of foreign nations, who also had a standard resembling a mediaeval banner.

A.</title> i. 543</bibl>). In every other respect he is described as resembling his brethren in their love of sleep, wine, and music. He is mentioned, along with Marsyas and Olympus, as the inventor of the flute, which he is often seen playing; and a special kind of dance was called after him “Silenus,” while he himself is designated as the dancer. But it is a peculiar feature in his character that he was conceived also as an inspired prophet, who knew all the past and the most distant future, and as a sage who despised all the gifts of fortune. When he was drunk and asleep, he was in the power of mortals, who might compel him to prophesy and sing by surrounding him with chains of flowers. Silenus was probably at first a deity presiding over springs and running streams, and so the wine-skin with which he is frequently represented was doubtless originally a water-skin (Lucian, <bibl n="Luc.

 <p>(for the name, see <title>C. I. L.</title> vi. 1984). A Roman poet, born about A.D. 25. <cb /> He acquired great reputation as an advocate, and was afterwards one of the centumviri. He was consul in 68, the year in which Nero perished; he was admitted to familiar intercourse with Vitellius, and was subsequently proconsul of Asia. In his seventy-fifth year, in consequence of the pain caused by an incurable disease, he starved himself to death in the house once occupied by Vergil (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> iii. 7). The great work of Silius Italicus was a heroic poem in seventeen books, entitled <title>Punica</title>, which has descended to us entire, having been discovered by Poggio <ref type="cross" target="crossbracciolini">Bracciolini</ref> (q.v.) in 1416. The poem contains about 14,000 lines. Its opposing heroes are Scipio and Hannibal, and it deals with the Second Punic War in a spirit slavishly imitative of Vergil, to whom, by the way, he owed his estate at Naples. He also draws many ideas from the Homeric poems. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> appeared in 1471.

(1) Of Amorgos, the second, both in time and in reputation, of the three principal iambic poets of the early period of Greek literature—namely, Archilochus, Simonides, and Hipponax. He was a native of Samos, whence he led a colony to the neighbouring island of Amorgos, where he founded three cities—Minoa, Aegialus, and Arcesiné—in the first of which he fixed his own abode. He flourished about B.C. 664. Simonides was most celebrated for his iambic poems, which were of two species, gnomic and satirical. The most important of his extant fragments is a satire upon women, in which he derives the various, though generally bad, qualities of women from the variety of their origin: thus, the uncleanly woman is formed from the swine; the cunning woman, from the fox; the talkative woman, from the dog, and so on.

 <p>(2) Of Ceos, one of the most celebrated lyric poets of Greece. He was the perfecter of the Elegy and Epigram, and the rival of Lasus and Pindar in the Dithyramb and the Epinician Ode. He was born at Iulis, in Ceos, B.C. 556, and was the son of Leoprepes. He appears to have been brought up to music and poetry as a profession. From his native island he proceeded to Athens, probably on the invitation of Hipparchus, who attached him to his society by great rewards. After remaining at Athens some time, probably even after the expulsion of Hippias, he went to Thessaly, where he lived under the patronage of the Aleuads and Scopads. He afterwards returned to Athens, and soon had the noblest opportunity of employing his poetic powers in the celebration of the great events of the Persian Wars. In 489 he conquered Aeschylus in the contest for the prize which the Athenians offered for an elegy on those who fell at Marathon. Ten years later he composed the epigrams which were inscribed upon the tomb of the Spartans who fell at Thermopylae, as well as an encomium on the same heroes; and he also celebrated the battles of Artemisium and Salamis, and the great men who commanded in them (Pausan. iii. 8, 2; Thucyd. i. 132). He had completed his eightieth year, when his long poetical career at Athens was crowned by the victory which he gained with the dithyrambic chorus (477), being the fifty-sixth prize which he had carried off. Shortly after this he was invited to Syracuse by Hiero, at whose court he lived till his death in 467.

 <p>Simonides was a great favourite with Hiero, and was treated by the tyrant with the greatest munificence. He still continued, when at Syracuse, to employ his talents occasionally in the service of other Grecian States. Simonides is said to have been the inventor of the mnemonic art and of the long vowels and double letters in the Greek alphabet ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 2. 352" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>De Orat.</title> ii. 86, 352</bibl>). He made literature a profession, and is said to have been the first who took money for his poems; and the reproach of avarice is too often brought against him by his contemporary and rival, Pindar, as well as by subsequent writers, to be altogether discredited. The chief characteristics of the poetry of Simonides were sweetness (whence his surname of <title>Melicertes</title>) and elaborate finish, combined with the truest poetic conception and perfect power of expression; though in originality and fervour he was far inferior, not only to the early lyric poets, such as Sappho and Alcaeus, but also to his contemporary Pindar. He was probably both the most prolific and the most universally popular of all the Grecian lyric poets. The general character of his dialect is the Epic, mingled with Doric and Aeolic forms. Editions of his fragments are those by Schneidewin <bibl default="NO">(Brunswick, 1835)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO">Bergk, <title>Poët. Lyr. Graec.</title> (1878)</bibl>.

 <p> A Peripatetic philosopher of the sixth century after Christ, and a native of Cilicia. When Justinian in A.D. 529 closed the school of philosophy in which he taught at Athens, he and six other philosophers emigrated to the court of the Persian king Chosroës. When he made peace with Justinian in 533, and obtained from him leave for the philosophers to return unmolested, Simplicius went to Alexandria, where he died in 549.

Homer describes them as dwelling between Circé's isle and Scylla, on an island, where they sit in a flowery meadow, surrounded by the mouldering bones of men, and with their sweet song allure and infatuate those that sail by. Whoever listens to their song and draws near them never again beholds wife and child. They know everything that happens on earth.

There they were said to have settled, after vainly searching the whole earth for the lost Persephoné, their former playmate in the meadows by the Acheloüs; and later legend also assigned this at the time when they in part assumed a winged shape. They were represented as great birds with the heads of women, or with the upper part of the body like that of a woman, with the legs of birds, and with or without wings. At a later period they were sometimes regarded as retaining their original character of fair and cruel tempters and deceivers. But they are more generally represented as singers of the dirge for the dead, and they were hence frequently placed as an ornament on tombs; or as symbols of the magic of beauty, eloquence, and song, on which account their sculptured forms were seen on the funeral monuments of fair women and girls, and of orators and poets— for instance, on those of Isocrates and Sophocles. The National Museum at Athens contains several examples of stone Sirens, not as reliefs, but as separate figures; and a funeral monument of this type may be noticed on a vase in the British Museum, where the Siren is standing on a pillar and playing the lyre.

 the father of Odysseus by Anticlea (see <ref type="cross" target="crossanticlea">Anticlea</ref>); whence we find Odysseus sometimes called <title>Sisyphides</title> ( <title>Philoct.</title> 417). He is said to have built the town of Ephyra, afterwards Corinth. As king of Corinth he promoted navigation and commerce, but he was fraudulent, avaricious, and deceitful. His wickedness during life was severely punished in the lower world, where he had to roll up hill a huge marble block, which as soon as it reached the top always rolled down again. The special reasons for this punishment are not the same in all authors: some relate that it was because he had betrayed the designs of the gods; others because he attacked travellers, and killed them with a huge block of stone; and others again because he had betrayed to Asopus that Zeus had carried off Aegina, the daughter of the latter. The more usual tradition related that Sisyphus requested his wife not to bury him, and that, when she complied with his request, Sisyphus in the lower world complained of this seeming neglect, and obtained from Pluto or Persephoné permission to return to the upper world to punish his wife. He then refused to return to the lower world, until Hermes carried him off by force; and this piece of treachery is said to have been the cause of his punishment (Theog. 703; Eustath. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Hom. pp. 631<bibl n="Hom.  1702" default="NO">Hom., 1702</bibl>).

His real name was <hi rend="SmallCaps">Bardes</hi>. The death of Smerdis was kept a profound secret; and accordingly, when the Persians became weary of the tyranny of Cambyses, one of the Magians, called by Herodotus Patizithes, who had been left by Cambyses in charge of his palace and treasures, availed himself of the likeness of his brother Gaumates to the deceased Smerdis to proclaim this brother as king, representing him as the younger son of Cyrus. Cambyses heard of the revolt in Syria, but he died of 
<pb n="1472" /><cb />
 an accidental wound in the thigh as he was mounting his horse to march against the usurper. The false Smerdis was acknowledged as king by the Persians, and reigned for seven months without opposition. The leading Persian nobles, however, were not quite free from suspicion; and this suspicion was increased by the king never inviting any of them to the palace, and never appearing in public. Among the nobles who entertained these suspicions was Otanes, whose daughter Phaedima had been one of the wives of Cambyses, and had been transferred to his successor. The new king had some years before been deprived of his ears by Cyrus for some offence; and Otanes persuaded his daughter to ascertain whether her master had really lost his ears. Phaedima found out that such was the fact, and communicated the decisive information to her father. Otanes thereupon formed a conspiracy, and, in conjunction with six other noble Persians, succeeded in forcing his way into the palace, where they slew the false Smerdis and his brother Patizithes in the eighth month of their reign, B.C. 521 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 30</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  61" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 61</bibl>-79). The usurpation of the false Smerdis was an attempt on the part of the Medes, to whom the Magians belonged, to obtain the supremacy, of which they had been deprived by Cyrus. The assassination of Gaumates and the accession of Darius Hystaspis again gave the ascendency to the Persians; and the anniversary of the day on which the Magians were massacred was commemorated among the Persians by a festival, called Magophonia, on which no Magian was allowed to show himself in public. The real nature of the transaction is also shown by the revolt of the Medes after the accession of Darius.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σμύρνα</foreign>), and in some manuscripts <hi rend="bold">Zmyrna.</hi> Now Smyrna (Turkish, Izmir); an ancient city of Asia Minor, the only one of the great cities on the coast that still remains of importance as a commercial port. It lay on the river Meles at the eastern end of the Sinus Smyrnaeus, whose depth allowed the largest ships to anchor at the very walls of the city. From it stretched back the great valley of the Hermus, in which lay the rich city of <ref type="cross" target="crosssardis">Sardis</ref> (q.v.), of which Smyrna served as the principal seaport. It was probably Aeolian in its origin, founded by colonists from Cymé (<bibl n="Hdt.  1. 150" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 150</bibl>; Pausan. vii. 5, 1), <cb /> but became a possession of the Ionians of Colophon, and from that time was politically classed with the Ionian cities. As to the time when it became a member of the Panionic Confederacy, we have only a very untrustworthy account, which refers its admission to the reign of Attalus, king of Pergamum. Its early history is also very obscure. There is an account in Strabo (p. 646) that it was destroyed by the Lydian king Sadyattes, and that its inhabitants were compelled to live in scattered villages until after the Macedonian conquest, when the city was rebuilt, twenty stadia from its former site, by Antigonus; but this is inconsistent with Pindar's mention of Smyrna as a beautiful city ( <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 155" default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>155</bibl>). Thus much is clear, however, that at some period the old city of Smyrna, which stood on the northeastern side of the Hermaean Gulf, was abandoned, and that it was succeeded by a new city on the southeastern side of the same gulf (the present site), which is said to have been built by Antigonus, and which was enlarged and beautified by Lysimachus. This new city stood partly on the sea-shore and partly on a hill called Mastusia. The streets were paved with stone, and crossed one another at right angles. The city soon became one of the greatest and most prosperous in the world. It was especially favoured by the Romans on account of the aid it rendered them in the Syrian and Mithridatic Wars. It was the seat of a <seg lang="la">conventus iuridicus.</seg> In the Civil Wars it was taken <figure id="fig.01472">
<head orig="Coin of Smyrna. (Second century B.C.)">Coin of Smyrna. (Second century B.C.)</head>
</figure> and partly destroyed by Dolabella, but it soon recovered. It occupies a distinguished place in the early history of Christianity, as one of the only two among the Seven Churches of Asia which St. John addresses in the Apocalypse without any admixture of rebuke, and as the scene of the labours and martyrdom of Polycarp. In the years A.D. 178- 180 a succession of earthquakes, to which the city has always been much exposed, reduced it almost to ruins; but it was restored by the emperor M. Antoninus. In the successive wars under the Eastern Empire it was frequently much injured, but always recovered; and, under the Turks, who took it in A.D. 1424, it has survived repeated attacks of earthquake, fire, and plague, and still remains the great commercial city of the Levant. There are but few ruins of the ancient city. In addition to her other sources of renown, Smyrna stood at the head of the seven cities which claimed the birth of Homer. The poet was worshipped as a hero in a magnificent building called the Homereum (<foreign lang="greek">Ὁμήρειον</foreign>). Near the sea-shore there stood a magnificent temple of Cybelé, whose head decorated the coins of the city.

 <p> Among the Romans the socii, as distinguished in constitutional law from Roman subjects, were the allies who, while their independence was recognized, stood in a more or less dependent relation to the Roman State. Under the Republic, up to the time when the right of citizenship was conferred on all the free inhabitants of Italy (B.C. 89), the Latins, and the Italian communities on the same footing with them, enjoyed a privileged position among the other allies. In the military organization of the Roman Republic the contingents which they furnished were called <seg lang="la">socii</seg> in contradistinction to the legions and the non-Italian auxiliaries.

<head orig="Socrătes">Socrates</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σωκράτης</foreign>). (1) An Athenian philosopher, whose teaching revolutionized the whole drift of subsequent philosophical speculation. He was born in the deme Alopecé, near Athens, B.C. 469. His father, Sophroniscus, was a sculptor, and his mother, Phaenareté, was a midwife. In his youth Socrates for a time followed his father's occupation, and a group of sculptured Graces, preserved in the Acropolis, was exhibited as his work down to the time of Pausanias; but there is reason to believe that this arose from a confusion of names. It is thought by some that the relief of draped Graces in the Museo Chiaramonte in Rome represents the Athenian group, in which case it must have belonged to an earlier period of art than the century in which Socrates lived.</p>
 <p>The personal qualities of Socrates were marked, and such as would readily attract attention. He enjoyed vigorous health, and was so robust as to be capable of enduring fatigue and hardship to a degree that astonished all who knew him. He went barefooted at all seasons of the year; and this not merely at Athens, but when serving as a soldier in the much colder climate of Thrace; and he wore the same clothing in winter as in summer. His features were of remarkable ugliness; and his flat nose, thick lips, and bulging eyes led to his being compared to a satyr.</p>
 <p>As to the particulars of his life, there is no connected account. It is known that he served as a heavy-armed soldier at Potidaea, Delium, and Amphipolis; but he seems not to have filled any public office until B.C. 406, when he was a member of the Senate of Five Hundred, and as such refused, in spite of all personal risk, to put an unconstitutional question to vote. He displayed the same moral courage in refusing to obey the order of the Thirty Tyrants for the arrest of Leon of Salamis.</p>
 <p>From the period of his middle life, at any rate, he devoted his time wholly to the self-imposed task of teaching, giving up all other business, both public and private, and neglecting all means of acquiring a fortune. It was probably his remissness in this respect which was responsible for the ill-temper and fretfulness of his wife Xanthippé, whose name has passed into all modern tongues as the type of a shrew. Socrates never opened a school and never lectured publicly, nor did he receive any money for his teaching, but went about in the most public parts of the city, such as the <figure id="fig.01473.3">
<head orig="Socrates. (Vatican.)">Socrates. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> market-place, the gymnasia, and the work-shops, seeking opportunities for awakening in the young and old alike moral consciousness and an impulse towards self-knowledge with respect to the end and value of human action. His object, however, was only to aid those with whom he talked in developing such germs of knowledge as were already present in them, and not to communicate to them dogmatically 
<pb n="1474" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01474">
<head orig="So-called Prison of Socrates at Athens.">So-called Prison of Socrates at Athens.</head>
</figure> any knowledge of his own. He was especially severe upon false pretences and intellectual conceit; and, consequently, to many persons he became exceedingly obnoxious, and was the object of much dislike and misrepresentation. This is probably the reason why Aristophanes, in <title>The Clouds</title>, selected Socrates as the type of men engaged in philosophical and rhetorical teaching; the more so, as his grotesque physiognomy admitted so well of being imitated in the mask which the actor wore. The audience at the theatre would more readily recognize the peculiar figure which they were accustomed to see every day in the market-place than if Prodicus or Protagoras, whom most of them did not know by sight, had been brought on the stage; nor was it of much importance either to them or to Aristophanes whether Socrates was represented as teaching what he did really teach, or something utterly different.</p>
 <p>Attached to none of the prevailing parties, Socrates found in each of them his friends and his enemies. Hated and persecuted by Critias , Charicles, and others among the Thirty Tyrants, who had a special reference to him in the decree which they issued, forbidding the teaching of the art of oratory, he was impeached after their banishment and by their opponents. An orator named Lycon, and a poet (a friend of Thrasybulus) named Meletus, had united in the impeachment with the powerful demagogue Anytus, an embittered antagonist of the Sophists and their system, and one of the leaders of the band which, setting out from Phylé, forced their way into the Piraeus, and drove out the Thirty Tyrants. The judges also are described as persons who had been banished, and who had returned with Thrasybulus. The chief articles of <cb /> impeachment were that Socrates was guilty of corrupting the youth and of despising the tutelary deities of the State, putting in their place other new divinities. At the same time it had been made a matter of accusation against him that Critias , the most ruthless of the Tyrants, had come forth from his school. Some expressions of his, in which he had found fault with the democratic mode of electing by lot, had also been brought up against him; and there can be little doubt that use was made of his friendly relations with Theramenes, one of the most influential of the Thirty, with Plato's uncle Charmides, who fell by the side of Critias in the struggle with the popular party, and with other aristocrats, in order to irritate against him the party which at that time was dominant. The substance of the speech which Socrates delivered in his defence is probably preserved by Plato in the discourse which goes under the name of the “Apology of Socrates.” Being condemned by a majority of only six votes, he expresses the conviction that he deserved to be maintained at the public cost in the Prytaneum, and refuses to acquiesce in the adjudication of imprisonment or a large fine or banishment. He will assent to nothing more than a fine of sixty minae, on the security of Plato, Crito , and other friends. Condemned to death by the judges, who were incensed by this speech, by a majority of eighty votes, he departs from them with the protestation that he would rather die after such a defence than live after one in which he should have endeavoured to excite their pity. The sentence of death could not be carried into execution until after the return of the vessel which had been sent to Delos on the periodical Theoric mission. The thirty days which intervened between its return and the condemnation of Socrates were devoted by him in prison to poetic attempts (the first he had made in his life) and to his usual conversation with his friends. One of these conversations, on the duty of obedience to the laws, Plato has reported in the <title>Crito</title>, so called after the faithful follower of Socrates, who had endeavoured without success to persuade him to make his escape. In another, imitated or worked up by Plato in the <title>Phaedo</title>, Socrates immediately before he drank the cup of hemlock developed the grounds of his immovable conviction of the immortality of the soul. He died with composure and cheerfulness in his seventieth year, B.C. 399.</p>
 <p>Three peculiarities distinguished Socrates: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) His long life passed in contented poverty and in public dialectics, of which we have already spoken. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) His persuasion of a special religious mission. He had been accustomed constantly to hear, even from his childhood, a divine voice— interfering, at moments when he was about to act, in the way of restraint, but never in the way of instigation. Such prohibitory warning was wont to come upon him very frequently, not merely on great but even on small occasions, intercepting what he was about to do or to say. Though later writers speak of this as the Daemon or Genius of Socrates, he himself did not personify it, but treated it merely as a “divine sign, a prophetic or supernatural voice.” He was accustomed not only to obey it implicitly, but to speak of it publicly and familiarly to others, so that the fact was well known both to his friends and to his enemies. See a paper by H. Jackson in the 
<pb n="1475" /><cb /> English <title>Journal of Philology</title>, vol. v., and <bibl default="NO">Freymüller, <title>De Socratis Daemonio</title> (1864)</bibl>. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) His great intellectual originality, both of subject and of method, and his power of stirring and forcing the germ of inquiry and ratiocination in others. He was the first who turned his thoughts and discussions distinctly to the subject of ethics, and was the first to proclaim that “the proper study of mankind is man.” With the philosophers who preceded him, the subject of examination had been Nature, or the Cosmos as one undistinguishable whole, blending together cosmogony, astronomy, geometry, physics, metaphysics, etc. In discussing ethical subjects Socrates employed the dialectic method, and thus laid the foundation of formal logic, which was afterwards expanded by Plato and systematized by Aristotle.</p>
 <p>The originality of Socrates is shown by the results he achieved. Out of his intellectual school sprang not merely Plato, himself a host, but all the other leaders of Grecian speculation for the next half century, and all those who continued the great line of speculative philosophy down to later times. Euclid and the Megaric School of philosophers—Aristippus and the Cyrenaic Antisthenes and Diogenes, the first of those called the Cynics—all emanated more or less directly from the stimulus imparted by Socrates, and so, for that matter, did the Stoics and Epicureans, though each followed a different vein of thought. Ethics continued to be what Socrates had first made them —a distinct branch of philosophy—alongside of which politics, rhetoric, logic, and other speculations relating to man and society gradually arranged themselves; all of them more popular, as well as more keenly controverted, than physics, which at that time presented comparatively little charm, and still less of attainable certainty. There can be no doubt that the individual influence of Socrates permanently enlarged the horizon, improved the method, and multiplied the ascendant minds, of the Grecian speculative world, in a manner never since paralleled. Subsequent philosophers had a more elaborate doctrine and a larger number of disciples who imbibed their ideas; but none of them applied the same stimulating method with the same efficacy, and none of them so struck out of other minds that fire which sets light to original thought.</p>

 <p>(2) An ecclesiastical historian, born at Constantinople about A.D. 379. He was a pupil of Ammonius and Helladius, and followed the profession of an advocate in his native city, whence he is surnamed Scholasticus. The <title>Ecclesiastical History</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐκκλησιαστικὴ Ἱστορία</foreign>) of Socrates extends from the reign of Constantine the Great, 306, to that of the younger Theodosius, 439. He appears to have been a man of less bigotry than most of his contemporaries, and the very difficulty of determining from internal evidence some points of his religious belief may be considered as arguing his comparative liberality. His history is divided into seven books. His work is edited by Hussey <cb /> <bibl default="NO">(1853)</bibl> and Bright, with an introduction <bibl default="NO">(1878)</bibl>; and is translated into English in Schaff's Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2d series, vol. ii. <bibl default="NO">(New York, 1891)</bibl>.

 <p> The word properly means an association or club, and was especially applied to the religious brotherhoods among the Romans. By order of the State, they attended to the cult of some particular object of worship by jointly celebrating certain sacrifices and feasts, especially on the anniversary of the foundation of that cult.</p>
 <p>The members, called <seg lang="la">sodales</seg>, stood in a legally recognized position of mutual obligation, which did not allow any one of them to appear against another as a prosecutor in a criminal case, or to become <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> of the prosecutor of a <seg lang="la">sodalis</seg>, or to officiate as judge upon a <seg lang="la">sodalis.</seg> Such a brotherhood were the Sodales Augustales, appointed A.D. 14 by the Senate for the cult of the deified Augustus, a college of twenty-one, and afterwards of twenty-eight members of senatorial rank, which also took upon itself the cult of Claudius after his deification, and bore, after that, the official title Sodales Augustales Claudiales. Besides these, there were the Sodales Flaviales Titiales for the cult of Vespasian and Titus, the Hadrianales for that of Hadrian, Antoniniani for that of Antoninus Pius and of the successively deified emperors (cp.

 <p>The secular clubs, <seg lang="la">sodalitates</seg> or <seg lang="la">collegia sodalicia</seg>, were, in the later Republican age, much turned to account for political objects, and their organization used for purposes of bribery. (See Cicero's speech <title>Pro Plancio.</title>)

<div2 id="crosssolon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Solōn">Solon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σόλων</foreign>). A celebrated Athenian legislator, born about B.C. 638. His father Execestides was a descendant of Codrus, and his mother was a cousin of the mother of Pisistratus. Execestides had seriously crippled his resources by a too prodigal expenditure; and Solon consequently found it either necessary or convenient in his youth to betake himself to the life of a foreign trader. It is likely enough that while necessity compelled him to seek a livelihood in some mode or other, his active and inquiring spirit led him to select that pursuit which would furnish the amplest means for its gratification. Solon early distinguished himself by his poetical abilities. His first effusions were in a somewhat light and amatory strain, which afterwards gave way to the more dignified and earnest purpose of inculcating profound reflections or sage advice. So widely indeed did his reputation spread that he was ranked as one of the famous Seven <ref type="cross" target="crosssages">Sages</ref> (q.v.), and his name appears in all the lists of the seven. The occasion which first brought Solon prominently forward as an actor on the political stage was the contest between Athens and Megara respecting the possession of Salamis. The ill success of the attempts of the Athenians to make themselves masters of the island had led to the enactment of a law forbidding the writing or saying anything to urge the Athenians to renew the attempt. Soon after these events (about 595) Solon took a leading part in promoting hostilities on behalf of Delphi against Cirrha, and was the mover of the decree of the Amphictyons by which war was declared. It does not appear, however, what active part he took in the war. According to a common story, which, however, rests only on the authority of a late writer, Solon hastened the surrender of the town by causing the waters of the Plistus to be poisoned. It was about the time of the outbreak of this war that, in consequence of the distracted condition of Attica, which was rent by civil commotions, Solon was called upon by all parties to mediate between them, and alleviate the miseries that prevailed. He was chosen archon in 594, and under that legal title was invested with unlimited power for adopting such measures as the exigencies of the State demanded.</p>
 <p>In fulfilment of the task intrusted to him, Solon addressed himself to the relief of the existing distress. This he effected with the greatest discretion and success by his celebrated “disburdening ordinance” (<foreign lang="greek">σεισάχθεια</foreign>), a measure consisting of various distinct provisions, calculated to relieve the debtors with as little infringement as possible 
<pb n="1477" /><cb />
 on the claims of the wealthy creditors. He also changed the standard of the monetary system from the Phidonian to the Euboic, which was the one generally in use in the great centres of commerce, Chalcis and Eretria, so that Athenian trade might be simplified in its exchanges (Aristotle, <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ath. Pol.</title>10</bibl>). A limit was also set to the rate of interest and to the accumulation of land (Aristotle, <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ath. Pol.</title>6</bibl>). The success of the Seisachtheia procured for Solon such confidence and popularity that he was further charged with the task of entirely remodelling the constitution. As a preliminary step, he repealed all the laws of <ref type="cross" target="crossdraco">Draco</ref> (q.v.), except those relating to bloodshed. The principal features of the Solonian Constitution may be briefly summarized for the benefit of the reader. The State as he left it was a timocracy (<foreign lang="greek">τιμοκρατία</foreign>), that is to say, a form of oligarchy (<foreign lang="greek">ὀλιγαρχία</foreign>) in which the possession of a certain amount of property is requisite for admission to the ruling class. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossoligarchia">Oligarchia</ref>.) Solon established a sort of timocratic scale, so that those who did not belong to the nobility received the rights of citizens in a proportion determined partly by their property and their corresponding services to the State. For this purpose he divided the population into four classes, founded on the possession of land. (1) Pentacosiomedimni (<foreign lang="greek">Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι</foreign>), who had at least 500 <seg lang="la">medimni</seg> (750 bushels) of corn or <seg lang="la">metretae</seg> of wine or oil as yearly income.</p>
 <p>(2) Hippeis (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππεῖς, Ἱππῆς</foreign>), or knights, with at least 300 <seg lang="la">medimni.</seg></p>

 <p>(4) Thetes (<foreign lang="greek">Θῆτες</foreign>) (workers for wages), with less than 150 <seg lang="la">medimni</seg> of yearly income. Solon's legislation only granted to the first three of these four classes a vote in the election of responsible officers, and only to the first class the power of election to the highest offices; as, for instance, that of archon. The fourth class was excluded from all official positions, but possessed the right of voting in the general public assemblies which chose officials and passed laws. They had also the right of taking part in the trials by jury which Solon had instituted. The first three classes were bound to serve as hoplites; the cavalry was raised out of the first two, while the fourth class was only employed as light-armed troops or on the fleet, and apparently for pay. The others served without pay. The first three classes alone were subject to direct taxation. The holders of office in the State were also unpaid. Solon established as the chief consultative body the Council of the Four Hundred (see <ref type="cross" target="crossboule">Boulé</ref>), in which only the first three classes took part, and as chief administrative body the <ref type="cross" target="crossareopagus">Areopagus</ref> (q.v.), which was to be filled up by those who had been archons. A Council of 401 members is said to have been part of Draco's constitution (about B.C. 621), the members being selected by lot from the whole body of citizens. Solon reduced the Council to 400, one hundred from each of the four tribes; and extended in some particulars the powers already possessed by the Areopagus (Aristotle, <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ath. Pol.</title>4</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> Ath. Pol., 8</bibl>). Besides this, he promulgated a code of laws embracing the whole of public and private life, the salutary effects of which lasted long after the end of his constitution. He also rectified the calendar, and regulated the system of weights and measures. He forbade the exportation of Attic products, except olive oil. Among his other regulations were those giving to childless <cb /> persons the power of disposing of their property by will, punishing idleness, inflicting <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign> on those citizens who in the time of any sedition remained neutral, and giving great rewards to the victors in the Olympian and Isthmian Games.</p>
 <p>The laws of Solon were inscribed on wooden cylinders (<foreign lang="greek">ἄξονες</foreign>) and triangular tablets (<foreign lang="greek">κύρβεις</foreign>), and set up in the Acropolis, and later in the Prytaneum. Solon himself spoke of them as being not the best laws conceivable, but the best that the Athenians could be induced to accept. His Constitution was, in fact, a compromise between democracy proper and oligarchy, and it gives to Solon a title to rank with the great constructive statesmen of all time.</p>
 <p>The great lawgiver's later history must be regarded as more legendary than authentic. After completing his task of legislation he left Athens for ten years, after exacting from the people a promise that they would leave his laws unaltered for that space of time (Aristotle, <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ath. Pol.</title>11</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 29</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>25</bibl>). After visiting Egypt, he is said to have gone to Cyprus, where he was received by the king of the little town of Aepea. Solon persuaded the king, Philocyprus, to remove from the old site and build a new town on the plain. The new settlement was called Soli, in honour of the illustrious visitor ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 113" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 113</bibl>). He is further said to have visited Lydia; and his interview with Croesus was one of the most celebrated stories in antiquity. “Who is the happiest man you have ever seen?” asked the magnificent king, fishing for a compliment. “I can speak of no one as happy until I have seen how his life has ended,” replied the philosopher, thus giving deep offence to the monarch ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 32</bibl>). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscroesus">Croesus</ref>.</p>
 <p>During the absence of Solon the old dissensions were renewed, and shortly after his arrival at Athens the supreme power was seized by Pisistratus. The tyrant, after his usurpation, is said to have paid considerable court to Solon, and on various occasions to have solicited his advice, which Solon did not withhold. Solon probably died about 558, two years after the overthrow of the Constitution, at the age of eighty. There was a story current in antiquity that, by his own directions, his ashes were collected and scattered round the island of Salamis. Of the poems of Solon several fragments remain. They do not indicate any great degree of imaginative power, but their style is vigorous and simple; and those that were called forth by special emergencies appear to have been marked by no small degree of energy.</p>

Sleep was represented in art in various forms and situations, and frequently with the wings of an eagle or a butterfly on his forehead, and a poppy-stalk and a horn, from which he dropped slumber upon those whom he lulled to rest. The earlier conception made Dreams the sisters of Sleep, but in later times the dream-god figures as his son. Hermes was also a god of sleep.

<div2 id="crosssophistae" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sophistae">Sophistae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σοφισταί</foreign>). Strictly a name given by the Greeks to all those who professed knowledge, or a particular knowledge or a particular art. Hence the Seven Sages are often thus called; but the name was especially applied to the educated men of ready speech, who, from about the year B.C. 450, used to travel through Greece from place to place, and impart what they knew for money. These were the University Extension lecturers of antiquity, and they have the merit of having popularized the interest in knowledge which had up to that time been confined within narrow circles, and especially of having contributed to the formation of eloquence; for they were the first to make style an object of study, and to institute serious investigations into the art of rhetorical expression. Their teaching was chiefly intended to give their pupils versatility in the use of speech, and thus to fit them for taking part in public life. As the subject of their discourses, they chose by preference questions of public interest to persons of general education. The expression, however, always remained the important thing, while positive knowledge fell more and more into the background. Some of them even started from the position that virtue and knowledge were only subjective notions. Protagoras of Abdera, who appeared about B.C. 445, is named as the first Sophist; after him the most important is Gorgias of Leontini; Prodicus of Ceos and Hippias of Elis are contemporaries of the other two. Wherever they appeared, especially in Athens, they were received with the greatest enthusiasm, and many flocked to hear them. Even such men as Pericles, Euripides, and Socrates sought their society; and Socrates owed to them much that was suggestive in his own pursuit of practical philosophy, though, on the other hand, he persistently attacked the principles underlying their public teaching. These principles became further exaggerated under their successors, who did not think they needed even knowledge of fact to talk as they pleased about everything. Accordingly the skill of the Sophists degenerated into mere technicalities and complete absence of reason, and became absolutely contemptible. (See Grote, <title>History of Greece</title>, ch. lxvii., and Sidgwick's essay in the (English) <title>Journal of Philology</title>, iv. 288.)</p>
 <p>With the revival of Greek eloquence, from about the beginning of the second century A.D., the name of Sophist attained a new distinction. At that time the name was given to the professional orators, who appeared in public with great pomp and delivered declamations either prepared beforehand or improvised on the spot. Like the earlier Sophists, they went generally from place to place, and were overwhelmed with applause and with marks of distinction by their contemporaries, including even the Roman emperors. Dion Chrysostom, Herodes Atticus, Aristides, Lucian, and Philostratus the Elder belong to the flourishing period of this second school of Sophists, a period which extends over the whole of the second century. They appear afresh about the middle of the fourth century, devoting their philosophic culture to the zealous but unavailing defence of paganism. Among them was the emperor Julian and his contemporaries Libanius, Himerius, and Themistius. 
<pb n="1479" /><cb /> Synesius may be considered as the last Sophist of importance. See A. W. Benn, <title>Greek Philosophers</title>, ch. ii. <bibl default="NO">(London, 1883)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosssophocles" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sophŏcles">Sophocles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σοφοκλῆς</foreign>). (1) The second of the three great Greek tragedians, son of Sophilus or Sophillus, the wealthy owner of a manufactory of arms. He was born about B.C. 495 in the deme Colonus near Athens. He received a careful education in music, gymnastics, and dancing, and as a boy of fifteen was chosen to lead the paean sung by the chorus of boys after the victory of Salamis (Athen. p. 20). He afterwards showed his musical skill in public, when he represented the blind singer Thamyris in his drama of the same name, and played the cithara with such success that he was painted as Thamyris with the cithara in the Stoa Poicilé. Again, in the play called the <title>Nausicaa</title>, he won for himself general admiration in acting the part of the Phaeacian princess, by the dexterity and grace with which he struck the ball <figure id="fig.01479">
<head orig="Sophocles. (Lateran Museum, Rome.)">Sophocles. (Lateran Museum, Rome.)</head>
</figure> (Athen. p. 20 E). In all things his external appearance and demeanour were the reflex of a lofty mind. At his very first appearance as a tragic poet in 468, when twenty-seven years old, at the Great Dionysia, he gained a victory over Aeschylus, who was thirty years older, and from that time to extreme old age he kept the first place in tragedy. Unlike Aeschylus and Euripides, he never accepted the invitations of foreign princes. Though possessing no special inclination or fitness for political affairs, as his friend, the poet Ion of Chios, declares, he yet took his place in public life. Thus, in B.C. 440, he was one of the ten generals who, with Pericles, were in command of the fleet sent against Samos. Owing to his practical skill he was also employed in negotiations with the allies of Chios and Samos. During the Peloponnesian War he was again one of the generals, together with Nicias. In 435, as Hellenotamias, he was at the head of the management of the treasure of the allies, which was kept on the Acropolis; and, when the question arose in 413, of giving to the State an oligarchical constitution, he was on the commission of preliminary investigation (<title>C. I. A.</title> i. 237).</p>
 <p>The charm and refinement of his character seem to have won him many friends. Among them was the historian Herodotus, who much resembled him in taste and temperament. He was also deemed by the ancients a man specially beloved by the gods, especially by Asclepius, whose priest he probably was, and who was said to have granted him health <cb /> and vigour of mind to extreme old age. By the Athenian Nicostraté he had a son, Iophon , who won some repute as a tragic poet, and by Theoris of Sicyon another son, Ariston, father of the Sophocles who gained fame for himself by tragedies of his own, and afterwards by the production of his grandfather's dramas. There was a story that a quarrel arose between Sophocles and his son Iophon , on account of his preference for this grandson, and that, when summoned by Iophon before the court as weak in mind and unable to manage his affairs, he obtained his own absolute acquittal by reading the <hi rend="italic">parodos</hi> on his native place in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>, just written, but not yet produced (Plutarch, <title>Moral.</title> p. 775 B). But this appears to be a legend founded on a misunderstood pleasantry of a comic poet. The tales of his death, which happened in B.C. 405, are also mythical. According to one account, he was choked by a grape; according to others, he died either when publicly reciting the <title>Antigoné</title>, or from excessive joy at some dramatic victory. The only fact unanimonsly attested by his contemporaries is, that his death was as dignified as his life. A singular story is connected even with his funeral. We are told that Dionysus, by repeated apparitions in dreams, prompted the general of the Spartans, who were then investing Athens, to grant a truce for the burial of the poet in the family grave outside the city. On his tomb stood a Siren as a symbol of the charm of poetry. After his death the Athenians worshipped him as a hero and offered an annual sacrifice in his memory. In later times, on the proposal of the orator Lycurgus, a bronze statue was erected to him, together with Aeschylus and Euripides, in the theatre; and of his dramas, as of theirs, an authorized and standard copy was made, in order to protect them against arbitrary alterations.</p>
 <p>Sophocles was a very prolific poet. The number of his plays is given as between 123 and 130, of which above 100 are known to us by their titles and by fragments; but only seven have been preserved complete: the <title>Trachiniae</title> (so named from the chorus, and treating of the death of Heracles), the <title>Ajax</title>, the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the <title>Electra</title>, the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, the <title>Oedipus at Colonus</title>, and the <title>Antigoné.</title> The last-mentioned play was produced in the spring of 440; the <title>Philoctetes</title> in 410; the <title>Oedipus at Colonus</title> was not put on the stage until 401, after his death, by his grandson Sophocles. Besides tragedies, Sophocles composed paeans, elegies, epigrams, and a work in prose on the chorus. With his tragedies he gained the first prize more than twenty times, and still more often the second, but never the third. Even in his lifetime, and indeed through the whole of antiquity, he was held to be the most perfect of tragedians; one of the ancient writers calls him the “pupil of Homer.”</p>
 <p>If Aeschylus is the creator of Greek tragedy, it was Sophocles who brought it to perfection. He extended the dramatic action (1) by the introduction of a third actor, while in his last pieces he even added a fourth; and</p>
 <p>(2) by a due subordination of the chorus, to which, however, he gave a more artistic development, while he increased its numbers from twelve to fifteen persons. (See Reissenmayer, <title>De Choro Sophocleo</title> [1878]). He also perfected the costumes and decoration. Rejecting the plan of Aeschylus, by which one story was carried through three successive plays, he made every tragedy into a complete work of art, with a separate 
<pb n="1480" /><cb /> and complete action, the motives for every detail being most skilfully devised. His art was especially shown in the way in which the action is developed from the character of the <seg lang="la">dramatis personae.</seg> Sophocles' great mastery of his art appears, above all, in the clearness with which he portrays his characters, which are developed with a scrupulous attention to details, and in which he does not content himself, like Aeschylus, with mere outlines, nor, as Euripides often did, with copies from common life. His heroes, too, are ideal figures, like those of Aeschylus (Aristot. <title>Poët.</title> 25). While they lack the superhuman loftiness of the earlier poet's creations, they have a certain ideal truth of their own. Sophocles succeeded in doing what was impossible for Aeschylus and Euripides with their peculiar temperaments, in expressing the nobility of the female character, in its gentleness as well as in its heroic courage. In contrast to Euripides, Sophocles, like Aeschylus, is profoundly religious; and the attitude which he adopts towards the popular religion is marked by an instinctive reverence. The grace peculiar to Sophocles' nature makes itself felt even in his language, the charm of which was universally praised by the ancients. With his noble simplicity he takes in this respect also a middle place between the weightiness and boldness of the language of Aeschylus and the smoothness and rhetorical embellishment which distinguish that of Euripides.</p>
 <p>The seven existing plays of Sophocles are all found in the same Codex Laurentianus in Florence that contains the plays of Aeschylus. Cobet regards all the other extant MSS. of the plays as derived from this. Few of them have the whole seven. Of these, two (a Codex Parisinus of the thirteenth century and a Codex Venetus of the fourteenth) are the best.

<div2 id="crosssophonisba" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sophonisba">Sophonisba</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σοφόνισβα</foreign>). The daughter of the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal, the son of Gisco. She had been betrothed by her father, at a very early age, to the Numidian prince Masinissa, but at a subsequent period Hasdrubal, being desirous to gain over Syphax, the rival ruler of Numidia, to the Carthaginian alliance, gave her in marriage to that prince. After the defeat of Syphax, and the capture of his capital city of Cirta by Masinissa, Sophonisba fell into the hands of the conqueror, upon whom her beauty exercised so powerful an influence that he determined to marry her himself. Their wedding was accordingly celebrated without delay; but Scipio (who was apprehensive lest she should exercise the same influence over Masinissa which she had previously done over Syphax) refused to ratify this arrangement, and, upbraiding Masinissa with his weakness, insisted on the immediate surrender of the princess. Unable to resist this command, the Numidian king spared her the humiliation of captivity by sending her a bowl of poison, which she drank without hesitation, and thus put an end to her own life (<bibl n="Liv.  29. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxix. 23</bibl>; xxx. 3-15; Polyb. xiv. 1, 7; <bibl n="Zonar.  9. 11" default="NO">Zonar.ix. 11</bibl>-13). The story of Sophonisba is the subject of a drama in English by Thomson, produced in 1729.

<head orig="Sophron">Sophron</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σώφρων</foreign>). A native of Syracuse. He was a writer in Greek of mimes, and an elder contemporary of Euripides (about B.C. 460-420). He composed in the Dorian dialect prose dialogues, partly serious, partly comic, which faithfully represented scenes of actual life, mostly in the lower classes, interspersed with numerous proverbs and colloquial forms of speech. In spite of their prose form, Sophron's mimes were regarded as poems by the ancients. In Athens they are said to have become known through Plato, who thought very highly of them, and made use of them for the dramatic form of his dialogues ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 10</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  17" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 17</bibl>; <bibl n="Diog.  3. 13" default="NO">Diog.

In the Alexandrian Age, Theocritus took them for a pattern in his idylls (especially in the <title>Adoniazusae, Idyl.</title> 15). The Greek grammarians also paid particular attention to them on account of the popular idioms they contained. The fragments preserved are so scanty that they give no notion of the contents and form of the pieces; in any case they cannot have been intended for public representation. Sophron's son, Xenarchus, who lived during the reign of Dionysius I., also wrote mimes. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmimus">Mimus</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σπάρτη</foreign>, Dor. <foreign lang="greek">Σπάρτα</foreign>), also called <hi rend="bold">Lacedaemon</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Λακεδαίμων</foreign>). The capital of Laconica and the chief city of the Peloponnesus, was situated on the right bank of the Eurotas (Iri), about twenty miles from the sea. It stood on a plain which contained within it several rising grounds and hills. It was bounded on the east by the Eurotas, on the northwest by the small river Oenus (Kelesina), and on the southeast by the small river Tisia (Magula), both of which streams fell into the Eurotas. The plain in which Sparta stood was shut in on the east by Mount Menelaïeum, and on the west by Mount Taÿgetus; whence the city is called by Homer “the hollow Lacedaemon.” It was of a circular form, about six miles in circumference, and consisted of several distinct quarters, which were originally separate villages, and which were never united into one regular town. Its site is occupied by the modern villages of Magula and Psykhiko; and the principal modern town in the neighbourhood is Mistra, which lies about two miles to the west on Mount Taÿgetus.</p>
 <p>During the flourishing times of Greek independence, Sparta was never surrounded by walls, since the bravery of its citizens, and the difficulty of access to it, were supposed to render such defences needless. It was first fortified by the tyrant Nabis; but it did not possess regular walls until the time of the Romans. Sparta, unlike most Greek cities, had no proper Acropolis, but this name was given to one of the steepest hills of the town, on the summit of which stood the Temple of Athené Poliuchus, or Chalcioecus.</p>
 <p>Five distinct quarters of the city are mentioned: (1) <ref type="cross" target="crosspitane">Pităné</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Πιτάνη</foreign>), which appears to have been the <cb /> most important part of the city, and in which was situated the Agora, containing the council-house of the Senate, and the offices of the public magistrates. It was also surrounded by various temples and other public buildings. Of these, the most splendid was the Persian Stoa or portico, originally built of the spoils taken in the Persian War, and enlarged and adorned at later times. A part of the Agora was called the Chorus or dancing-place, in which the Spartan youths performed dances in honour of Apollo.</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosslimnae">Limnae</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Λίμναι</foreign>), a suburb of the city, on the banks of the Eurotas, northeast of Pitané, was originally a hollow spot covered with water.</p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crossmesoa">Mesoa</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Messoa</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Μεσόα, Μεσσόα</foreign>), also by the side of the Eurotas, southeast of the preceding, containing the Dromus and the Platanistas, which was a spot nearly surrounded with water, and so called from the plane-trees growing there.</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crosscynosura">Cynosūra</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυνόσουρα</foreign>), in the southwest of the city, and south of Pitané.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aegīdae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰγεῖδαι</foreign>), in the northwest of the city, and west of Pitané.</p>
 <p>The two principal streets of Sparta ran from the Agora to the extreme end of the city: these were, (1) Aphetae or Aphetais (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀφέται, Ἀφεταΐς</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">ὁδός</foreign>), extending in a southeasterly direction, past the temple of Dictynna and the tombs of the Eurypontidae; and</p>
 <p>(2) Skias (<foreign lang="greek">Σκιάς</foreign>), running nearly parallel to the preceding one, but farther to the east, and which derived its name from an ancient place of assembly, of a circular form, called Skias. The most important remains of ancient Sparta are the ruins of the theatre, which was near the Agora. On the topography of Sparta see a paper by N. E. Crosby in the <title>American Journal of Archaeology</title> for 1893 (pp. 335 foll.); and <bibl default="NO">Stein, <title>Topographie des alten Sparta</title> (1890)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Sparta is said to have been founded by Lacedaemon, a son of Zeus and Taÿgeté, who married Sparta, the daughter of Eurotas, and called the city after the name of his wife. His son Amyclas is said to have been the founder of Amyclae, which was for a long time a more important town than Sparta itself. In the mythical period, Argos was the chief city in Peloponnesus, and Sparta is represented as subject to it. Here reigned Menelaüs, the younger brother of Agamemnon; and by the marriage of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, with Hermioné, the daughter of Menelaüs, the two kingdoms of Argos and Sparta became united. The Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus, which, according to tradition, took place thirty years after the Trojan War, made Sparta the capital of the country. Laconica fell to the share of the two sons of Aristodemus, Eurysthenes and Procles, who took up their residence at Sparta, and ruled over the kingdom conjointly. The old inhabitants of the country maintained themselves at Amyclae, which was not conquered for a long time. After the complete subjugation of the country we find three distinct classes in the population: the Dorian conquerors, who resided in the capital, and who were called Spartiatae or Spartans (see <ref type="cross" target="crossspartiatae">Spartiatae</ref>); the Perioeci or old Achaean inhabitants, who became tributary to the Spartans, and possessed no political rights; and the Helots, who were also a portion of the old Achaean inhabitants, but were reduced to a state of slavery. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshelotae">Helotae</ref>.) From various causes the Spartans became distracted by intestine quarrels, till at length Lycurgus, who belonged to the royal family, was 
<pb n="1483" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01483">
<head orig="The Dromos at Sparta. (Restoration by Hoffmann.)">The Dromos at Sparta. (Restoration by Hoffmann.)</head>
</figure>
 selected by all parties to give a new constitution to the State. The date of Lycurgus is uncertain; but it is impossible to place it later than B.C. 825.</p>
 <p>The constitution of Lycurgus laid the foundation of Sparta's greatness; yet this constitution, traditionally ascribed to Lycurgus, is not to be regarded as wholly due to him. It represents the union of three distinct principles: the monarchical principle was represented by the kings, the aristocracy by the Senate, and the democratical element by the assembly of the people, and subsequently by their representatives, the ephors. The kings had originally to perform the common functions of the kings of the Heroic Age. They were high-priests, judges, and leaders in war; but in all of these departments they were in course of time superseded more or less. As judges they retained only a particular branch of jurisdiction, that referring to the succession of property. As military commanders they were to some extent restricted and watched by commissioners sent by the Senate; the functions of high-priest were curtailed least, perhaps because least obnoxious. In compensation for the loss of power, the kings enjoyed great honours, both during their life and after their death. The Senate (<foreign lang="greek">γερουσία</foreign>) consisted of thirty members, one from each <seg lang="la">obé</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ὠβά</foreign>), all elected except the two kings, who were <seg lang="la">ex officio</seg> members, and represented each his own <seg lang="la">obé.</seg> In their functions they replaced the old council of the nobles as a sort of privy council to the kings, but their power was greater, since the votes of the kings were of no greater weight than those of other senators; they had the right of originating and discussing all measures before they could be submitted to the decision of the popular assembly; they had, in conjunction (later) with the ephors, to watch over the due observance of the laws and institutions; and they were judges in all criminal cases, without being bound by any written code. <cb /> For all this they were not responsible, holding their office for life.</p>
 <p>But with all these powers the elders formed no real aristocracy. They were not chosen either for property qualification or for noble birth. The Senate was open to the poorest citizen, who during sixty years had been obedient to the laws and zealous in the performance of his duties. The mass of the people—that is, the Spartans of pure Doric descent (see <ref type="cross" target="crossspartiatae">Spartiatae</ref>) —formed the sovereign power of the State. The popular assembly consisted of every Spartan of thirty years of age, and of unblemished character; only those were excluded who had not the means of contributing their portion to the <hi rend="italic">syssitia</hi> (q. v.). They met at stated times to decide on all important questions brought before them, after a previous discussion in the Senate. They had no right of amendment, but only that of simple approval or rejection, which was given in the rudest form possible, by shouting. The popular assembly, however, had neither frequent nor very important occasions for directly exerting their sovereign power. Their chief activity consisted in delegating it; hence arose the importance of the ephors, who were the representatives of the popular element of the constitution. The five ephors answer in many points to the Roman tribunes of the people. Their appointment is included by Herodotus among the institutions of Lycurgus, but it is probable that Aristotle is right in dating these later, from the reign of Theopompus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossephori">Ephori</ref>.) Their appointment was perhaps a concession to the people, at first as overseers of the markets and as magistrates who might check illegal oppression by kings or great men. Subsequently they absorbed most of the power in the State. To Lycurgus was ascribed also a prohibition to use written laws, or to have any coinage but iron: but these traditions must refer to later customs, since there were neither 
<pb n="1484" /><cb />
 coins nor written laws in Greece as early as Lycurgus.</p>
 <p>With reference to their subjects, the few Spartans formed a most decided aristocracy. On the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, part of the ancient inhabitants of the country, under name of the Perioeci (<foreign lang="greek">Περίοικοι</foreign>), were allowed indeed to retain their personal liberty, but lost all civil rights, and were obliged to pay to the State a rent for the land that was left them. But a great part of the old inhabitants were reduced to a state of perfect slavery, different from that of the slaves of Athens and Rome, and more similar to the villanage of the feudal ages. These were called Helots (<foreign lang="greek">εἱλῶται</foreign>). They were allotted, with patches of land, to individual members of the ruling class. They tilled the land, and paid a fixed rent to their masters, not, as Perioeci, to the State. The Spartans formed, as it were, an army of invaders in an enemy's country; their city was a camp, and every man a soldier. At Sparta the citizen only existed for the State; he had no interest but the State's, and no property but what belonged to the State. It was a fundamental principle of the constitution that all citizens were entitled to the enjoyment of an equal portion of the common property. This was done in order to secure to the commonwealth a large number of citizens and soldiers free from labour for their sustenance, and able to devote their whole time to warlike exercises, in order thus to keep up the ascendency of Sparta over her Perioeci and Helots. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshelotae">Helotae</ref>.) The Spartans were to be warriors, and nothing but warriors. Therefore, not only all mechanical labour was thought to degrade them; not only was husbandry despised and neglected, and commerce prevented, or at least impeded, by prohibitive laws and by the use of iron money; but also the nobler arts and sciences were so effectually stifled that Sparta is a blank in the history of the arts and literature of Greece. The State took care of a Spartan from his cradle to his grave, and superintended his education in the minutest points; and this was not confined to his youth, but extended throughout his whole life. The <hi rend="italic">syssitia</hi>, or, as they were called at Sparta, <seg lang="la">phiditia</seg>, the common meals, may be regarded as an educational institution; for at these meals subjects of general interest were discussed and political questions debated. The youths and boys used to eat separately from the men, in their own divisions. See Jannet, <bibl default="NO"><title>Les Institutions Sociales et le Droit Civil à Sparte</title> (2d ed. Paris, 1880)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Sparta gradually extended her sway over the greater part of the Peloponnesus. In B.C. 743 the Spartans attacked Messenia, and after a war of twenty years subdued this country, 723. In 685 the Messenians again took up arms, but at the end of seventeen years were again completely subdued; and their country from this time forward became an integral portion of Laconia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmessenia">Messenia</ref>.) After the close of the Second Messenian War the Spartans continued their conquests in Peloponnesus. They defeated the Tegeans, and wrested the district of Thyreae from the Argives. At the time of the Persian invasion they were confessedly the first people in Greece, and to them was granted by unanimous consent the chief command in the war. But after the final defeat of the Persians the haughtiness of Pausanias disgusted most of the Greek States, particularly the Ionians, and led <cb /> them to transfer the supremacy to Athens (477). From this time the power of Athens steadily increased, and Sparta possessed little influence outside of the Peloponnesus. The Spartans, however, made several attempts to check the rising greatness of Athens, and their jealousy of the latter led at length to the Peloponnesian War (431). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspeloponnesian-war">Peloponnesian War</ref>.) This war ended in the overthrow of Athens, and the restoration of the supremacy of Sparta over the rest of Greece (404). But the Spartans did not retain this supremacy more than thirty years. Their decisive defeat by the Thebans under Epaminondas at the battle of Leuctra (371) gave the Spartan power a shock from which it never recovered; and the restoration of the Messenians to their country two years afterwards completed the humiliation of Sparta. Thrice was the Spartan territory invaded by the Thebans, and the Spartan women saw for the first time the watch-fires of an enemy's camp. The Spartans now finally lost their supremacy over Greece, but no other Greek state succeeded to their power; and about thirty years afterwards the greater part of Greece was obliged to yield to Philip of Macedon. The Spartans, however, kept aloof from the Macedonian conqueror, and refused to take part in the Asiatic expedition of his son, Alexander the Great.</p>
 <p>Under this later Macedonian king the power of Sparta declined still further. The simple institutions of Lycurgus were abandoned, and little by little luxury crept into the State. The number of citizens diminished, and the landed property became vested in a few families. Agis endeavoured to restore the ancient institutions of Lycurgus, but he perished in the attempt (240). Cleomenes III., who began to reign 236, was more successful. He succeeded in putting the ephors to death, and overthrowing the existing government (225); and he then made a redistribution of the landed property, and augmented the number of the Spartan citizens by admitting some of the Perioeci to this honour. His reforms infused new blood into the State, and for a short time he carried on war with success against the Achaeans. But Aratus, the general of the Achaeans, called in the assistance of Antigonus Doson, the king of Macedonia, who defeated Cleomenes at the decisive battle of Sellasia (221), and followed up his success by the capture of Sparta. Sparta now sank into insignificance, and was ruled by a succession of native tyrants, till at length it was compelled to abolish its peculiar institutions, and to join the <ref type="cross" target="crossachaean-league">Achaean League</ref> (q.v.). Shortly afterwards it fell, with the rest of Greece, under the Roman power.</p>

<head orig="Spartăcus">Spartacus</head>

 <p> A famous fighter, by birth a Thracian, and successively a shepherd, a soldier, and a chief of banditti. On one of his predatory expeditions he was taken prisoner, and sold to a trainer of gladiators. In B.C. 73 he was a member of the gladiatorial company of Lentulus, and was detained in his school at Capus, in readiness for the games at Rome. He persuaded his fellow-prisoners to make an attempt to gain their freedom. About seventy of them broke out of the trainingschool of Lentulus, and took refuge in the crater of Vesuvius. Spartacus was chosen leader, and was soon joined by a number of runaway slaves. These were blockaded by C. Claudius Pulcher at the head of three thousand men, but Spartacus attacked the besiegers and put them to flight. His numbers rapidly increased, and for two years (B.C. 73-71) he defeated one Roman army after another, and laid waste Italy, from the foot of the Alps to the southernmost corner of the peninsula. After both the consuls of the year 72 had been defeated by Spartacus, M. Licinius Crassus, the praetor, was appointed to the command of the war. Crassus carried on the contest with vigour and success; and, after gaining several advantages over the enemy, at length defeated them on the River Silarus in a decisive battle, in which Spartacus was slain. The character of Spartacus has been maligned by the Roman writers. Cicero compares the vilest of his contemporaries to him: Horace speaks of him ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>iii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 19" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 19</bibl>) as a common robber; none recognize his greatness, but the terror of his name survived to a late period of the Empire. Accident made Spartacus a shepherd, a freebooter, and a gladiator; nature formed him a hero. The excesses of his followers he could not always repress, and his efforts to restrain them often cost him his popularity. But he was in himself not less mild and just than he was able and valiant.

<div2 id="crossspartiatae" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Spartiātae">Spartiatae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σπαρτιάται</foreign>). In Sparta the ruling class of those who had the full rights of citizens, as distinguished from the subject Perioeci (see <ref type="cross" target="crossperioeci">Perioeci</ref>) and Helots (see <ref type="cross" target="crosshelotae">Helotae</ref>). They were the descendants of the Dorians, who had formerly conquered the land under the leadership of Aristodemus. As to the manner in which they were divided, see <ref type="cross" target="crossphyle">Phylé</ref>. Their number is said never to have exceeded 10,000, and, as they were utterly opposed to the admission of foreign elements, it was constantly decreasing. At the time of the Persian Wars it still amounted to 8000, about B.C. 320 to little more than 1000.</p>
 <p>They were called <foreign lang="greek">ὅμοιοι</foreign> (men sharing equal rights), with reference to the equality established among them by the legislation of Lycurgus, (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) in their education, which was exclusively directed towards fitting them for service in war; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) in their way of living, especially in the meals which they <cb /> had in common (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssyssitia">Syssitia</ref>); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) in their property; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) and in their political rights.</p>
 <p>To every family of Spartiatae an equal portion of land was assigned by Lycurgus, with a number of Helots who had settled upon it, who had to cultivate the property and deliver the produce to its possessor. The Spartiatae themselves were not allowed to engage in a handicraft, or in trade, or in agriculture; their whole life had to be devoted to the service of the State, and therefore they had their abode in Sparta itself. The allotted land and the Helots were accounted State property, and the possessors had no kind of right to dispose of them. Families which were dying out were preserved by adopting sons of families related to them, and similarly heiresses were married to men without inheritance of their own. If a family consisted of several male members, then the eldest was considered as head of the family, and had to support his brothers. The original equality of property came to an end, partly through the extinction of many families and the transference of their lot of ground, partly by the silent abrogation of the old law, which did not allow the Spartiatae to possess silver or gold, but chiefly after the law of Epitadeus, by which the free disposal of land was allowed, if not by sale, at least by gift during lifetime and by will. But the principle of aristocratic equality long continued in form; and only those who did not fulfil the conditions attached to the equality of rights, or who did not obey the injunctions of Lycurgus as to the education of the young, and as to the life of adult citizens, or who did not contribute to the common meals, suffered a diminution of their political rights. This involved exclusion from the government and administration of the State, as well as from the right of electing or being elected to office; but the punishment affected the individual only, and not his children, nor his position in personal law.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔνοπτρον, κάτοπτρον</foreign>). For mirrors the ancients used round or oval, also square, plates of polished metal, generally of copper, mixed with tin, zinc, and other materials, and often silvered and gilded. In later times they were also made of massive silver, the finest being the work of Praxiteles in B.C. 328. They were often provided with a decorated handle and ornamented on the back with engravings, mostly of mythological objects. To keep them bright, a sponge with powdered pumice-stone was usually fastened to them (Plato, 
<pb n="1486" /><cb /> 72 C). The best metallic mirrors were produced at Brundisium.</p>
 <p>Glass mirrors were probably known in antiquity, consisting of a glass plate covered with a thin leaf of metal at the back (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 26</bibl>).

 <p>The Etruscan mirrors are in some respects remarkably fine, the finest of all being represented below. Besides these hand-mirrors, there were also in the time of the emperors mirrors as high as a man <figure id="fig.01486">

 <p>Greek mirrors were unknown to archaeologists until 1867, when the first specimen was discovered at Corinth. In design they are even more beautiful than those of Etruria. They are of two kinds: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) disc mirrors, like the Etruscan mirrors, and generally round, consisting of a single disc with a polished convex front, to reflect the face, and a concave back, ornamented with figures traced with the engraver's burin. This variety had a handle in the form of a statuette resting on a pedestal. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Another variety (“box-mirrors”), especially frequent in Greece, consists of two metallic discs, one enclosed within the other, and sometimes held together by a hinge. The cover was externally ornamented with figures in low-relief, and was internally polished and silvered to reflect the face. The second disc, forming the body of the case, was decorated internally with figures engraved with a sharp point. In the British Museum is a mirror from Corinth, representing Pan playing at the game of “Five Stones” with a Nymph attended by Eros. There is no mention of mirrors in Homer; and the oldest Greek mirrors now extant do not antedate the sixth century B.C. See Blümner, <title>Technologie</title>, iv. pp. 192, 194, 265 foll., 403; E.

 <p>A Roman poet born at Neapolis about A.D. 61. He was the son of a distinguished grammarian, and accompanied his father to Rome, where the latter acted as the preceptor of Domitian, who held him in high honour. Under the skilful tuition of his father, the young Statius speedily rose to fame, and became peculiarly renowned for the brilliancy of his extemporaneous <cb /> effusions, so that he gained the prize three times in the Alban contests; but having, after a long career of popularity, been vanquished in the quinquennial games, he retired to Neapolis, the place of his nativity, along with his wife Claudia, whose virtues he frequently commemorates. He died about A.D. 96. His chief work is the <title>Thebaïs</title>, an heroic poem, in twelve books, on the expedition of the Seven against Thebes. On the composition of this poem Statius spent twelve years. There is also extant a collection of his miscellaneous poems (thirty-two in number, mostly in hexameters) in five books, under the title of <title>Silvae;</title> and an unfinished poem called the <title>Achilleïs.</title> Statius may justly claim the praise of standing in the foremost rank among the heroic poets of the Silver Age; and in the Middle Ages he was much read (cf.

<head orig="Statuaria Ars; Sculptūra">Statuaria Ars; Sculptura</head>

 <p> The origin of painting as an art in Greece is connected with definite historical personages; but that of sculpture is lost in the mists of legend. Its authentic history does not begin until about the year B.C. 600. It was regarded as an art imparted to men by the gods; for such is the thought expressed in the assertion that the earliest statues fell from heaven. Some early application of taste and skill to plastic art may be indicated in the mythical stories respecting the Idaei <ref type="cross" target="crossdactyli">Dactyli</ref> (q.v.) and the Telchines of Rhodes (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 7. 365" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>vii. 365</bibl>), who were reported to have worked in iron and bronze. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstelchines">Telchines</ref>.) The first artist spoken of by name, <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedalus">Daedalus</ref> (q.v.), who is mentioned as early as Homer, is merely a personification of the most ancient variety of art, that which was employed solely in the construction of wooden images of the gods. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedala">Daedala</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdokana">Dokana</ref>.) This is clearly proved by his name (=<foreign lang="greek">δαίδαλος</foreign>, “the cunning artificer”). To him were attributed a series of inventions certainly separated far from each other in respect of time and place, and embracing important steps in the development of wood-carving and in the representation of the human form. Thus he is said to have invented the saw, the axe, the plummet, the gimlet, and glue (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 198" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 198</bibl>), to have been the first to open the eyes in the statues of the gods, to separate the legs, and to give freer motion to the arms, which before had hung close to the body ( <bibl n="Diod.  4. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.iv. 76</bibl>). After him the early school of sculptors at Athens, his reputed native

 city, is sometimes called the school of Daedalus (Pausan. v. 25, 13). During a long residence in Crete he is said to have instructed the Cretans in the art of making wooden images (<foreign lang="greek">ξόανα</foreign>) of the gods (ib. viii. 53, 8).</p>

The art of working in metals must have been known early in Greece, as appears from the Homeric poems (e. g. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 468" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 468</bibl>-608). An important step in this direction was due to Glaucus of Chios, who, in the seventh century B.C., invented the soldering of iron (<foreign lang="greek">σιδήρου κόλλησις</foreign>, <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 25</bibl>; Pausan. x. 16, 1) and the softening and hardening of metal by fire and water ( <title>De Def. Or.</title> 47). The discovery of bronze-founding is attributed to Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos about 580 (Pausan. viii. 14, 8). The high antiquity of Greek sculpture in stone may be inferred from a work of the very earliest period of Greek civilization—the powerful relief of two upright lions over the gate of the castle at Mycenae. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref>, p. 1068.</p>
 <p>Sculpture in marble, as well as in gold and ivory, was much advanced by two famous pupils of Daedalus, Dipoenus and Scyllis of Crete, who were working in Argos and Sicyon about B.C. 550 (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 9</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H. N., 14</bibl>; Pausan. ii. 15, 22), and founded an influential school of art in the Peloponnesus, which included Hegylus and Theocles, Dontas and Doryclidas, Clearchus of Rhegium, Tectaeus and Angelion. Among their works are recorded not only statues of gods, but also of heroes, often united in large groups. Some conception of the artistic productions of this period may be formed from scattered monuments still extant, originating in different parts of the Greek world: e. g. the rude and more primitive metopes of Selinus in Sicily; the statues of Apollo from the island of Thera and from Tenea, near Corinth; and the reliefs on the <ref type="cross" target="crossharpy-monument">Harpy Monument</ref> (q.v.) <cb /> from the acropolis of Xanthus in Lycia. These works, in spite of their archaic stiffness, show an effort after individual and natural expression, though the position of the foot in striding, with the sole completely touching the ground, and the unemotional and stony smile on the mask-like face, are common to all. Even after Greek sculpture had mastered the representation of the human body, not only at rest, but also in the most violent movement, it still continued unable to overcome the lifeless rigidity of facial expression. This is seen in the Trojan battle-scenes (about B.C. 480) on the Aeginetan pediments. Here the figures are represented in every variety of position in the fight, and depicted, not indeed with any ideality, but with perfect mastery, even to the smallest detail; whereas the faces are entirely destitute of any expression appropriate to their situation. The athletic forms in which the Aeginetan heroes are represented indicate another important extension of the sphere of artistic representation. From about B.C. 544 it had become usual to erect statues of the victors in the athletic contests, Olympia especially abounding in these (Pausan. vi. 18, 7); the statues there mentioned are of wood. By this innovation the art was freed from the narrow limits to which it had been confined by the traditions of religion, and led on to a truer imitation of nature. In this department the school of Aegina was specially active, attaining its highest perfection in the bronze statuary of Glaucias, Callon, and, above all, Onatas (B.C. 500-460). <figure id="fig.01490.2">

 <p>Sculpture in bronze flourished simultaneously in the Peloponnesus at Sicyon under Canachus (for a supposed copy of his Apollo, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscanachus">Canachus</ref>) and his brother, Aristocles, the founder of a school which lasted long after, and at Argos under Ageladas, the teacher of Phidias, Myron, and Polyclitus. The transition to the period of the finest art is represented by Calamis of Athens, Pythagoras of Rhegium, and especially Myron, another Athenian, in whom the art attained the highest truth to nature, with perfect freedom in the representa<figure id="fig.01491">
<head orig="Central Figures of the West Gable, Aegina.">Central Figures of the West Gable, Aegina.</head>
</figure> tion of the human body, and was thus prepared for the development of ideal forms.</p>
 <p>This last step was taken at Athens, in the time of Pericles, by Phidias. In his creations, particularly in his statues of the gods, whether in bronze or in ivory and gold, he succeeded in combining perfect beauty of form with the most profound ideality, fixing forever the ideal type for Zeus and Athené, the two deities who were pre-eminently characterized by intellectual dignity. See Waldstein, <cb /> <bibl default="NO"><title>The Art of Pheidias</title> (1880)</bibl>; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossathene">Athené</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenon">Parthenon</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphidias">Phidias</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosszeus">Zeus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Of the pupils of Phidias the two who worked most nearly in the same spirit were Agoracritus and Alcamenes, the author of the sculpture of the western pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, part of which still remains. The perfection of Attic art at this time can be realized when we consider that, with all their beauty of execution, the extant marble sculptures of the Parthenon, Theseum, Erechtheum, and the Temple of Niké Apteros must be regarded as mere productions of the ordinary workshop when compared with the lost masterpieces of Phidias. The school of Phidias had rivals in the naturalistic school which followed Myron, including his son, Lycius, and Cresilas of Cydonia. Independent of both schools stood Paeonius of Mendé, whose Niké, as well as part of his sculptures on the eastern pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, is still extant (see <ref type="cross" target="crossolympia">Olympia</ref>), and Callimachus, the

</figure>
 so-called inventor of the Corinthian order of architecture (Vitruv. iv. 1, 10) and of the application of the auger to working in marble (Pausan. i. 26, 6). Another school of sculpture in opposition to that of Athens was founded at Argos by Phidias's younger contemporary, Polyclitus, whose colossal gold and ivory statue of the Argive Heré directly challenged comparison with the works of Phidias in its materials, its ideality, and its artistic form, and established the ideal type of that goddess. He mainly devoted himself, however, to work in bronze, the department in which Argos had long been pre-eminent; and made it his aim to exhibit the perfection of beauty in the youthful form. He also established a <foreign lang="greek">κανών</foreign> or scheme of the normal proportions of the body. Of his pupils the chief was Naucydes of Argos. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspolyclitus">Polyclitus</ref>.</p>
 <p>As in the first period of Greek sculpture, represented by Myron, Phidias, and Polyclitus, the schools of Athens and Argos held the first rank beyond dispute, so it was also in the second period, which embraces the fourth century down to the death of Alexander the Great. Athens, moreover, during this period remained true to the traditions of Phidias, and still occupied itself mainly with the ideal forms of gods and heroes, though in a spirit essentially altered. The more powerful emotions, the more deeply stirred passions of the period after the Peloponnesian War, were not without their influence on art. The sculptors of the time abandoned the representation of the dignified divinities of the earlier school, and turned to the <cb /> forms of those deities whose nature gave room for softer or more emotional expression, especially Aphrodité and Dionysus and the circle of gods and daemons who surrounded them. The highest aim of their art was to portray the profound pathos of the soul, to give expression to the play of the emotions. With this is connected the preference of this school for marble over bronze, as more suited for rendering the softer and finer shades of form or expression. The art of executing work in gold and ivory was almost lost, the resources of the States no longer sufficing, as a rule, for this purpose. The most eminent of the New Attic School were Scopas of Paros and Praxiteles of Athens. Scopas, also famous as an architect, was a master of the most elevated pathos. Praxiteles was no less masterly in regard to the softer graces in female or youthful forms, and in the representation of sweet moods of dreamy reverie. In his statues of Aphrodité at Cnidus and Eros at Thespiae he established ideal types for those divinities. The Hermes with the infant Dionysus, found at Olympia, remains as a memorial of his art. Of the productions of this school (in which the names of Bryaeus, Leochares, and Timotheus, who was joined with Scopas in his work on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, ought also to be mentioned) an opinion may be formed from the spirited reliefs on the Choragic Monument of <ref type="cross" target="crosslysicrates">Lysicrates</ref> (q.v.) at Athens. We have also extant, in a copy, the Niobid group (see <ref type="cross" target="crossniobe">Niobé</ref>), concerning the original of which it was much disputed, even in ancient times, whether the author were Scopas or Praxiteles (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 28</bibl>). In contrast to the ideal aims of Attic art, the Sicyonian School still remained true to its early naturalistic tendencies and to the art of sculpture in bronze, of which Argos had so long been the home. At the head of the school stood one of the most influential and prolific artists of antiquity, Lysippus of Sicyon. His efforts were directed to represent beauty and powerful development in the human body. Hence Heracles, as the impersonation of human physical strength, was portrayed by him oftener, and with more success, than any other deity, and his type fully established. Lysippus was most prolific as a portrait sculptor, a branch of art which had been much advanced in the invention by his brother Lysistratus of the method of taking plaster casts of the features (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 153" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 153</bibl>).</p>
 <p>After Alexander the Great the practice of the art, which had thus developed to perfect mastery of technique, began to deteriorate with the general decay of the countries of Greece proper, and to give place to the flourishing artistic schools of Asia Minor and the neighbouring islands. The characteristic of this period is the rise of a method of treatment which strives after effect. Instead of the simplicity of earlier times we get a certain deliberate calculation of a theatrical type, a tendency to make the exhibition of technical skill an end in itself. The most productive school was that of Rhodes, at the head of which stood a pupil of Lysippus, Chares of Lindus, who designed the famous Colossus of Rhodes, the largest statue of ancient times. Two well-known extant works in marble proceeded from this school, the group of <ref type="cross" target="crosslaocoon">Laocoön</ref> (q.v.) and his sons, by Agesander, Athenodorus, and Polydorus, found at Rome in 1506, now one of the chief treasures of the Vatican Museum, and the Farnese Bull at Naples. This last group, by 
<pb n="1493" /><cb /> Apollonius and Tauriscus of Tralles, represents the revenge of Zethus and Amphion on Dircé (see illustration, p. 86), and is the largest extant antique work which consists of a single block of marble. Both these are admirable in skill and technique, embodying with the greatest vividness the wild passions of a moment of horror; but the theatrical effect and the exhibition of technical skill are unduly exaggerated. To the Rhodian School is conjecturally assigned the fine group representing Menelaüs bearing the body of Patroclus, several <figure id="fig.01493">
<head orig="Hermes of Praxiteles. (From the Heraeum at Olympia.)">Hermes of Praxiteles. (From the Heraeum at Olympia.)</head>
</figure> imperfect copies of which are still extant. It is sometimes, however, regarded as one of the later products of the same school as the group of Niobé, and assigned to the early part of the third century B.C.</p>
 <p>The second in rank of the schools of this period was that at Pergamum, where the sculptors Isogonus, Phyromachus, Stratonicus, and Antigonus celebrated in a series of bronze statues the victories of the kings Eumenes I. (263-241) and Attalus I. (241-197) over the Gauls. There are still extant, at Venice, Rome, and Naples, single figures from a magnificent offering of Attalus, which stood on the Acropolis at Athens, and consisted of groups of figures illustrating the conflict between the gods and the Giants, the battle of the Athenians and Amazons, the fight at Marathon, and the destruction of the Gauls by Attalus. Other masterpieces of the school are the work popularly called the “Dying Gladiator,” now identified as a Gallic warrior, who has just stabbed himself after a defeat, and the group in the Villa Ludovisi, called “Paetus and Arria,” which really represents a Gaul killing his wife and himself. But the most brilliant proof of their powers is furnished by the reliefs of the battle of the Giants from the acropolis at Pergamum. <cb /> <figure id="fig.01493.2">

(See <ref type="cross" target="crosspergamene-sculptures">Pergamene Sculptures</ref>.) To this period may also be referred with certainty the original of the celebrated Belvedere Apollo, which probably had reference to the rescue of the Temple of Delphi from the Gallic army in B.C. 280, which was supposed to be the work of the god (see illustration, p. 99).</p>

 <p>The artistic activity of the kingdom of the Seleucidae in Syria is represented by Eutychides, a pupil of Lysippus, and his famous “Tyché,” a work in bronze representing the presiding destiny of the city of Antioch on the Orontes (Pausan. vi. 2, 6).</p>
 <p>After the subjugation of Greece by the Romans in the middle of the second century, Rome became the headquarters of Greek artists, whose work, though without novelty in invention, had many excellences, especially in perfect mastery of technique. Of the artists of the first century B.C. and the early imperial times the following are worthy of mention: Apollonius of Athens (Belvedere torso of Hercules at Rome), Glycon (Farnese Hercules at Naples [see illustration, p. 793]), and Cleomenes (the “Venus de' Medici” at Florence [see p. 367]), though the works of all these are more or less free reproductions of the creations of earlier masters; also Agasias of Ephesus, sculptor of the so-called “Borghese Gladiator” (really an athlete) in the Louvre at Paris, a very fine work in the spirit of the Pergamene School. (See illustration, p. 734.)</p>
 <p>In the same period Pasiteles, an Italian Greek of great versatility, attempted a regeneration of art on the basis of careful study of nature and of earlier productions. This movement in favour of an academic eclecticism was continued by Pasiteles' pupil, Stephanus, who has left us a youthful figure (in the Villa Albani), and Stephanus's pupil, Menelaüs, the artist of the fine group called “Orestes and Electra.” There was a revival of Greek art in the first half of the second century A.D. under Hadrian, when a new ideal type of youthful beauty was created in the numerous representations of the imperial favourite Antinoüs.</p>
 <p>The artistic work of the Romans before the introduction of Greek culture was under Etruscan influence. The art of that people was chiefly displayed in pottery and the closely connected craft 
<pb n="1494" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01494">

</figure>
 of bronze-founding, which they developed with great technical skill and for which they had a special predilection. They not only filled their towns with quantities of bronze statues, Volsinii alone containing about 2000 at the time of its conquest by the Romans in B.C. 265 (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 34</bibl>), but provided Rome also for a long time with works of the kind. Judging from the extant monuments, such as the “Mars of Todi” in the Vatican, the “Boy with a Goose under his Arm” at Leyden, and the “Robed Statue of Aulus Metellus” at Florence, the character of their art seems wanting in freedom of treatment and in genuine inspiration. After the conquest of Greece, Greek art took the place of Etruscan at Rome; and, thanks to the continually increasing love of magnificence among the Romans, which was not content with the adornment of public buildings and squares, but sought artistic decoration for private dwellings, a great activity in art was developed, whereof numberless extant works give evidence. Besides the Greek influence, to <cb /> which we owe many copies of the masterpieces of Greek art gradually accumulated in Rome, a peculiarly Roman art arose. This was especially active in portrait sculpture.</p>
 <p>Portrait statues were divided, according as they were in civil or military costume, into <seg lang="la">togatae</seg> and <seg lang="la">loricatae</seg> or <seg lang="la">thoracatae </seg> (<seg lang="la">lorica</seg>=<foreign lang="greek">θώραξ</foreign>, a coat of mail). To these were added in later times the socalled <title>Achilleae</title>, idealized in costume and pose (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 8</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 118" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H. N., 118</bibl>). It was customary to depict emperors in the form of Iupiter or other gods, and their wives with the attributes of Iuno or Venus. Of the innumerable monuments of this description special mention is due to the statue of Augustus in the Vatican (see illustration, p. 170); the marble equestrian statues of Balbus and his son at Naples, found at Herculaneum; the bronze equestrian statue of M. Aurelius on the square of the Capitol at Rome; the seated statues of Agrippina the Elder in the Capitoline Museum, and the younger Agrippina at Naples.</p>
 <p>Hand in hand with portrait sculpture went the art of historical reliefs. In accordance with the realistic spirit of Rome, as opposed to the Greek custom of idealizing persons and events, this department strove to secure the greatest possible accuracy and truth. The most important works of the kind are the reliefs on the Arch of Titus; those on the Arch of Constantine, taken from the Arch of Trajan (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarcus-triumphalis">Arcus Triumphalis</ref>); and those on the columns of Trajan and M. Aurelius. <figure id="fig.01494.2">
<head orig="Marble Equestrian Statue of the Younger Balbus. (Naples Museum.)">Marble Equestrian Statue of the Younger Balbus. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="1495" /><cb /> (See illustration under <ref type="cross" target="crossarchitectura">Architectura</ref>.) Roman historical sculpture is seen already on its decline in the reliefs of the Arch of Septimius Severus (A.D. 203), and the decline is complete in those of the Arch of Constantine. A subordinate branch of relief sculpture was employed on the <seg lang="la">sarcophagi</seg> common from the second century A.D. The subjects of these reliefs are rarely taken from events in the man's actual life; they are most usually scenes from legends of Greek gods or heroes, often after compositions of an earlier period, and accordingly showing a Greek character in their treatment.</p>
 <p>White marble was the material chiefly employed in statuary: in the earlier times of Greek art, the local kinds, in Attica particularly the Pentelic, which is “fine in grain and of a pure white.” From the fourth century on that of Paros was preferred. This is a very beautiful marble, though of a strongly crystalline grain; it is slightly translucent. It was used in Roman times in preference to the similar marble of Luna (Carrara), a “marble of many qualities, from the purest white and a fine sparkling grain, like loaf-sugar, to the coarser sorts disfigured with bluish-gray streaks.” It was sometimes used for columns in Rome. The marble of Hymettus “appears to have been the first foreign marble introduced into Rome. It resembles the inferior kind of Luna marble, being rather coarse in grain and frequently stained with gray striations.” Coloured marble first became popular under the emperors— e. g. black for Egyptian subjects (statues of Isis), red for Dionysus, Satyrs, and others in his train. To the same period belongs the use of striped and spotted kinds of marble, coloured alabaster, porphyry, and granite. Different colours of stone were also combined—e. g. the drapery of black marble or porphyry.</p>
 <p>A noteworthy peculiarity of ancient sculpture, as also of architecture, is the habit of embellishing all kinds of marble work by the application of colours (Polychromy), which is known from references in ancient writers. Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 420" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>420</bibl>C) speaks of “painting statues.” Plutarch (<title>De Gloria Athen.</title> 348 F) mentions “dyers” of statues side by side with gilders and encaustic painters. Lastly, Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 133" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 133</bibl>) states that Praxiteles owned he was much indebted to the <seg lang="la">circumlitio</seg>, or touchingup, of his works by the painter Nicias. It is also attested by traces still present on many works. Thus the statues at Pompeii, especially those of late date, are in many cases coloured, especially certain parts of the drapery. A painting found at Pompeii introduces us into the studio of a female artist engaged in embellishing with paint a terminal statue of Hermes. The original sketch in colours lies on the ground, and she is pausing to examine her work, which is also watched with interest by two bystanders. Wood and pottery were always painted. Even sculptures intended for the adornment of buildings—e. g. metopes and friezes—not only had painted backgrounds (generally blue or red), but were themselves richly adorned with colouring. It is also held that originally even the bare parts of stone figures were <cb /> painted; afterwards a coating of wax was thought enough (Vitruv. vii. 9). In particular statues, many artists coloured only the characteristic parts, fringes of garments, sandals, armour, weapons, snoods or head wrappings, and of the parts of the body, the lips, eyes, hair, beard, and nipples. Probably the cheeks, too, received a light reddish tinge; but all was done with discretion. The colours chiefly used were red, blue, and yellow, or gilding. The employment of different materials for the extremities and for the drapery also produced the effect of colouring. Similarly metal<figure id="fig.01495">
<head orig="Relief from Column of Trajan.">Relief from Column of Trajan.</head>
</figure> sculpture secured variety of colour by the application of gold, silver, and copper to the bronze. The sparkle of the eyes was often represented by inlaid precious stones or enamel. Particular parts in marble statues, such as attributes, weapons, implements, were also made of metal. There are examples of this in the pediments of Aegina and in the frieze of the Parthenon. Under the Empire metal was sometimes used for the drapery. Thus the Braschi Antinoüs in the Vatican was formerly draped in bronze.

<head orig="Stephănus">Stephanus</head>

 <p> the Latinized form of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Estienne</hi>, in English sometimes absurdly called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Stephens</hi>. The name of a celebrated family of printers, publishers, and classical scholars (descended from a noble Provençal family), found settled at Paris towards 1500 in the person of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Henry</hi>, who is supposed to have been born about 1470, and died in 1520. In Paris Henry carried on the business of printer and bookseller for upwards of twenty years. In 1526 <hi rend="SmallCaps">Robert</hi>, his second son, born 1503, is found in possession of the business. Every year of Robert's life is marked by the issue from his printing-press of several volumes, many of them masterpieces of art, and all of them surpassing anything of the kind previously seen in France. He was at once printer, publisher, commentator, and author. In 1532 he published a Latin dictionary (<title>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</title>) which for two centuries remained the standard work. He also published editions of several classical authors and numerous Latin grammars. His Bible of 1545, and his Greek Testament of 1549, each drew down upon him a religious prosecution; and though the prosecutions failed legally, they were disastrous to his private fortune. Having first sent his family to Geneva, he followed them there in 1549. Robert, his second son, shortly afterwards returned to Paris, where he resumed his father's business.</p>
 <p>The second <hi rend="SmallCaps">Henry</hi>, born at Paris in 1528, succeeded his father, Robert, on his death in 1559. Though Henry possessed the same literary industry and ability as his father, he was unfortunately deficient in his father's practical turn of mind. Devoted to his art and to his calling, he seems to have been utterly wanting in worldly prudence. In two years we find that he had revised and published more than 4000 pages of Greek text, including some twenty <seg lang="la">editiones principes;</seg> while at the same time he was writing his <bibl default="NO"><title>Apologia pro Herodoto</title> (1566)</bibl>—a work of formidable length and learning. Rendered nervous and irritable by an overworked brain, and by pecuniary difficulties, travelling, originally undertaken from literary curiosity, grew into a necessity of his life, and he visited England, the Netherlands, and Italy, examining classical manuscripts and making the acquaintance of distinguished scholars. In 1572 appeared his great Greek lexicon (<title>Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</title>), in five folio volumes, on which he spent nearly his whole fortune (last reprint by Didot, 9 vols. [Paris, 1831- 65]). In 1578 he visited Paris, where for several years he became a hanger-on of the court of Henry III., who bestowed upon him a pension, which the state of the royal exchequer rendered merely nominal. Quitting Paris, he wandered in poverty over Europe, his own family often ignorant of where he was to be found. He died at Lyons in 1598. Great as a publisher and commentator, Henry Estienne does not seem to have possessed much power as an original thinker, but his mastery of Greek seems to have been almost complete, and as a critic of the French language he is still esteemed in France. The traditions of the family were kept up by <hi rend="SmallCaps">Paul</hi> <bibl default="NO">(1566-1627)</bibl> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Antoine</hi> <bibl default="NO">(1592-1674)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossstephanus2" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Stephănus">Stephanus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Στέφανος</foreign>). (1) An Athenian comic poet of the New Comedy, probably the son of Antiphanes, some of whose plays he is said to have exhibited.</p>
 <p>(2) Of Byzantium, the author of the geographical lexicon entitled <title>Ethnica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐθνικά</foreign>), of which unfortunately we only possess an epitome. Stephanus was a grammarian at Constantinople, and lived after the time of Arcadius and Honorius, and before that of Justinian II. His work was reduced to an epitome by a certain Hermolaüs, who dedicated his abridgment to the emperor Justinian II. According to the title, the chief object of the work was to specify the gentile names derived from the several names of places and countries in the ancient world. But, while this is done in every article, the amount of information given went far beyond this. Nearly every article in the epitome contains a reference to some ancient writer, as an authority for the name of the place; but in the original, as we see from the extant fragments, there were considerable quotations from the ancient authors, besides a number of very interesting particulars, topographical, historical, mythological, and others. Thus the work was not merely what it professed to be, a lexicon of a special branch of technical grammar, but a valuable dictionary of geography. How great would have been its value to us, if it had come down to us unmutilated, may be seen by any one who compares the extant fragments of the original with the corresponding articles in the epitome. These fragments, however, are unfortunately very scanty. The best editions of the epitome of Stephanus are by Dindorf, 4 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1825)</bibl>; Westermann <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1839)</bibl>; and Meineke <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1849)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossstesichorus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Stesichŏrus">Stesichorus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Στησίχορος</foreign>). A celebrated Greek poet of Himera in Sicily, contemporary with Sappho, Alcaeus, Pittacus, and Phalaris. He is said to have been born B.C. 632, to have flourished about 608, and to have died in 552 at the age of eighty. Of the events of his life we have only a few obscure accounts. As with other great poets, his birth is fabled to have been attended by an omen; a nightingale sat upon the babe's lips, and sang a sweet strain. He is said to have been carefully educated at Catana, and afterwards to have enjoyed the friendship of Phalaris, the tyrant of Agrigentum. Many writers relate the fable of his being miraculously struck with blindness after writing an attack upon Helen, and recovering his sight when he had composed a Palinodia or recantation. He is said to have been buried at Catana by a gate of the city, which was called after him the Stesichorean Gate. Stesichorus was one of the nine-chiefs of lyric poetry recognized by the ancients. He stands, with Alcman, at the head of one branch of the lyric art, the choral poetry of the Dorians. He was the first to break the monotony of the strophe and antistrophe by the introduction 
<pb n="1498" /><cb /> of the epode, and his metres were much more varied, and the structure of his strophes more elaborate, than those of Alcman. His odes contained all the essential elements of the perfect choral poetry of Pindar and the tragedians. The subjects of his poems were chiefly heroic; and he transferred the subjects of the old epic poetry to the lyric form, dropping, of course, the continuous narrative, and dwelling on isolated adventures of his heroes. He also composed poems on other subjects, and fables, among the latter the wellknown one of the horse, the stag, and the man ( <bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 2. 20" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title>ii. 20</bibl>). His extant remains may be classified under the following heads: (1) mythical poems;</p>
 <p>(2) hymns, encomia, epithalamia, paeans;</p>
 <p>(3) erotic poems, and scolia;</p>
 <p>(4) a pastoral poem, entitled <title>Daphnis;</title></p>
 <p>(5) fables;</p>
 <p>(6) elegies. The dialect of Stesichorus was Dorian, with an intermixture of the epic. The best editions of his fragments are those by Kleine <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1828)</bibl>, and by Bergk in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Poetae Lyrici Graeci</title> (4th ed. 1878)</bibl>.

 <p> (from <hi rend="italic">stips</hi> and <seg lang="la">pendo</seg>). The pay of a Roman soldier. Originally each tribe had to contribute the necessary means to provide for its contingent. 
<pb n="1499" /><cb /> It was only at the beginning of the war against Veii in B.C. 404 that payment of a sum by the State was introduced. This was given to the soldiers, either before or after the campaign, as compensation for the cost of their living during its continuance. When this had gradually become a regular payment, it grew customary, in making it, to deduct everything which the State had provided for the army in the way of clothing, arms, and food; but under the Empire maintenance was given free. In the time of Polybius the pay of legionaries was 120 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($20); of centurions twice, and of knights three times that amount. Caesar increased it to 225 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($37.50) for a legionary, Domitian to 300 ($50). The praetorians received under Tiberius 720 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($120).

 <p><title>Stipendium</title> is also the name of the fixed normal tax imposed on conquered provinces, which might consist of money, or produce, or both (see <ref type="cross" target="crossprovincia">Provincia</ref>). During the Republic, when a country was conquered, this was usually fixed according to the amount of the existing taxes, and the country divided into fiscal districts, and the officials of the chief places in each compelled to pay in the portion which fell to them. Under Augustus the taxes were for the first time fixed upon the basis of a measurement of the ground occupied, and of a computation of property (<seg lang="la">census</seg>). The stipendium was either a ground-tax (<seg lang="la">tributum soli</seg>) or a personal tax (<seg lang="la">tributum capitis</seg>), which was partly a poll-tax, partly a property-tax, partly a tax on the trade carried on by the individual. In exceptional cases special taxes were also imposed. Those bound to pay the <seg lang="la">stipendium</seg> were called <seg lang="la">stipendiarii.</seg></p>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossioannes">Ioannes</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ιωάννης ὁ Στοβαῖος</foreign>). A Greek writer of uncertain date (probably about A.D. 500), who derived his surname apparently from being a native of Stobi in Macedonia. Of his personal history we know nothing. Stobaeus was a man of extensive reading, in the course of which he noted down the most interesting passages; and to him we are indebted for a large proportion of the fragments that remain of the lost works of the early Greek poets and prose-writers to the number of 500. His work, which was a sort of anthology, was originally a single one, but in course of time was divided into two, each having two subdivisions—<title>Eclogae Physicae et Ethicae</title>, which is edited by Gaisford <bibl default="NO">(1850)</bibl> and Meineke <bibl default="NO">(1860-64)</bibl>; and the <title>Anthologion</title> or <title>Florilegium</title>, edited by Gaisford <bibl default="NO">(1822-25)</bibl>, Meineke <bibl default="NO">(1856-57)</bibl>, and Wachsmuth and Hense, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1884-94)</bibl>.

The Stoic teaching was one of stern morality, the principle being “a life in accordance with nature and controlled by virtue.” It was an ascetic system, teaching perfect indifference (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπάθεια</foreign>) to everything external, for nothing external could be either good or evil. Hence to the Stoics both pain and pleasure, poverty and riches, sickness and health, were supposed to be equally unimportant (see <ref type="cross" target="crossstoa">Stoa</ref>).

<head orig="Strabo">Strabo</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Στράβων</foreign>). A celebrated geographer, a native of Amasia in Pontus. The date of his birth is unknown, but may perhaps be placed about B.C. 63. He lived during the whole of the reign of Augustus, and during the early part, at least, of the reign of Tiberius. He is supposed to have died after A.D. 21. He received a careful education. He studied grammar under Aristodemus at Nysa in Caria, and philosophy under Xenarchus of Seleucia in Cilicia and Boethus of Sidon. He lived some years at Rome, and also travelled much in various countries. We learn from his own work that he was with his friend Ælius Gallus in Egypt in B.C. 24. He wrote an historical work (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱστορικὰ Ὑπομνήματα</foreign>) in forty-three books, which is lost. It began where the history of Polybius ended, and was probably continued to the battle of Actium. He also wrote the work on Geography (<foreign lang="greek">Γεωγραφικά</foreign>), in seventeen books, which has come down to us entire, with the exception of the seventh, of which we have only a meagre epitome.</p>
 <p>Strabo's work, according to his own expression, was not intended for the use of all persons. It was designed for all who had had a good education, and particularly for those who were engaged in the higher departments of administration. Consistently with this view, his plan does not comprehend minute description, except when the place or the object is of great interest or importance; nor is his description limited to the physical characteristics of each country; it comprehends the important political events of which each country has been the theatre, a notice of the chief cities and the great men who made them illustrious; in short, whatever was most characteristic and interesting in every country. His work forms a striking contrast with the geography of Ptolemy, and the dry list of names, occasionally relieved by something added to them, in the geographical portion of the <title>Historia Naturalis</title> of Pliny. It is, in short, a book intended for reading, and it may be read; a kind of historical geography. Strabo's language is generally clear, except in very technical passages and in those where the text has been corrupted; it is appropriate to the matter, simple, and without affectation. The first two books of Strabo are an introduction to his Geography, and <cb /> contain his views on the form and magnitude of the earth, and other subjects connected with mathematical geography. In the third book he begins his description: he devotes eight books to Europe, six to Asia, and the seventeenth and last to Egypt and Libya.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> appeared at Venice in 1516. The best editions of Strabo are by Casaubon <bibl default="NO">(Geneva, 1587)</bibl>, reprinted by Falconer <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1807)</bibl>; by Koray <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1815)</bibl>; by Kramer, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1844-52)</bibl>; by Müller and Dübner <bibl default="NO">(1853-56)</bibl>; and by Meineke <bibl default="NO">(1866-77)</bibl>. There is a fine translation into French in 5 vols. made by command of Napoleon I. <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1805-19)</bibl>, with valuable notes. An English version is that of Hamilton and Falconer, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1854-57)</bibl>. Tozer's English edition of selections from Strabo <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1893)</bibl> has an excellent introduction.

When the tyrants of the Ionic cities in Asia Minor were deposed by Aristagoras, he established <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign> in their places as chief magistrates. At Athens they were instituted by Clisthenes when he remodelled the constitution (see <ref type="cross" target="crossclisthenes">Clisthenes</ref>), and they assumed the duties previously discharged by the king or the Archon Polemarchus. They were ten in number, and were chosen by the vote (<foreign lang="greek">χειροτονία</foreign>) of the people, one from each tribe. Before entering on their duties they passed an examination (<foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασία</foreign>) as to their character; and no one was eligible for the office unless he had legitimate children and landed property in Attica. They had command of military expeditions and in general the direction of all that related to the conduct of wars, including the equipment of the forces. In levying the troops they were aided by the taxiarchs. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstaxiarchi">Taxiarchi</ref>.) They even collected the taxes levied for 
<pb n="1501" /><cb />
 warlike purposes and managed the funds set apart for such objects. In lawsuits arising from these questions the strategi presided. They appointed each year the persons who were to serve as trierarchs (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstrierarchia">Trierarchia</ref>); and in cases of emergency they could summon special assemblies of the whole people. In the field it was usual for only three of them to be sent out at one time, but at Marathon all ten of them held command in turn. With them was associated the Archon Polemarchus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarchon">Archon</ref>), and in the council of war his vote was equal to that of any of the strategi.</p>
 <p>The name <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign> was also given to the chief of the Achaean League (see <ref type="cross" target="crossachaean-league">Achaean League</ref>), and to those of the Aetolian League (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaetolicum-foedus">Aetolicum Foedus</ref>).</p>

The strenae consisted of branches of bay and of palm, sweetmeats made of honey, and figs or dates, as a good omen that the year might bring only joy and happiness (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, i. 185- 190).

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>. A Roman historian and scholar, who was born about the beginning of the reign of Vespasian, and practised as an advocate at Rome in the reign of Trajan. He lived on intimate terms with the younger Pliny , several of whose letters are addressed to him. At the request of Pliny , Trajan granted to Suetonius the <seg lang="la">ius trium liberorum;</seg> for, though he was married, he had not three children, which number was necessary to relieve him from various legal disabilities. Suetonius was afterwards appointed private secretary (<seg lang="la">magister epistolarum</seg>) to Hadrian, but was deprived of this office by the emperor, along with Septicius Clarus, the praefect of the Praetorians, on the ground of his offensive familiarity with Sabina, the emperor's wife. His chief work is his lives of the first twelve emperors of Rome (<title>Vitae Duodecim Caesarum</title>) from Iulius to Domitian. Suetonius does not follow the chronological order in his <title>Lives</title>, but groups together his facts according to their nature. His language is very brief and precise, sometimes obscure, without any affectation of ornament; and his works abound in scandalous anecdotes. The existing treatise <title>De Illustribus Grammaticis et de Claris Rhetoribus</title> is perhaps only part of a larger work, the <title>Pratum</title>, which seems to have been a sort of encyclopaedia, as many fragments show, dealing with a great number of subjects. (See Schanz, <title>Röm. Litt.</title> iii. 42-54.) The only other productions of Suetonius still extant are a few lives of Roman authors.</p>
 <p>The standard text of Suetonius is that of Roth <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1886)</bibl>, and of the fragments that of Reifferscheid <bibl default="NO">(2d ed. Leipzig, 1890)</bibl>.

 <head><surname full="yes">Sulla</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Cornelius</foreName>
 <p>The name of a patrician family; in many very old-fashioned texts incorrectly written <hi rend="bold">Sylla.</hi> This family was originally called Rufinus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossrufinus">Rufinus</ref>), and the first member of it who obtained the name of Sulla was P. Cornelius Sulla, mentioned below (No. 1). The origin of the name is uncertain.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius</hi>, great-grandfather of the dictator Sulla , and grandson of P. Cornelius Rufinus, who was twice consul in the Samnite Wars. His father is not mentioned. He was Flamen Dialis, and likewise Praetor Urbanus and Praetor Peregrinus in B.C. 212, when he presided over the first celebration of the Ludi Apollinares.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossfelix">Felix</ref>, the dictator, was born in B.C. 138. Although his father left him only a small property, his means were sufficient to secure for him a good education. He studied Greek and Roman literature with diligence and success, and appears early to have imbibed that love for literature and art by which he was distinguished throughout life. At the same time he prosecuted pleasure with equal ardour, and his youth as well as his manhood was disgraced by the most sensual vices. Still his love of pleasure did not absorb all his time, nor did it emasculate his mind; for no Roman during the latter days of the Republic, with the exception of Iulius Caesar, had a clearer judgment, a keener discrimination of character, or a firmer will. The slender property of Sulla was increased by the liberality of his step-mother and of a courtesan named Nicopolis, both of whom left him all their fortune. His means, though still scanty for a Roman noble, now enabled him to aspire to the honours of the State. He was quaestor in 107, when he served under Marius in Africa. Hitherto he had only been known for his profligacy; but he displayed both zeal and ability in the discharge of his duties, and soon gained the approbation of his commander and the affections of the soldiers. It was to Sulla that Iugurtha was delivered by Bocchus; and the quaestor thus shared with the consul the glory of bringing this war to a conclusion. Sulla himself was so proud of his share in the success that he had a seal ring engraved, representing the surrender of Iugurtha, which he continued to wear till the day of his death. Sulla continued to serve under Marius with great distinction in the campaigns against the Cimbri and Teutones; but Marius becoming jealous of the rising fame of his officer, Sulla left Marius in 102, and took a command under the colleague of Marius, Q. Catulus, <cb /> who intrusted the chief management of the war to Sulla. Sulla now returned to Rome, where he appears to have lived quietly for some years. He was praetor in 93, and in the following year (92) was sent as propraetor into Cilicia, with special orders from the Senate to restore Ariobarzanes to his kingdom of Cappadocia, from which he had been expelled by Mithridates. Sulla met with complete success. He defeated Gordius, the general of Mithridates, in Cappadocia, and placed Ariobarzanes on the throne.</p>
 <p>The enmity between Marius and Sulla now assumed a more deadly form. Sulla 's ability and increasing reputation had already led the aristocratic party to look up to him as one of their leaders; and thus political animosity was added to private hatred. In addition to this, Marius and Sulla were both anxious to obtain the command of the impending war against Mithridates; and the success which attended Sulla 's recent operations in the East had increased his popularity, and pointed him out as the most suitable person for this important command. About this time Bocchus erected in the Capitol gilded figures, representing the surrender of Iugurtha to Sulla , at which Marius was so enraged that he could scarcely be prevented from removing them by force. The exasperation of both parties became so violent that they nearly had recourse to arms against each other; but the breaking out of the Social War hushed all private quarrels for the time. Marius and Sulla both took an active part in the war against the common foe. But Marius was now advanced in years; and he had the deep mortification of finding that his achievements were thrown into the shade by the superior energy of his rival. Sulla gained some brilliant victories over the enemy, and took Bovianum, the chief town of the Samnites. He was elected consul for 88, and received from the Senate the command of the Mithridatic War. The events which followed--his expulsion from Rome by Marius, his return to the city at the head of his legions, and the proscription of Marius and his leading adherents--are related in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmarius">Marius</ref>.</p>
 <p> Sulla remained at Rome till the end of the year, and set out for Greece at the beginning of 87, in order to carry on the war against Mithridates. He landed at Dyrrhachium, and forthwith marched against Athens, which had become the headquarters of the Mithridatic cause in Greece. After a long and obstinate siege, Athens was taken by storm on the first of March in 86, and was given up to rapine and plunder. Sulla then marched against Archelaüs, the general of Mithridates, whom he defeated in the neighbourhood of Chaeronea in Boeotia; and in the following year he again gained a decisive victory over the same general near Orchomenus. But while Sulla was carrying on the war with such success in Greece, his enemies had obtained the upper hand in Italy. The consul Cinna , who had been driven out of Rome by his colleague Octavius soon after Sulla 's departure from Italy, had entered it again with Marius at the close of the year. Both Cinna and Marius were appointed consuls 86, and all the regulations of Sulla were swept away. Sulla , however, would not return to Italy till he had brought the war against Mithridates to a conclusion. After driving the generals of Mithridates out of Greece, Sulla crossed the Hellespont, and early in 
<pb n="1505" /><cb /> 84 concluded a peace with the king of Pontus. He now turned his arms against Fimbria, who had been appointed by the Marian party as his successor in the command. But the troops of Fimbria deserted their general, who put an end to his own life.</p>
 <p> Sulla now prepared to return to Italy. After leaving his legate, L. Licinius Murena, in com<figure id="fig.01505">
<head orig="Sulla. (Bust in the Capitoline Museum.)">Sulla. (Bust in the Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> mand of the province of Asia, with two legions, he set sail with his own army to Athens. While preparing for his deadly struggle in Italy, he did not lose his interest in literature. He carried with him from Athens to Rome the valuablelibrary of Apellicon of Teos, which contained most of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapellicon">Apellicon</ref>.) He landed at Brundisium in the spring of 83. The Marian party far outnumbered him in troops, and had every prospect of victory. By bribery and promises, however, Sulla gained over a large number of the Marian soldiers, and he persuaded many of the Italian towns to espouse his cause. In the field his efforts were crowned with equal success; and he was ably supported by several of the Roman nobles, who espoused his cause in different parts of Italy. Of these one of the most distinguished was the young Cn. Pompey, who was at the time only twenty-three years of age. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspompeius">Pompeius</ref>, No. 10.) In the following year (82) the struggle was brought to a close by the decisive battle gained by Sulla over the Samnites and Lucanians under Pontius Telesinus before the Colline Gate of Rome. This victory was followed by the surrender of Praenesté and the death of the younger Marius, who had taken refuge in this town.</p>
 <p> Sulla was now master of Rome and Italy; and he resolved to take the most ample vengeance upon his enemies, and to extirpate the popular party. One of his first acts was to draw up a list of his enemies who were to be put to death, called a <seg lang="la">proscriptio.</seg> It was the first instance of the kind in Roman history. All persons in this list were outlaws who might be killed by any one with impunity, even by slaves; their property was confiscated to the State, and was to be sold by public auction; their children and grandchildren lost their votes in the Comitia, and were excluded from all public offices. Further, all who killed a proscribed person received two talents as a reward, and whoever sheltered such a person was punished with death. Terror now reigned not only at Rome, but throughout Italy. <cb /> Fresh lists of the proscribed constantly appeared. No one was safe; for Sulla gratified his friends by placing in the fatal lists their personal enemies, or persons whose property was coveted by his adherents. The confiscated property, it is true, belonged to the State, and had to be sold by public auction; but the friends and dependants of Sulla purchased it at a nominal price, as no one dared to bid against them. The number of persons who perished by the proscriptions is stated differently, but it appears to have amounted to many thousands. At the commencement of these horrors Sulla had been appointed dictator for as long a time as he judged it to be necessary. This was towards the close of 81. Sulla 's chief object in being invested with the dictatorship was to carry into execution, in a legal manner, the great changes which he meditated in the constitution and the administration of justice. He had no intention of abolishing the Republic; and, consequently, he caused consuls to be elected for the following year, and was elected to the office himself in 80, while he continued to hold the dictatorship. The general object of Sulla 's reforms was to restore, as far as possible, the ancient Roman constitution, and to give back to the Senate and the aristocracy the power which they had lost. Thus he deprived the tribunes of the plebs of all real power, and abolished altogether the legislative and judicial functions of the Comitia Tributa. At the beginning of 81 he celebrated a splendid triumph on account of his victory over Mithridates. In a speech which he delivered to the people at the close of the ceremony, he claimed for himself the surname of <title>Felix</title>, as he attributed his success in life to the favour of the gods. In order to strengthen his power, Sulla established military colonies throughout Italy. The inhabitants of the Italian towns which had fought against Sulla were deprived of the full Roman franchise, and were only allowed to retain the <seg lang="la">commercium:</seg> their land was confiscated and given to the soldiers who had fought under him. Twenty-three legions, or, according to another statement, forty-seven legions, received grants of land in various parts of Italy. A great number of these colonies was settled in Etruria, the population of which was thus almost entirely changed. These colonies had the strongest interest in upholding the institutions of Sulla , since any attempt to invalidate the latter would have endangered their newly acquired possessions. Sulla likewise created at Rome a kind of body-guard for his protection by giving the citizenship to a great number of slaves who had belonged to persons proscribed by him. The slaves thus rewarded are said to have been as many as ten thousand, and were called Cornelii after him as their patron.</p>
 <p>After holding the dictatorship till the beginning of 79, Sulla resigned this office, to the surprise of all classes. He retired to his estate at Puteoli, and there, surrounded by the beauties of nature and art, he passed the remainder of his life in those literary and sensual enjoyments in which he had always taken so much pleasure. His dissolute mode of life hastened his death, but the immediate cause was the rupture of a blood-vessel; though some time before he had been suffering from the disgusting disease which is known in modern times by the name of <seg lang="la">morbus pediculosus</seg>, or phthiriasis. 
<pb n="1506" /><cb /> He died in 78, in the sixtieth year of his age. He was honoured with a public funeral, and a monument was erected to him in the Campus Martius, the inscription on which had been composed by himself. It stated that none of his friends ever did him a kindness, and none of his enemies a wrong, without being fully repaid. Sulla was married five times: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) To Ilia or Iulia, who bore him a daughter, married to Q. Pompeius Rufus, the son of Sulla 's colleague in the consulship in 88; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) to Aelia; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) to Caelia; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) to Caecilia Metella, who bore him a son, who died before Sulla , and likewise twins, a son and a daughter; (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) to Valeria, who bore him a daughter after his death.</p>
 <p> Sulla wrote a history of his own life and times, called <title>Memorabilia</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑπομνήματα</foreign>). It was dedicated to L. Lucullus, and extended to twentytwo books, the last of which was finished by Sulla a few days before his death. He also wrote Fabulae Atellanae, and the Greek Anthology contains a short epigram which is ascribed to him. See <bibl default="NO">Gerlach, <title>Marius und Sulla</title> (1856)</bibl>; and Beesly, <bibl default="NO"><title>The Gracchi, Marius, and Sulla</title> (New York, 1878)</bibl>.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Faustus</hi>, son of the dictator by his fourth wife, Caecilia Metella, and a twin brother of Fausta, was born not long before B.C. 88, the year in which his father obtained the first consulship. He and his sister received the names of Faustus and Fausta respectively on account of the good fortune of their father. At the death of his father in 78 Faustus and his sister were left under the guardianship of L. Lucullus. Faustus accompanied Pompey into Asia, and was the first who mounted the walls of the Temple of Jerusalem in 63. In 60 he exhibited the gladiatorial games which his father, in his last will, had enjoined upon him. In 54 he was quaestor. In 52 he received from the Senate the commission to rebuild the Curia Hostilia, which had been burned down in the tumults following the murder of Clodius, and which was henceforward called the Curia Cornelia, in honour of Faustus and his father. He married Pompey's daughter, and sided with his father-in-law in the Civil War. He was present at the battle of Pharsalia, and subsequently joined the leaders of his party in Africa. After the battle of Thapsus in 46 he attempted to escape into Mauretania, but was taken prisoner by P. Sittius, and carried to Caesar. Upon his arrival in Caesar's camp he was murdered by the soldiers in a tumult. Faustus seems to have resembled his father only in his extravagance, for we know from Cicero that he was overwhelmed with debt at the breaking out of the Civil War.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius</hi>, nephew of the dictator, elected consul along with P. Autronius Paetus for the year B.C. 65; but neither he nor his colleague entered upon the office, as they were accused of bribery by L. Torquatus the younger, and were condemned. It was currently believed that Sulla was privy to both of Catiline's conspiracies, and he was accordingly charged with this crime by his former accuser, L. Torquatus, and by C. Cornelius. He was defended by Hortensius and Cicero, and the speech of the latter on his behalf is still extant. He was acquitted; but, independent of the testimony of Sallust ( <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>17</bibl>), his guilt may almost be inferred from the embarrassment of his advocate. In the Civil War, Sulla espoused Caesar's cause. He served under him as legate in Greece, and commanded with Caesar himself the right wing at the battle of Pharsalia (48). He died in 45. <cb />
 </p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Servius</hi>, brother of the preceding, took part in both of Catiline's conspiracies. His guilt was so evident that no one was willing to defend him; but we do not read that he was put to death along with the other conspirators (Sall. <bibl n="Sal.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius</hi>, one of the most distinguished orators of his time, born B.C. 124. He commenced public life as a supporter of the aristocratic party, and acquired great influence in the State by his splendid talents, while he was still young. In 93 he was quaestor, and in 89 he served as legate of the consul Cn. Pompeius Strabo in the Marsic War. In 88, he was elected to the tribunate; but he deserted the aristocratic party, and joined Marius. The causes of this sudden change are not expressly stated; but we are told that he was overwhelmed with debt; and there can be little doubt that he was bought by Marius. When Sulla marched upon Rome at the head of his army, Marius and Sulpicius took to flight. Marius succeeded in making his escape to Africa, but Sulpicius was discovered in a villa, and put to death.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius</hi>, probably son or grandson of the last, was one of Caesar's legates in Gaul and in

He first devoted himself to oratory, and he studied this art with Cicero in his youth. He afterwards studied law; and he became one of the best jurists as well as most eloquent orators of his age. He was quaestor of the district of Ostia in B.C. 74; curule aedile, 69; praetor, 65; and consul 51 with M. Claudius Marcellus. He appears to have espoused Caesar's side in the Civil War, and was appointed by Caesar proconsul of Achaia (46 or 45). He died in 43 in the camp of M. Antony, having been sent by the Senate on a mission to Antony, who was besieging Dec. Brutus in Mutina. Sulpicius wrote a great number of legal works. He is often cited by the jurists whose writings are excerpted in the Digest; but there is no excerpt directly from him in the Digest. He had numerous pupils, the most distinguished of whom were Ofilius and Alfenus Varus. There are extant in the collection of Cicero's Epistles (<title>Ad Fam.</title> iv.) two letters from Sulpicius to Cicero, one of which is the well-known letter of consolation on the death of Tullia, the daughter of the orator. The same book contains several letters from Cicero to Sulpicius. He is also said to have written some erotic poetry. Sulpicius left a son Servius, who is frequently mentioned in Caesar's correspondence.

<div2 id="crosssumptuariae-leges" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Sumptuariae Leges">Sumptuariae Leges</head>

 <p> Laws intended to limit and control the expenditure of the individual citizen.</p>
 <p>The sumptuary legislation of <ref type="cross" target="crossgreece">Greece</ref> was contained for the most part in the codes of the great lawgivers. A <seg lang="la">rhetra</seg> of Lycurgus is said to have forbidden the Spartans to have their houses made by any more elaborate implements than the axe and the saw; simplicity of food and clothing was enjoined on the male members of the population; iron money was originally the only coinage in use ( <title>Apophth. Lac. Lys.</title> 3), and private possession of gold and silver was forbidden even after these metals were employed for public purposes ( <bibl n="Plut. Lys. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Lys.</title>17</bibl>). By the laws of Zaleucus of Locri, we are told, the citizens of that State were forbidden to drink undiluted wine, except on the order of a physician, under pain of death (Athen. p. 429); while simplicity of dress and a limitation of the <cb /> number of personal attendants were also enjoined. The Solonian legislation at Athens contained enactments against expensive feminine apparel and ornaments, particularly those given in the dowry (<foreign lang="greek">φερνή</foreign>) of a bride, and against expensive funerals; there were also laws in force at Athens which limited the number of guests at entertainments (Athen. p. 245). Funeral regulations similar to those of Solon, we are told by Plutarch, existed in his native town of Chaeronea ( <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>21</bibl>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi> sumptuary legislation was progressive; it did not originate until a comparatively late period in the history of the State, and each law aimed at eradicating some definite and growing evil. The inefficiency of these laws and the extreme difficulty of enforcing them are amply attested ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 2. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>ii. 55</bibl>; <bibl n="Gel.  2.24.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.ii.24.3</bibl>; Tertull. <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>6</bibl>), but, even when recognized, were not sufficient to check further attempts in this direction. The fact that most of these laws dealt with the same subject--namely, the expenses of the table--and enjoined very similar restrictions, shows how quickly each of them must have sunk into desuetude.</p>
 <p>The earliest sumptuary regulations were those contained in the Twelve Tables limiting the expenses of funerals ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23). They were possibly copied from the similar regulations of Solon.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Oppia</hi>, passed in B.C. 215, provided that no woman should possess more than half an ounce of gold, or wear a dress of different colours, or ride in a carriage in the city or within a mile of it except during public religious ceremonies. This law, which was dictated by the necessities of the Second Punic War, was repealed twenty years later, in B.C. 195 (<bibl n="Liv.  34. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiv. 1</bibl>-8).</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Orchia</hi>, passed three years after Cato 's censorship, and therefore in B.C. 181, was the first law that restricted the expenses of the table. It prescribed a limit to the number of guests that might be invited to entertainments. Cato is said to have opposed its introduction.</p>
 <p>Next followed the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Fannia</hi>, whose date is fixed by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 10. 71" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>x. 71</bibl>) as B.C. 161. It grew out of a <hi rend="italic">senatusconsultum</hi>, which enjoined that the <seg lang="la">principes civitatis</seg> should swear before the consuls that they would not exceed a certain limit of expense in the banquets given at the Ludi Megalenses. Afterwards a consular law was promulgated, which went further than the Lex Orchia, in that it prescribed the nature and value of the eatables which were allowed to be consumed. It permitted the expenditure of 100 <seg lang="la">asses</seg> on the Ludi Romani, the Ludi Plebeii, and the Saturnalia, and of thirty on some other festival occasions; but on all other days of the year it allowed only ten <seg lang="la">asses</seg> to be spent. It further forbade the serving of any fowl but a single hen, and that not fattened. One of its clauses was of a protective character, since it enjoined that only native wines should be consumed ( <bibl n="Gel.  2. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.ii. 24</bibl>; Macrob. iii. 17;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 10.  71" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>x. 71</bibl>; Tertull. <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 6." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>vi.</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Didia</hi> was passed eighteen years later, in B.C. 143. It was practically a re-enactment of the Lex Fannia.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Licinia</hi>, of uncertain date, marks the next attempt at sumptuary legislation. It allowed 100 <seg lang="la">asses</seg> to be spent on the table on certain days, 200 on marriage feasts, and on certain other festivals (such as the Kalends, Nones, and Nundinae) 
<pb n="1508" /><cb />
 thirty <seg lang="la">asses;</seg> it fixed a limit to the amount of meat and fish that was to be consumed on ordinary days, and encouraged the consumption of gardenproduce.</p>
 <p>The general neglect of the preceding laws caused the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Leges Corneliae</hi> of the dictator Sulla to be passed in B.C. 81, restricting the expenses on sepulchral monuments, and regulating the cost of funerals, which he himself violated on the death of his wife Metella ( <title>Sulla</title>, 35). Another law restricted the luxury of the table, allowing thirty sesterces to be spent on the Kalends, Ides, Nones, the <seg lang="la">dies ludorum</seg>, and certain <seg lang="la">feriae</seg>, and three on all other days.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">A Lex Aemilia</hi>, which probably belongs to B.C. 78, did not fix a fresh limit to expenses, but laid down regulations as to the kinds and quantities of food.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lex Antia</hi>, which was subsequent to the last-named law but cannot be dated precisely, besides limiting the expenditure on banquets, also limited the class of persons with whom a magistrate might dine out during his time of office.</p>
 <p>Next came the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Leges Iuliae</hi>. The dictator Caesar enforced the former sumptuary laws respecting entertainments, which had fallen into disuse (Dio Cass. xliii. 25). They were not attended to during his absence, but during his presence in Rome the enforcement of them was rigorous; guards were placed round the market to seize forbidden luxuries, and sometimes dishes were taken from the tables of private individuals ( <title>Iul.</title> 43). He also passed a law prohibiting the use of litters, of purple garments, and of pearls, except in the case of persons of a certain rank or age, or on certain days ( Suet. l. c.).</p>
 <p>The emperor Augustus, in B.C. 22, passed laws regulating the expenses to be incurred on ordinary and festal days ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>34</bibl>). On the former an expenditure of 200 sesterces was permitted, on the latter an expenditure of 300, and on marriage festivals of 1000 sesterces; an edict of Augustus or Tiberius allowed expenses on various festivals to range from 300 to 2000 sesterces, the increase in the permitted expenditure being allowed in the hope that this concession would secure obedience to the law.</p>

To his reign also belongs a <hi rend="italic">senatusconsultum</hi> prohibiting the use of gold plate except in sacred rites, and preventing men from wearing silk. Further sumptuary regulations checking the expenditure on food were made by Nero; among later emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius regulated the expenses of gladiatorial shows; and the emperor Tacitus again prohibited men from wearing silk, and forbade the wearing of gold-embroidered garments. It was during the later Republic and the early Empire that luxury especially flourished, although the studied simplicity of the courts of Augustus and Tiberius must have had some influence in restraining it. After Galba, began a new era of moderation, an effect which Tacitus traces to the decline of private fortunes, to the dangers attending the display of wealth, to the introduction of <seg lang="la">novi homines</seg> into the Senate and into the best society of Rome, but principally to the influence of Vespasian, a prince <seg lang="la">antiquo cultu victuque</seg> <cb /> ( <bibl n="Tac.

 <p> The Roman fast day, or day of humiliation, celebrated originally in times of great distress, after the Sibylline Books had been duly consulted. The whole population, both of the towns and surrounding country, free-born and emancipated, men, women, and children, took part in the solemnity. The whole ceremony had a 
<pb n="1509" /><cb /> Greek rather than a Roman colour. From the Temple of Apollo, priests and laymen, crowned with wreaths of bay, marched in procession to the sound of singing and the notes of the lyre, visiting all the holy places, especially those where <seg lang="la">lectisternia</seg> were held. According to the rite introduced from the Oriental Greeks of Asia Minor, the Romans touched with their faces the threshold of the sanctuaries, prostrated themselves before the statues of the gods, clasping their knees and kissing their hands and feet. While the prayers were being said, incense and wine were offered, the prayers being rehearsed by the members of the <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> intrusted with the care of the Sibylline Books (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibyllae</ref>), and the performance of the holy rites prescribed by them. On such days the temples ordinarily closed to the public, or only accessible under certain restrictions, were, so far as practicable, thrown open to all. The thanksgivings decreed by the Senate after great victories were celebrated in a similar manner. These originally lasted only one day, but in the course of time were lengthened (e. g. for Pompey's victory over Mithridates, one of ten days; for Caesar's conquest of the Belgae, one of fifteen days; and for his defeat of Vercingetorix, one of twenty days), until, at the end of the Republic, they sometimes extended over forty or fifty days, and were often united with a public feasting of the people.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Σοῦσα</foreign>; Old Test. Shushan; ShusPers. ). The winter residence of the Persian kings. It stood in the district Cissia of the province Susiana, on the eastern bank of the river Choaspes. Its name in old Persian signifies “Lily,” and that flower is said to abound in the plain in which the city stood. Susa was of a quadrangular form, 120 <cb /> (or, according to others, 200) stadia in circuit, and without fortifications; but it had a strongly fortified citadel, containing the palace and treasury of the Persian kings. The Greek name of this citadel, Memnonicé or Memnonium, is perhaps a corruption of the Aramaic <title>Maaninon</title>, “a fortress;” and this easy confusion of terms gave rise to the fable that the city was founded by Tithonus, the father of Memnon. An historical tradition ascribes its erection to Darius, the son of Hystaspes, but it existed already in the time of Daniel (Dan. viii. 2). There is, however, a difficulty as to the identification of the Shushan of Daniel with the Susa of the Greeks. The climate of Susa was very hot, and hence the choice of it for the winter palace. It was here that Alexander and his generals celebrated their marriage with the Persian princesses in B.C. 325, but the city declined after Babylon became the capital of Alexander and his successors. In B.C. 315 it was taken by Antiochus, who found in it a vast amount of treasure. The site of Susa is now marked by extensive mounds, on which are found fragments of bricks and broken pottery, with cuneiform inscriptions. The ruins of the ancient city cover a space of nearly three square miles, and they have been carefully explored by Loftus, Churchill, Dieulafoy, and others. The principal remains that still exist are four vast platforms like those at <ref type="cross" target="crosspersepolis">Persepolis</ref> (q.v.), with traces of a gigantic colonnade with a frontage of over 340 feet and a depth of 240 feet. The palace of Darius Hystaspis has also been excavated, and from it many artistic treasures taken to the Louvre.

 <p>(2) A celebrated Greek town in Lucania, situated between the rivers Sybaris and Crathis, at a short distance from the Tarentine Gulf, and near the confines of Bruttium. It was founded B.C. 720 by Achaeans and Troezenians, and soon attained an extraordinary degree of prosperity and wealth. Its inhabitants became so notorious for their love of luxury and pleasure that their name was employed to indicate any voluptuary. At the time of their highest prosperity their city was fifty stadia, or upwards of six miles, in circumference, and they exercised dominion over twenty-five towns, so that we are told they were able to bring into the field 300,000 men, a number, however, which appears incredible. But their prosperity was of short duration. The Achaeans having expelled the Troezenian part of the population, the latter took refuge at the neighbouring city of Croton, the inhabitants of which espoused their cause. In the war which ensued between the two States, the Sybarites were completely conquered by the Crotoniates, who followed up their victory by the capture of Sybaris, which they destroyed by turning the waters of the river Crathis against the town (B.C. 510) ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 44</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod.  12. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xii. 9</bibl>; Athen. p. 521).

Each of the ten <hi rend="italic">phylae</hi> appointed 120 of its wealthier citizens, and these were divided into two symmoriae of sixty members each, so that the number of members in the twenty symmoriae amounted to 1200 (called <foreign lang="greek">συμμορίται</foreign>). Out of each of the twenty symmoriae, fifteen of the wealthier citizens were chosen, making 300 in all, whose duty it was to pay the taxes in advance on behalf of the rest. This sum had to be refunded to them by the rest in conjunction with the poorer taxable citizens, who were likewise apportioned off to various symmoriae, but without becoming actual members of them, and were drawn upon by the real <hi rend="italic">symmoritae</hi> to an extent proportional to their means.</p>
 <p>(2) After 358, this method was applied to the duty of equipping the war vessels, known as the <hi rend="italic">trierarchia.</hi> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>.) Each of the twenty symmoriae had a certain number of ships assigned to it; the real <hi rend="italic">symmoritae</hi> (not including the poorer citizens) divided the expense among themselves, and a varying number (at the most sixteen) of the richest had to raise the money advanced for a ship. To manage its affairs, each symmoria had its superintendents, curators, and assessors. The magisterial control was in both cases in the hands of the <seg lang="la">strategi</seg>, being connected with the military supplies. Though, by arrangement, the raising of taxes and fitting out of the ships were accelerated, yet it was open to abuse if the <hi rend="italic">symmoritae</hi> unduly burdened the poor by an unjust distribution. In the disputes which thus arose, the decision rested with the <seg lang="la">strategi.</seg> If any one thought that another ought to have been taxed instead of himself, he could avail himself of <hi rend="italic">antidosis</hi> (q. v.). Even the <seg lang="la">metoeci</seg>, who (like the citizens) had to pay war taxes, were divided into symmoriae. Aristotle (<title>Athen. Pol.</title> 61) describes one of the <seg lang="la">strategi</seg> as individually responsible for superintending the symmoriae for building triremes.

<div2 id="crosssymposium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Symposium">Symposium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">συμπόσιον</foreign>). A Greek term for a drinking-party. The symposium must be distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">deipnon</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>); for though drinking almost always followed a dinner-party yet the former was regarded as entirely distinct from the latter, was regulated by different customs, and frequently received the addition of many guests who were not present at the dinner. For the Greeks did not usually drink at their dinner, and it was not till the conclusion of the meal that wine was introduced. Symposia were very frequent at Athens. Their enjoyment was heightened by agreeable conversation, by the introduction of music and dancing, and by games and amusements of various kinds; sometimes, too, philosophical subjects were discussed at them. The <title>Symposia</title> of Plato and Xenophon give us a lively idea of such entertainments at Athens. The name itself shows that the enjoyment of drinking was the main object of the symposia: wine from the juice of the grape (<foreign lang="greek">οἶνος ἀμπέλινος</foreign>) was the only drink partaken of by the Greeks, with the exception of water. The wine was almost invariably mixed with water, and to drink it unmixed (<foreign lang="greek">ἄκρατον</foreign>) was considered a characteristic of barbarians. The mixture was made in a large vessel called the <hi rend="italic">crater</hi> (q. v.), from which it was <figure id="fig.01511">
<head orig="Symposium. (From the painting by Alma-Tadema.)">Symposium. (From the painting by Alma-Tadema.)</head>
</figure> conveyed into the drinking-cups. The guests at a symposium reclined on couches, and were crowned with garlands of flowers. A master of the revels (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων τῆς πόσεως, συμποσίαρχος</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεύς</foreign>) was usually chosen to conduct the symposium, whose commands the whole company had to obey, and who regulated the whole order of the entertainment and proposed the amusements. The same practice prevailed among the Romans, and their symposiarch was called <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, or <seg lang="la">rex convivii</seg>, or <seg lang="la">arbiter bibendi.</seg> The choice was generally determined by the throwing of <seg lang="la">astragali</seg> or <seg lang="la">tali.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstalus">Talus</ref>.) The proportion in which the wine and water were mixed was fixed by him, and also how much each of the company was to drink, for it was not usually left to the option of each person present to drink as much or as little as he pleased. The cups were always carried around from right to left (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ δεξιά</foreign>), and the same order was observed in the conversation and in everything that took place in the entertainment. The company frequently drank to the health of one another (<foreign lang="greek">προπίνειν</foreign>, <seg lang="la">propinare</seg>), and each did it especially to the 
<pb n="1512" /><cb />
 one to whom he handed the same cup. Respecting the games and amusements by which the symposia were enlivened, it is unnecessary to say much here, as most of them are described in separate articles in this work. Enigmas or riddles (<foreign lang="greek">αἰνίγματα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">γρῖφοι</foreign>) were among the most usual and favourite modes of diversion. Each of the company proposed one in turn to his right-hand neighbour; if he solved it, he was rewarded with a crown, a garland, a cake, or something of a similar kind, and sometimes with a kiss; if he failed, he had to drink a cup of unmixed wine, or of wine mixed with salt water, at one draught. The <seg lang="la">cottabos</seg> was also another favourite game at symposia, and was played at in various ways. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscottabus">Cottabus</ref>.) Representations of symposia are very common on ancient vases. Two guests usually reclined on each couch (<foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>), as is explained under <ref type="cross" target="crosscena">Cena</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstriclinium">Triclinium;</ref> but sometimes there were five persons on one couch. A drinking-party among the Romans was sometimes called <seg lang="la">convivium</seg>, but the word <seg lang="la">comissatio</seg> (cognate with <foreign lang="greek">κωμάζω</foreign>) more nearly corresponds to the Greek symposium. The Romans, however, usually drank during their dinner (<seg lang="la">cena</seg>), which they frequently prolonged during many hours, in the later times of the Republic and under the Empire. Their customs connected with drinking differed little from those of the Greeks, and have been incidentally noticed above.</p>

<head orig="Synesius">Synesius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Συνέσιος</foreign>). A native of Cyrené. He was one of the most remarkable of the literary men of the fifth century. He was born A.D. 378, of a distinguished family, and studied at Alexandria under Hypatia and other celebrated instructors. So rapid was the progress he made, that, at the age of nineteen years, he was chosen by the inhabitants of Cyrené to present to the Emperor Arcadius a golden crown which had been voted him. The oration which he delivered on this occasion, and which is still preserved, has been much admired. At this period he was still a pagan; subsequently, however, he was persuaded by Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, to embrace Christianity. He was for a long time, however, very unsettled in his theological notions, and it was this very uncertainty which induced him for a considerable time to withstand the solicitations of Theophilus and not accept a bishopric. He yielded, however, in A.D. 410, and, separating from a wife for whom he cherished a deep affection, he was consecrated bishop of Ptolemaïs in Cyrenaïca. He died about 430. The works of Synesius are rather philosophical and literary than theological. They are written with elegance. When the subject admits, his diction is elevated, and sometimes even sublime. He possesses the art of rendering abstract subjects agreeable, by intermingling with them mythological and historical or else poetical passages. His letters, which are 154 in number, afford varied, amusing, and instructive reading. His hymns, in iambics of four or five feet, present a singular mixture of poetic images, Christian truths, and Platonic reveries, for it was to the school of Plato that he always continued to be more or less attached. The most complete edition of his works is that of Petau or Petavius <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1612; reprinted 1631-40)</bibl>, with additions by Morel.

<head orig="Fountain of Arethusa at Syracuse. (From a photograph.)">Fountain of Arethusa at Syracuse. (From a photograph.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> the lake or marsh called Syraco (<foreign lang="greek">Συρακώ</foreign>), from which it derived its name. It was founded B.C. 734, one year after the foundation of Naxos, by a colony of Corinthians and other Dorians, led by Archias the Corinthian. The town was originally confined to the island Ortygia lying immediately off the coast; but it afterwards spread over the neighbouring mainland, and at the time of its greatest extension under the elder Dionysius it consisted of five distinct towns, each surrounded by separate walls. Some writers indeed describe Syracuse as consisting of four towns, but this simply arises from the fact that Epipolae was frequently not reckoned a portion of the city. These five towns were: (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossortygia">Ortygia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀρτυγία</foreign>), frequently called simply the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Island</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Νᾶσος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Νῆσος</foreign>), an island of an oblong shape, about two miles in circumference, lying between the Great Harbour on the west and the Little Harbour on the east. It was, as has been already remarked, the portion of the city first built, and it contained the citadel or Acropolis, surrounded by double walls, which Timoleon caused to be destroyed. In this island also was the celebrated fountain of Arethusa. It was originally separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, which was subsequently filled up by a causeway; but this causeway must at a still later time have been swept away, since we find in the Roman period that the island was connected with the mainland by means of a bridge.</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossachradina">Achradīna</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχραδίνη</foreign>) occupied originally the high ground of the peninsula north of Ortygia, and was surrounded on the north and east by the sea. The lower ground between Achradina and Ortygia was at first not included in the fortifications of either, but was 
<pb n="1514" /><cb />
 employed partly for religious processions and partly for the burial of the dead. At the time of the siege of Syracuse by the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War (415), the city censisted only of the two parts already mentioned, Ortygia forming the inner and Achradina the outer city, but separated, as explained above, by the low ground between the two.</p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crosstyche">Tyché</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Τύχη</foreign>), named after the temple of Tyché or Fortune, and situated northwest of Achradina, in the direction of the port called Trogilus.

 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossneapolis">Neapŏlis</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Νέα πόλις</foreign>), nearly southwest of Achradina, was also, at the time of the Athenian siege of Syracuse, merely a suburb, and called <ref type="cross" target="crosstemenites">Temenītes</ref>, from having within it the statue and consecrated ground of Apollo Temenites. Neapolis contained the chief <figure id="fig.01514">
<head orig="Plan of Ancient Syracuse. (After Freeman.)">Plan of Ancient Syracuse. (After Freeman.)</head>
</figure> theatre of Syracuse, which was the largest in all Sicily, and many temples.</p>
 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossepipolae">Epipŏlae</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ Ἐπιπολαί</foreign>), a space of ground rising above the three quarters of Achradina, Tyché, and Neapolis, which gradually diminished in breadth as it rose higher, until it ended in a small conical mound. This rising ground was surrounded with strong walls by the elder Dionysius, and was thus included in Syracuse, which now became one of the most strongly fortified cities of the ancient world. The highest point of Epipolae was called Euryēlus (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐρύηλος</foreign>), on which stood the fort Labdalum (<foreign lang="greek">Λάβδαλον</foreign>). After Epipolae had been added to the city, the circumference of Syracuse was one hundred and eighty stadia, or upward of twenty-two English miles; and the entire population of the city is supposed to have amounted to five hundred thousand souls at the time of its greatest prosperity. <cb /></p>
 <p>Syracuse had two harbours. The Great Harbour, still called Porto Maggiore, is a splendid bay about five miles in circumference, formed by the island Ortygia and the promontory Plemmyrium. The Small Harbour, also called Laccius (<foreign lang="greek">Λάκκιος</foreign>), lying between Ortygia and Achradina, was capacious enough to receive a large fleet of ships of war. There were several stone quarries (<seg lang="la">lautumiae</seg>) in Syracuse, which are frequently mentioned by ancient writers, and in which the unfortunate Athenian prisoners were confined. These quarries were partly in Achradina, on the descent from the higher ground to the lower level towards Ortygia, and partly in Neapolis, under the southern cliff of Epipolae. From these was taken the stone of which the city was built (Thucyd. vii. 86). The so-called “Ear of Dionysius,” in which the tyrant was supposed to overhear the conversation of his captives, is probably an invention of a mediaeval writer. The city was supplied with water from an aqueduct, which was constructed by Gelon and improved by Hieron. It was brought through Epipolae and Neapolis to Achradina and Ortygia. The modern city of Syracuse is confined to the island. The remaining quarters of the ancient city are now uninhabited, and their position marked only by a few ruins. Of these the most important are the remains of the great theatre, and of an amphitheatre of the Roman period. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The government of Syracuse was originally an aristocracy; and the political power was in the hands of the landed proprietors, called Geomori or Gamori. In course of time the people, having increased in numbers and wealth, expelled the Geomori and established a democracy. But this form of government did not last long. Gelon espoused the cause of the aristocratic party, and proceeded to restore them by force of arms; but on his approach the people opened the gates to him, and he was acknowledged without opposition tyrant or sovereign of Syracuse, B.C. 485. Under his rule and that of his brother Hieron, Syracuse was raised to an unexampled degree of wealth and prosperity. Hieron died in 467, and was succeeded by his brother Thrasybulus; but the rapacity and cruelty of the latter soon provoked a revolt among his subjects, which led to his deposition and the establishment of a democratic form of government. The next most important event in the history of Syracuse was the siege of the city by the Athenians, which ended in the total destruction of the great Athenian armament in 413. This affair, known in history as the Sicilian Expedition, was the turning 
<pb n="1515" /><cb />
 point in the <ref type="cross" target="crosspeloponnesian-war">Peloponnesian War</ref> (q.v.).

The arrival of Gylippus, the Spartan general, turned the tide. The Syracusans defeated the Athenians, annihilated the invading army, and took Nicias and his later colleague Demosthenes prisoners. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgylippus">Gylippus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The democracy continued to exist in Syracuse till B.C. 406, when the elder Dionysius made himself tyrant of the city. After a long and prosperous reign, he was succeeded in 367 by his son, the younger Dionysius, who was finally expelled by Timoleon in 343. A republican form of government was again established; but it did not last long; and in 317 Syracuse fell under the sway of Agathocles. This tyrant died in 289; and the city being distracted by factions, the Syracusans voluntarily conferred the supreme power upon Hieron II., with the title of king, in 270. Hieron cultivated friendly relations with the Romans; but on his death in 216, at the advanced age of ninetytwo, his grandson Hieronymus, who succeeded him, espoused the side of the Carthaginians. A Roman army under Marcellus was sent against Syracuse; and after a siege of two years, during which Archimedes assisted his fellow-citizens by the construction of various engines of war (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarchimedes">Archimedes</ref>), the city was taken by Marcellus in 212. From this time Syracuse became a town of the Roman province of Sicily.

<head orig="Syria">Syria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Συρία</foreign>, in Aramaean Surja; now Soristan, EshArab. -Sham, i. e. “the land on the left,” Syria), a country of western Asia, lying along the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, between Asia Minor and Egypt. In a wider sense the word was used for the whole tract of country bounded by the Tigris on the east, the mountains of Armenia and Cilicia on the north, the Mediterranean on the west, and the Arabian Desert on the south; the whole of which was peopled by the Aramaean branch of the great Semitic (or SyroArabian) race, and is included in the Old Testament under the name of Aram. The people were of the same races, and those of the north of the Taurus in Cappadocia and Pontus are called White Syrians (<foreign lang="greek">Λευκόσυροι</foreign>), in contradistinction to the people of darker complexion in Syria Proper, who are sometimes even called Black Syrians (<foreign lang="greek">Σύροι μέλανες</foreign>). Even when the name of Syria is used in its ordinary narrower sense, it is often confounded with Assyria, which only differs from Syria by having the definite article prefixed. Again, in the narrower sense of the name, Syria still includes two districts which are often considered as not belonging to it, namely, <ref type="cross" target="crossphoenice">Phoenīcé</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosspalaestina">Palaestīna</ref>, and a third which is likewise often considered separate, namely, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Coele-syria;</hi> <cb /> but this last is generally reckoned a part of Syria. In this narrower sense, then, Syria was bounded on the west (beginning from the south) by Mount Hermon, at the southern end of Antilibanus, which separated it from Palestine, by the range of Libanus, dividing it from Phoenicé, by the Mediterranean, and by Mount Amanus, which divided it from Cilicia; on the north (where it bordered on Cappadocia) by the main chain of Mount Taurus, and striking the Euphrates just below Iuliopolis, and considerably above Samosata; hence the Euphrates forms the eastern boundary. the western part of the country was intersected by a series of mountains, running south from the Taurus, under the names of Amanus, Pieria, Casius, Bargylus, and Libanus and Antilibanus; and the northern part, between the Amanus and the Euphrates, was also mountainous. The chief river of Syria was the Orontes, and the smaller rivers Chalus and Chrysorrhoas were also of importance. The valleys among the mountains were fertile, especially in the northern part; even the east, which is now merged in the great desert of Arabia, appears to have had more numerous and more extensive spaces capable of cultivation, and supported great cities, the ruins of which now stand in the midst of sandy wastes.</p>
 <p>In the earliest historical period Syria contained a number of independent kingdoms, of which Damascus was the most powerful. These were subdued by David , but became again independent at the end of Solomon's reign; from which time we find the kings of Damascus sometimes at war with the kings of Israel, and sometimes in alliance with them against the kings of Judah, till the reign of Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, who, having been invited by Ahaz, king of Judah, to assist him against the united forces of Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, took Damascus, and probably conquered all Syria, about B.C. 740. Having been a part successively of the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Macedonian Empires, it fell, after the battle of Ipsus (B.C. 301), to the share of Seleucus Nicator, and formed a part of the great kingdom of the Seleucidae, whose history is given <figure id="fig.01515">

In this partition, however, Coelesyria and Palestine went, not to Syria, but to Egypt, and the possession of those provinces became the great source of contention between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. By the irruptions of the Parthians on the east, and the unsuccessful war of Antiochus the Great with the Romans on the west, the GreekSyrian kingdom was reduced to the limits of Syria itself, and became weaker and weaker, until it was overthrown by Tigranes, king of Armenia, B.C. 79. Soon afterwards, when the Romans had conquered Tigranes as well as Mithridates, Syria was quietly added by Pompey to the empire of the Republic, and was constituted a province B.C. 54; but its northern district, <ref type="cross" target="crosscommagene">Commagēné</ref>, was not included in this arrangement. As the eastern province of the Roman Empire, and with its great desert frontier, Syria was constantly exposed to the irruptions of the Parthians, and, after them, of the Persians; but it long remained one of the most flourishing of the provinces. The attempt of Zenobia to make it the seat of empire is noticed under <ref type="cross" target="crosszenobia">Zenobia</ref>. While the Roman emperors defended this precious possession against the attacks of the Persian kings with various success, a new danger arose, as early as the fourth century, from the Arabians of the Desert, who began to be known under the name of Saracens; and, when the rise of Mohammed had given to the Arabs that great religious impulse which revolutionized the Eastern world, Syria was the first great conquest that they made from the Eastern Empire, A.D. 632-638. In the time immediately succeeding the Macedonian conquest, Syria was regarded as consisting of two parts—the north, including the whole country down to the beginning of the Lebanon range, and the south, consisting of Coelesyria in its more extended sense. The former, which was called Syria Proper, or Upper Syria (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἄνω Συρία</foreign>, Syria Superior), was divided into four districts or tetrarchies, which were named after their respective capitals, Seleucis, Antiochené, Laodicené, and Apamené.</p>
 <p>The Roman province of <ref type="cross" target="crosssyria">Syria</ref>, as originally constituted by Pompey in B.C. 64, was by no means a single homogeneous region. Owing to the different nationalities and interests which Syria properly so called comprised, it was at first parcelled out between the Roman jurisdiction and a number of independent territories which were allowed to remain within it. Under the Roman proconsul of Syria were at first Upper Syria (with the chief towns Antioch, Seleucia, Apamea, Laodicea, Cyrrhus, Hieropolis, and Beroea), and the land of Phoenicia, including Tripolis, Byblus, Tyre, and Sidon; but Iudea was left for a time nominally independent, except for a short time when Gabinius broke it up into five districts. Caesar made Iudea a client State under its own princes, and it did not become a Roman province (of the second rank, under a procurator) until A.D. 6. Similarly Commagené was left under its own princes until A.D. 17, and again from 38 till 72, when it was finally joined to the province of Syria; Chalcis retained its own princes till 92, when Domitian added it to the province; Abilené till 49; Arethusa and Emesa till 78; Damascus was not included in the province of Syria till 106. The province of Syria under the Empire was governed by an imperial legate residing at Antioch: it was eventually divided <cb /> into ten districts, named (mostly after their capital cities) Commagené, Cyrrhesticé, Pieria, Seleucis, Chalcidicé, Chalybonitis, Palmyrené, Apamené, Cassiotis, and Laodicené; but the last is sometimes included under Cassiotis. (See the several articles.) From A.D. 66 Iudea or Syria Palaestina was recognized as a separate province, and at the end of the second century Syria was divided into two provinces, Syria Magna or Coelesyria, and Syria Phoenicé. Constantine the Great separated the two northern districts—namely, Commagené and Cyrrhesticé—and erected them into a distinct province, called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Euphratensis</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Euphratesia;</hi> and the rest of Syria was afterwards divided by Theodosius II. into the two provinces of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Syria Prima</hi>, including the sea-coast and the country north of Antioch, and having that city for its capital; and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Syria Secunda</hi>, the district along the Orontes, with Apamea for its capital; while the eastern districts were now a part of Persia.

<head orig="Syria Dea">Syria Dea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Συρίη Θεός</foreign>). A deity of generation and fecundity worshipped in Syrian Hierapolis under the name <foreign lang="greek">Ἀτάργατις</foreign>, whom the later Greeks and the Romans simply called “the Syrian goddess.” From the time of the sovereignty of the Seleucidae, when the ancient paganism was highly honoured in Hierapolis, the worship of this goddess spread among the Greeks, and from them found its way to Rome, where she had a temple in the days of the Empire, and to other parts of Italy, and still farther west. The old idea of her attributes had so widened in the course of time that she shared those of Iuno, Venus, Rhea, Cybelé, Minerva, Diana, the Parcae, and other goddesses. She is represented on Roman monuments, seated on a throne between two lions. Her priests were generally eunuchs. They were in the habit of making excursions into Greece and Italy to extend the worship of the goddess by means of ecstatic dances and prophecies, and to collect pious alms for her sanctuary.

It was for the most part a very narrow strip of sand, interspersed with salt marshes, between the sea and a range of mountains forming the edge of the Great Desert (Sahara), with only here and there a few spots capable of cultivation, especially about the river Cinyps. It was peopled by Libyan tribes. Under the Romans it formed a part of the province of Africa. It was often called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tripolitāna</hi>, from its three chief cities, Abrotonum, Oea, and Leptis Magna; and this became its usual name under the Later Empire, and has been handed down to our own time in the modern name of the regency of Tripoli.

<head orig="Syrtis">Syrtis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Σύρτις</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Syrtes.</hi> The two great gulfs in the eastern half of the northern coast of Africa. The name is derived by the ancients from <foreign lang="greek">σύρω</foreign>, “to draw” or “to suck,” but is possibly cognate with the Arabic <hi rend="italic">sert</hi>, “a desert,” a term at present applied to the whole coast as bordering upon the Great Desert. Both gulfs were proverbially dangerous, the Greater Syrtis from its sandbanks and quicksands, and its unbroken exposure to the north winds, the Less from its shelving rocky shores, its exposure to the northeast winds, and the consequent variableness of the tides in it. (1) <hi rend="bold">Syrtis Maior</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ μεγάλη Σύρτις</foreign>, Gulf of Sidra), the easternmost of the two, a wide and deep gulf on the shores of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, exactly opposite to the Ionic Sea. The Great Desert comes down close to its shores, forming a sandy coast, called by the ancients <ref type="cross" target="crosssyrtica-regio">Syrtĭca Regio</ref>. The terror of being driven on shore in it is referred to in the narrative of St. Paul's voyage to Italy (Acts, xxvii. 17, “fearing lest they should fall into the Syrtis”); and the dangers of a march through the loose sand on its shores, sometimes of a burning heat, and sometimes saturated with sea-water, were scarcely less formidable. <cb /></p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="bold">Syrtis Minor</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ μικρὰ Σύρτις</foreign>, Gulf of Khabs) lies in the southwestern angle of the great bend formed by the northern coast of Africa as it drops down to the south from the neighbourhood of Carthage, and then bears again to the east; in other words, in the angle between the eastern coast of Zeugitana and Byzacena (Tunis) and the northern coast of Tripolitana (Tripoli). In its mouth, near the northern extremity, lie the islands of Cercina and Cercinitis. In Herodotus, the word Syrtis occurs in a few passages, without any distinction between the Greater and the Less. It seems most probable that he means to denote by this term the Greater Syrtis, and that he included the Less in the lake Tritonis.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ συσσίτια</foreign>). The meals taken in public and in common among the Dorians in Sparta and Crete, and confined to men and youths only. In Sparta all the Spartiatae, or citizens over twenty years of age, were obliged to attend these meals, which were there called <foreign lang="greek">φειδίτια</foreign>. No one was allowed to absent himself except for some satisfactory reason. The table was provided for by fixed monthly contributions of barley, wine, cheese, figs, and money to buy meat; the State only paid for the maintenance of the two kings, each of whom received a double portion. The places where the syssitia were held were called tents, and the guests were divided into messes of about fifteen members, vacancies in which were filled up by ballot, unanimous consent being necessary for election. The principal dish at the syssitia was a black broth (<foreign lang="greek">μέλας ζωμός</foreign>) with pork, served with mixed wine. The tables were superintended by a woman of free birth, who had several men to assist her. She gave the best fare to those present who were most eminent in the service of the State.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>

<note id="ref4" target="n4">* Very little is known of the architectural character of the early basilicas about the Forum.</note>
<note id="ref5" target="n5">* It is stated that there were but 136 gentes in existence when the Republic was established, and that the Senate was brought up to its normal strength (300) by the free selection of the balance. It is also stated that all, or at least a portion, of the senators thus selected were plebeians; but this seems merely an inference from the other statement, and is, of course, in no sense a necessary inference. Among modern writers the dispute turns largely on the interpretation of the phrase patres conscripti. Many hold that the patres were patricians, the conscripti plebeians. Others assert that the patres were those who sat as representatives of the gentes, and that the rest, whether patricians or plebeians, were conscripti. Others again deny that there was any distinction between patres and conscripti, and translate the phrase, “enrolled senators.”</note>
