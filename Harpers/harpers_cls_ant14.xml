<head orig="Nabataei, Nabăthae">Nabataei, Nabathae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ναβαταῖοι, Ναβάται</foreign>). An Arabian race said to have descended from Ishmael. They originally dwelt in the northwestern part of Arabia, east of the Moabites; but later occupied the Sinaitic peninsula. Their capital in Roman times was <ref type="cross" target="crosspetra">Petra</ref> (q.v.). At first they were a roving pastoral people; but, as their position gave them the command of the trade between Arabia and the west, they prosecuted that trade with great energy, establishing regular caravans between Leucé Comé, a port of the Red Sea, and the port of Rhinocolura (El-Arish) on the Mediterranean, upon the frontiers of Palestine and Egypt. Sustained by this traffic, a powerful monarchy grew up, which resisted all the attacks of the Greek kings of Syria, and which, sometimes at least, extended its power as far north as Syria. Thus, in the reign of Caligula, even after the Nabathaeans had nominally submitted to Rome, we find even Damascus in possession of an ethnarch of “Aretas the king,” i. e. of the Nabathaean Arabs: the usual names of these kings were Aretas and Obodas. Under Augustus the Nabathaeans are found, as nominal subjects of the Roman Empire, assisting Aelius Gallus in his expedition into Arabia Felix, through which, and through the journey of Athenodorus to Petra, Strabo derived important information. Under Trajan the Nabathaeans were conquered by A. Cornelius Palma, and Arabia Petraea became a Roman province, A.D. 105-107. In the fourth century it was considered a part of Palestine, <cb /> and formed the diocese of a metropolitan, whose see was at Petra. The Mohammedan conquest finally overthrew the power of the Nabathaeans. See C. <bibl default="NO">Doughty, <title>Documents Épigraphiques Recueillis dans le Nord de l'Arabie</title> (1884)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossnabis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Nabis">Nabis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νάβις</foreign>). A person who succeeded in making himself tyrant of Lacedaemon on the death of Machanidas, B.C. 207. He carried his tyranny to the furthest possible extent. All persons possessed of property were subjected to incessant exactions, and the most cruel tortures if they did not succeed in satisfying his rapacity. One of his engines of torture resembled “the Maiden” of more recent times. It was a figure resembling his wife Apega, so constructed as to clasp the victim and pierce him to death with the nails with which the arms and bosom of the figure were studded (Polyb. xiii. 7). The money which he got by these means and by the plunder of the temples enabled him to raise a large body of mercenaries, whom he selected from among the most abandoned and reckless villains. With these forces he was able to extend his sway over a considerable part of Peloponnesus; but his further progress was checked by Flaminius, who after a short campaign compelled him to sue for peace (B.C. 195). The tyrant, however, was allowed to retain the sovereignty of Sparta, and soon after the departure of Flamininus from Greece he resumed hostilities. He was opposed by Philopoemen, the general of the Achaean league; and though Nabis met at first with some success, he was eventually defeated by Philopoemen, and was soon afterwards assassinated by some Aetolians who had been sent to his assistance, B.C. 192 (<bibl n="Liv.  35. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxv. 12</bibl>-35; Pausan. viii. 50).

<div2 id="crossnabonassar" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Nabonassar">Nabonassar</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ναβονάσαρος</foreign>). A king of Babylon, who lived about the middle of the eighth century before the Christian era, and who gave name to what is called the Nabonassarian Era. The origin of this era is thus represented by Syncellus from the accounts of Polyhistor and Berosus, the earliest writers extant in Chaldaean history and antiquities: “Nabonassar, having collected the acts of his predecessors, destroyed them, in order that the computation of the reigns of the Chaldaean kings might be made from himself.” It began, therefore, with the reign of Nabonassar (February 26, B.C. 747). The form of year employed in it is the movable year of 365 days, consisting of twelve equal months of thirty days, and five supernumerary days, which was the year in common use among the Chaldaeans, Egyptians, Armenians, Persians, and the principal Oriental nations from the earliest times. This year ran through all the seasons in the course of 1461 years. The freedom of the Nabonassarean Year from intercalation rendered it peculiarly convenient for astronomical calculation. Hence it was adopted by the early Greek astronomers Timochares and Hipparchus, and by those of the Alexandrian school, Ptolemy, etc. In consequence of this, the whole historical catalogue of reigns has been commonly, though improperly, called Ptolemy's Canon, because he probably continued 
<pb n="1074" /><cb /> the original table of Chaldaean and Persian kings, and added thereto the Egyptian and Roman down to his own time.

Necho, king of Egypt, jealous of the power of the latter, declared war against and defeated him. Nabopolassar died after a reign of twenty-one years.

<div2 id="crossnaevius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Naevius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gnaeus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman epic and dramatic poet. He was probably born in Campania, about B.C. 270; served in the Roman army during the First Punic War; and, settling after this at Rome, brought out his first play in 235, soon after the first appearance of Livius Andronicus. Owing to the recklessness with which he attacked the Roman nobles, especially the Metelli, he was thrown into prison, and though liberated by the tribunes of the people ( <bibl n="Gel.  3. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 3</bibl>), was afterwards banished from Rome. He died in exile at Utica about the year 199. See the epitaph in Gellius (i. 24).</p>
 <p>His poetical account of the First Punic War (<title>Bellum Punicum</title>), written when an old man in the Saturnian verse, made him the creator of the Roman national epic. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepos">Epos</ref>.) This work originally formed one continuous whole, but in a later age was divided into seven books by the scholar Octavius Lampadio ( <bibl n="Suet. Gram. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Gram.</title>2</bibl>). The fragments preserved give the impression of its having been little more than a chronicle in verse. Even in its plan, it bears a close resemblance to the prose chronicles of the Roman annalists; for here, as there, the real subject of the poem was preceded by an account of the early history of Rome, dating from the flight of Aeneas from Troy. Naevius also made an important departure in the province of dramatic poetry by creating a national drama. Besides imitations of Greek tragedies, of which seven alone are known by name and by extant fragments, it was he who first attempted to adapt the materials of Roman history to the dramatic form handed down by the Greeks. Thus, in the <title>Romulus</title> or <title>Lupus</title>, he treated of the youth of Romulus and Remus; and, in the play <title>Clastidium</title>, of a contemporary historical event. From the number of titles of his comedies still preserved (thirty-three), and from the verdict of antiquity, we may infer that his forte lay in that species of composition; and he appears to have been no mere translator of his Greek originals, but to have handled them with considerable freedom. It was in his comedies especially that he introduced his attacks on men and events of the day. The fragments of Naevius will be found in Ribbeck's <title>Poeseos Scenicae Fragmenta.</title> See De Moor, <bibl default="NO"><title>Cn. Névius</title> (Tournai, 1877)</bibl>; and Mommsen's <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, ii. pp. 519, 538, 540 (American ed.).

The poem is pure and correct in language and metrical form, and is interesting on account of its pathetic description of the misfortunes of the time.

Apprised of these plans, Agrippina drove Narcissus into a kind of temporary exile by compelling him to go to the baths of Campania for his health; and, having taken advantage of his absence from Rome to poison the emperor, she next compelled Narcissus to put himself to death. He is said to have amassed a fortune of 400,000,000 sesterces or $16,000,000 ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 11. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xi. 30</bibl>-35<bibl n="Tac.

In A.D. 538 he was placed at the head of an army destined to support Belisarius in the expulsion of the Ostrogoths from Italy; but the dissensions which soon arose between them occasioned his recall.

He also conquered Teias, whom the Goths had chosen king in the place of Totila, and, in the spring of 554, Bucellinus, the leader of the Alemanni.

As a text-critic and editor, Nauck must be ranked among the greatest of the century, and his writings in this field are very numerous. As a controversialist he was often too harsh in his language. The following are his bestknown works: An edition of the fragments of Aristophanes of Byzantium <bibl default="NO">(1848)</bibl>; the complete works of Euripides, with the fragments <bibl default="NO">(1854; last ed. 1877)</bibl>; an annotated edition of Sophocles based upon Schneidewin <bibl default="NO">(1867)</bibl>; the <title>Odyssey</title> and <title>Iliad</title> of Homer <bibl default="NO">(1874-77)</bibl>; Iamblichus on Pythagoras <bibl default="NO">(1884)</bibl>; select works of Porphyrius <bibl default="NO">(1886)</bibl>; and greatest of all his <bibl default="NO"><title>Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta</title> (1856)</bibl>, with a lexicon or rather index <bibl default="NO">(1892)</bibl>.

They were forty-eight in number, twelve from each of the old phylae. Each of them was obliged to furnish two horsemen and a ship towards the army and navy. The naucrari, who were at their head, seem to have formed a college or corporate body, who occupied themselves especially with all military and financial affairs, while current business was managed by the <foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖς</foreign>, whose office was the Prytaneum. Clisthenes raised their number to fifty, five from each of the ten new phylae, and probably restricted in functions to the services of the State, and especially the fleet.

Its importance was lessened after Alexandria was founded. It was the birthplace of Athenaeus and Iulius Pollux. Important excavations were made here by Mr. Flinders Petrie in 1885 and 1886, with the result of adding greatly to our knowledge of the Graeco-Egyptian period. Naucratis possessed a temple to Aphrodité, one to Heré, and a smaller one to Castor and Pollux, besides a very great one, the Panhellenion, the central religious meeting-place of all the Greeks in Egypt. In the heart of the city stood the oldest temple of all, dedicated to the Milesian Apollo.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ναῦς</foreign>). A ship. It is doubtless owing to the fact that the Mediterranean suffers from frequent calms lasting for days at a time, that the characteristic implements of navigation in that sea were oars, and that the chief problems of ancient shipbuilding were problems relating to the use of oars. The art of rowing is historically first discernible upon the river Nile. The earliest representation of rowing found on the Egyptian monuments dates from at least B.C. 2500, and there is evidence that paddling was the older practice. Among the Greeks, the generic term for the oars of a ship was <foreign lang="greek">τάρσος</foreign>, a word applicable to the wing of a bird; so that the name sufficiently indicates the earliest “wings” of a ship to have been its oars. In the <title>Iliad</title>, ships of twenty rowers and fifty rowers are often mentioned, and in the <title>Odyssey</title> as well. In the so-called Homeric “Catalogue of Ships” there is mention of vessels with as many as 118 oarsmen. In the course of time, since the ships could not be indefinitely lengthened as the number of oarsmen increased, the oars began to be arranged in two and then in three banks, one above the other. Two-banked ships-of-war were used by the Phoenicians as early as B.C. 700, for they are represented in the Assyrian sculptures of that date, and Herodotus states that three-banked war-ships were built in Egypt about B.C. 600. Among the Greeks the first vessels of this type were not generally employed until about B.C. 500, chiefly in Sicily and Corfu. Ships with four banks of oars were built by the Athenians a little earlier than B.C. 330, and ships of five banks in B.C. 325. <figure id="fig.01078">
<head orig="Egyptian Ship (Mariette).">Egyptian Ship (Mariette).</head>
</figure> Pliny the Elder speaks of ships having six banks as built at Syracuse; Quintus Curtius says that seven-banked ships were built by Alexander, and Pliny also speaks of ships having ten banks of oars. Plutarch tells of a thirteen-banked ship built by Demetrius in B.C. 301, and of fifteen, and sixteen-banked ships in B.C. 288. Polybius and Plutarch mention a sixteen-banked ship belonging to the Macedonians as arriving in the Tiber in B.C. 167, 
<pb n="1079" /><cb /> and as giving a name to one of the docks at Rome. Under the Ptolemies in Egypt, ships of twenty, thirty, and forty banks of oars are spoken of by Pliny and Plutarch, and these statements are apparently confirmed by an inscription discovered in Cyprus some years ago.</p>
 <p>While, however, the art of rowing was developed before the art of sailing, in later times the use of oars was in general restricted to ships-ofwar, which were thus made independent of the wind. In merchant vessels, on the other hand, sails were generally used, thus requiring a much smaller crew and thereby securing an economy of men. Ships-of-war, however, were also rigged with sails, though in a somewhat peculiar manner. The mast was low and carried a square sail attached to a yard. This mast was unshipped during a battle and in its stead a small foremast with a similar sail was used in place of it. Only merchant vessels appear to have carried three sails, and were very much more seaworthy than ships-of-war, being built heavier and of greater depth. The helm was usually strengthened by a stay made of two strong beams stretched between the two ends of the vessel; the bow and stern were built after the same form, and were usually the only parts of the ship to be covered with half-decks, the middle of the vessel being left open except in later times, though merchant vessels occasionally had the regular full deck. </p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Homeric Ship</hi>.—The Homeric ship or galley had a sharp black hull, but was not as yet provided with a ram. The keel (<foreign lang="greek">τρόπις</foreign>) was probably first laid upon short upright banks (<foreign lang="greek">δρύοχοι</foreign>) of timber, laid level at suitable intervals. From the keel sprang the stem-post (<foreign lang="greek">στεῖρα</foreign>), carried upward to a good height, as was also the stern-post. The sides (<foreign lang="greek">τοῖχοι</foreign>) were held together by the thwarts (<foreign lang="greek">ζύγα</foreign>), which formed the seats for the oarsmen. At the bow was a raised platform or deck (<foreign lang="greek">ἴκρια πρώρης</foreign>), on which stood the fighting men of the ship; and there was a similar deck at the stern, on which the arms were kept, and under which there was room for stowage. The length of the fifty-oared galley is calculated to have been about 90 to 100 feet from stem to stern, with a breadth amidships of 10 to 12 feet. The galley was propelled by oars and sails together, the <cb /> mast (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστός</foreign>) being raised or lowered as stated above. When raised it was held in a sort of box (<foreign lang="greek">μεσόδμη</foreign>), and kept in its place by forestays (<foreign lang="greek">πρότονοι</foreign>). When lowered it rested on a sort of crutch (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστοδόκη</foreign>). There was also a backstay (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίτονος</foreign>). The sail was hoisted on a yard (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκριον</foreign>) having braces (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπέραι</foreign>) and halyards (<foreign lang="greek">κάλοι</foreign>). The sails were square in shape and white in colour. The ropes were of thong; but larger cables (<foreign lang="greek">ὅπλα</foreign>) were made of byblus (<title>Odyss.</title> xxii. 391), occasionally of hemp or rushes (<foreign lang="greek">σπάρτα</foreign>). The ship was steered by paddles (<foreign lang="greek">πηδάλια</foreign>). The oars (<foreign lang="greek">ἐρετμά</foreign>) were of fir-wood, the parts being the handle (<foreign lang="greek">κώπη</foreign>) and blade (<foreign lang="greek">πηδόν</foreign>). The oars were fastened to thowls (<foreign lang="greek">σκαλμοί</foreign>) by thongs, and when not in use were drawn in, leaving the blade projecting. The master of the ship (<foreign lang="greek">κυβερνήτης</foreign>) had his place on the forward deck. At times a long pole for pushing (<foreign lang="greek">κοντός</foreign>) was used as an instrument of propulsion.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Post-Homeric Ship</hi>.—As civilization and commerce grew and extended, various types of vessel were evolved. The two-banked ship (<foreign lang="greek">διήρης</foreign>, <seg lang="la">biremis</seg>) and the three-banked ship (<foreign lang="greek">τριήρης</foreign>, <seg lang="la">triremis</seg>) now appear to replace the earlier <foreign lang="greek">μονήρης</foreign>, and are soon developed into the ship of many banks (<foreign lang="greek">πολυήρεις</foreign>) mentioned above. In the bireme the second row of oarsmen sat a little lower than the first row, nearer the water-line, and with shorter oars. (From their being more in the hold (<foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος</foreign>) of the vessel, they get the name of <foreign lang="greek">θαλαμῖται</foreign>.) This was a great step in advance, as it doubled the motive power without adding appreciably to the length or bulk of the vessel. In the trireme we have merely an extension of the principle. The arrangement of the oarsmen in this type of ship and in those in which the number of banks of oars was still larger is not definitely known, and the question involves great difficulties. It is really impossible to conceive how the thirty or forty banked ships could have been worked, since the longest oars would have had a length of 38 cubits, or say 57 English feet. Mr. Ridgeway ingeniously suggests (<title>Class. Review</title>, June, 1895) that the word <foreign lang="greek">στοῖχος</foreign>, rendered “bank” or “tier,” really refers to the <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> of men viewed from stem to stern, five or six oarsmen pulling each oar, and not to banks of oars at all. He calls attention to the significant fact that no representation of a manybanked ship has come down to us on coins, medals, etc. All that we do know is that the rowers in the three-banks were not separated by decks; that the whole rowing strength of the trireme was 170 men; and that the crew was densely packed, so that Cicero says that not a single additional person could enter. Each man had a cushion (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπηρέσιον</foreign>), and the rowing port-holes were protected by leather bags (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσκώματα</foreign>), intended to prevent the wash in a rough sea from entering the hold.</p>
 <p>The oarsmen having the longest oars were called <foreign lang="greek">θρανῖται</foreign>, and were 62 in number; those with the next longest were called <foreign lang="greek">ζύγιοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ζυγῖται</foreign>, 54 in number; and those with the shortest oars, <foreign lang="greek">θαλαμῖται</foreign>, 54 in number. They all entered in regular order, and took their places with the strictest regard to discipline, and thus also they disembarked. The whole complement of an Athenian trireme was about 210 persons—170 oarsmen, 15 to 20 sailors, and 10 to 12 marines (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβάται</foreign>), besides the officers.</p>
 <p>The normal dimensions of the Attic trireme are differently estimated by different archaeologists. Cartault regards the length over all as 113 feet, 
<pb n="1080" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01080">

</figure>
 with a maximum breadth of about 15 1/2 feet, height of deck above water 10 feet, and draught 6 feet. Graser puts the length at 149 feet, the maximum breadth at 18 feet, a deck height of 11 feet, a draught of 8 1/2 feet, and a capacity of 232 1/2 tons. <figure id="fig.01080.2">
<head orig="Supposed Plan of a Trireme. (Graser.)">Supposed Plan of a Trireme. (Graser.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>There were developed, roughly speaking, in the post-Homeric times, three types of ship: (1) the trading-vessel, propelled principally by sail-power, roomy, wide, and safe;</p>
 <p>(2) the pirate-vessel, using both sails and oars, swift, sharp, yet with sufficient room for storing the plunder; and</p>
 <p>(3) the man-ofwar (<foreign lang="greek">ναῦς μακρά</foreign>, <seg lang="la">navis longa</seg>), intended first of all for fighting. This last was high out of water, less steady than the trader, having bulwarks of great strength running the whole length of the ship, propelled principally by oars. This type finds its highest expression in the Athenian trireme.</p>
 <p>A ship with a single bank of oars (<foreign lang="greek">μονήρης</foreign>) was also named according to the number of oarsmen employed—thus, <foreign lang="greek">πεντηκόντορος</foreign>, with fifty rowers; <foreign lang="greek">ἑξηκόντορος</foreign>, with sixty rowers, etc. <figure id="fig.01080.3">
<head orig="Trading-ship. (From a Vase in the British Museum.)">Trading-ship. (From a Vase in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p><title>Decks.</title>—The earliest Greek ships were decked over at the stem and at the stern, as described above; but towards B.C. 500 the ships appear without poop. Occasionally about this time the forecastle is represented as supporting the forepart of a hurricane-deck and enclosing a cabin below. The stern now held a tier of seats for the steerer and for officers. There was also usually a deck-house at the stern for the commander, oftenest lightly <cb /> constructed of wicker-work, and sometimes merely of canvas. Later ships have deck-houses all along the upper deck, and these were sometimes fitted up very luxuriously, like the <seg lang="la">cabines de luxe</seg> on a modern transatlantic liner, having paintings, statuary, marble-baths, and even libraries in the saloons. Alongside ran covered promenades, lined with rows of vines, and even trees planted in tubs (Athen. v. 41; <title>Calig.</title> 37). But these vessels partook probably more of the nature of barges than of actual ships. A decked ship was called <foreign lang="greek">κατάφρακτος</foreign>; an open ship, <foreign lang="greek">ἄφρακτος</foreign>.</p>
 <p>War-vessels carried turrets on their upper decks, whence missiles might be showered upon an enemy; and these are also found on merchant-vessels that traversed waters infested by pirates. These turrets were movable. Some ships carried as many as eight; and they were often of several stories. The colours in which they were painted identified the squadron to which they belonged. Lest the ships should be made top-heavy by these turrets, large quantities of ballast were carried at the bottom of the hold, usually gravel or sand or <figure id="fig.01080.4">
<head orig="Pirate-ship. (From a Vase in the British Museum.)">Pirate-ship. (From a Vase in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure> stone. Vessels were baled by a machine worked by a sort of tread-mill (Athen. v. 43), but in early times by buckets (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντλητήρια</foreign>, <seg lang="la">sentinacula</seg>). Drinking-water was carried in cisterns.</p>
 <p><title>Rams.</title>—The forepart of war-ships was constructed largely with regard to the use of the ram (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμβολος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">rostrum</seg>), being built very strongly, with massive cat-heads projecting far enough to tear away the upper works of a hostile ship. There were auxiliary rams besides the principal one. Rams were <figure id="fig.01080.5">
<head orig="Ram. (Monttaucon.)">Ram. (Monttaucon.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="1081" /><cb />
 usually of bronze, but sometimes of iron. The principal ram of a trireme weighed some 170 pounds. It usually had three prongs, and often sloped downward, as the one shown above. Before the use of rams, heads of animals had usually been carved <figure id="fig.01081">
<head orig="Ram. (From a medal.)">Ram. (From a medal.)</head>
</figure> upon the prows as figure-heads, the subject corresponding to the name of the ship. Thus, a crocodile would go with a ship named <title>Nilus;</title> a mountain with one named <title>Ida</title>, etc. There were regular national emblems so used, as the statue of Pallas Athené by Athenian ships and a head of Ammon by the Carthaginians. In Roman ships of about A.D. 50 a gilded swan or goose was common. The stern was often ornamented by a painting or relief, and by a carving resembling originally the Egyptian lotus, but developed, in time, into a sort of plume or fan. On the bow of the ship there was also generally a huge eye, or sometimes a pair of eyes.</p>
 <p><title>Rudders.</title>—See <ref type="cross" target="crossgubernaculum">Gubernaculum</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Anchors.</title>—In early times the anchors (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγκύρα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">ancora</seg>) were stones (<foreign lang="greek">εὐναί</foreign>). The metal anchor with arms was said to be the invention of Ana<figure id="fig.01081.2">
<head orig="Anchor. (Column of Trajan.)">Anchor. (Column of Trajan.)</head>
</figure> charsis (B.C. 600). They were first of iron and later of lead with a wooden shank. The remains of one lately found near Cyrené afford evidence that for a ship of some 200 tons the anchor weighed some 1400 pounds. The anchor was often slung over the stern, and when in use had its position marked by cork buoys (<foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα ἀγκύρας</foreign>). The cables (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ σχοῖνα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">ancoralia</seg>) were sometimes of chain, but usually of rope.</p>
 <p><title>Sails.</title>—The sail (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστίον</foreign>) was often made of pieces of canvas stitched together, whence the plural <foreign lang="greek">ἱστία</foreign> often means only a single sail. They were sometimes strengthened by strips of leather sewn over the stitching. At the lower extremities of <figure id="fig.01081.3"><head>Brailing the Sails of a Ship. (Mazois, <bibl n="D. H. Pomp. 1. 22." default="NO"> <title>Pomp.</title>i. 22.</bibl>) </head></figure> the sail were the sheets (<foreign lang="greek">πόδες</foreign>) and tacks (<foreign lang="greek">πρόποδες</foreign>). Instead of reefing the sails the ancients appear rather to have brailed them up (<foreign lang="greek">στέλλειν</foreign>, <cb /> <foreign lang="greek">παραιρεῖν</foreign>) to reduce the area exposed to the wind. In battle the war-ships depended wholly upon their oars.</p>
 <p><title>Material for Ships.</title>—The hull was usually of pine or fir; cedar and cypress are also mentioned. The keels were of pine and the false keels of oak or beech. Barbarian ships of leather ( <title>B. C.</title> i. 54) are mentioned. The masts and yards were made of fir or pine, and so also the oars. The seams of the ship were calked by packing them with tow fastened by wax or tar; and the whole outer planking was protected by a coating of similar materials, coloured. Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 31</bibl> and 41) mentions seven colours as used; but in later times a colour resembling that of the sea-water was employed, probably to enable the vessel to escape observation from enemies, a device employed in modern navies. The timbers were held together by wooden pegs and metal nails.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Roman Ship</hi>.—The Romans, though not a seafaring people, appear from the treaty with Carthage to have been familiar with the sea, and to have had maritime interests as early as the time of the kings. The existence of <seg lang="la">duumviri navales</seg>, officers charged with repairing the fleet, the right of electing whom was transferred to the people in B.C. 311, proves that the State had, at that time and previously, some naval force; and coins of a date as early as B.C. 350 bear the representation of the bows of a ship of a type more rude than the Greek, but still very possibly borrowed from the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. In the instances exhibited by the coins, which belong to the halfcentury preceding the First Punic War, there are apparently two varieties of construction. In one the depression of the beak is remarkable, and the timbers which support it appear to be compacted with cross-pieces. These vessels were probably triremes. In the year B.C. 303 a treaty was made with the Tarentines, by which the Lacinian Promontory was made the boundary beyond which the Roman war-ships were not to pass. L. Cornelius in B.C. 282 violated that treaty, and was defeated by the Tarentines with the loss of half his fleet. The Samnite Wars seem to have diverted the attention of the Romans entirely from maritime affairs, and at the beginning of the Punic Wars they were practically without a fleet. They then first seem to have realized the fact that in the conflict which was before them the mastery of the Mediterranean was an absolute necessity, not only for the protection of their own coasts, which already had suffered from the descents of the Carthaginian fleets, but also as the first step towards empire (Polyb. i. 20, 21). Hence, in the year B.C. 260, when a Carthaginian quinquereme which had been driven on shore fell into their hands, they determined to construct a fleet of similar vessels. No less than 100 were built in six weeks, while their future crews were practised rowing in frame-work set up on land. Cn. Cornelius with seventeen of these vessels sailed in advance to attack the Carthaginians, but was himself attacked and taken with all his vessels. Duilius, who then took the command of the fleet, by the invention of the <seg lang="la">corvus</seg> (Polyb. i. 22, 23)—a swinging bridge with a heavy iron spike, which, when let fall on the enemy's deck, not only grappled his vessel, but gave the boarders access to it—was enabled to neutralize the ramming tactics of the Carthaginians and their superior naval skill. The battles 
<pb n="1082" /><cb />
 of Mylae and of Ecnomus, in which the Carthaginians were defeated with great loss, were the prelude of maritime dominion to Rome. The importance of the ram was thus much diminished, and in the coins of the century following we see the ram much less projecting and apparently less strongly supported. On the other hand, the <foreign lang="greek">δελφίς</foreign>, great beams and great grappling hooks, iron hands, and <seg lang="la">falces</seg> with curved steel heads, such as those with which the sailing vessels of the Veneti were crippled by Caesar off the coast of Gaul ( <title>B. G.</title> iii. 14), came into favour. Huge towers (<seg lang="la">turres</seg>) were placed in the bows—whence our term “forecastle”—from which missiles could be showered on the enemy's deck. The main object of Roman tactics seemed to be to leave as little as possible to seamanship and skill, and to come to close quarters and a hand-to-hand fight as soon as possible. In a word, boarding tactics superseded ramming tactics. See Polyb. i. 61; <bibl n="Liv.  36. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxvi. 44</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  45" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 45</bibl>; xxxvii. 24<bibl n="Liv.  30." default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 30.</bibl></p>
 <p>As early as B.C. 413 the use of fire ( <bibl n="Thuc.  7. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.vii. 53</bibl>) in a naval action is mentioned. Later, catapults, the precursors of artillery, launched Greek fire rocket-fashion against the enemy.</p>
 <p>The Liburnian galleys were biremes (Lucan, iii. 534). The name seems to have been taken from <figure id="fig.01082">
<head orig="Naval Battle. (Pompeian Painting.)">Naval Battle. (Pompeian Painting.)</head>
</figure> the vessels of the Liburnians, an Illyrian race, inhabiting the islands of that coast and much given to piracy. The name Liburnian, in the same way as the name trireme, came afterwards to be used for any ship of war.</p>
 <p>In the time of Trajan some attempt was made to build larger rates than biremes, and Valentinian had quinqueremes constructed. But in the Byzantine period no vessels with more banks than two appear; and the tendency is to return to single banks, which, according to the emperor Leo (<title>Tactica</title>), are called <foreign lang="greek">γαλαῖαι</foreign>, “galleys.”</p>
 <p>Under the emperors two great naval stations were established for the fleets that were intended to keep the peace of the Mediterranean—(1) at Ravenna, for the east; and</p>
 <p>(2) at Misenum, on the Campanian coast, for the west. There were also guard-ships regularly stationed on the coast of Gaul at Forum Iulii (Fréjus) and Portus Herculis Monoeci (Monaco). But after Actium there is little to interest us in naval affairs, with the exception perhaps of Germanicus's operations in the North Sea, and at a later date the war with the Vandals, for which Procopius is our authority, until the time of the Byzantine emperor Leo (A.D. 960). In the following centuries came the invention of the <cb /> <seg lang="la">apostis</seg> (a projecting framework, upon the edge of which were set the thowlpins, thus enabling oars of greater length to be used) and the birth of the mediaeval galley, which, with its long sweeps worked by several men, was a vessel distinct from the ancient men-of-war.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Sailors and Marines</hi>.—The Athenian fleet was manned in its best days by freemen. Xenophon tells us that the seafaring habits of the Athenians were such that every one knew how to handle an oar, and that the crew of a trireme could be got together at once. At the time of the Peloponnesian War the pay of an ordinary oarsman was three obols a day, increased towards the end of the war to four obols. The pay of the <hi rend="italic">thranitae</hi> was higher, their services being valued at a drachma. Raising the pay of seamen during hostilities was a favourite expedient with a view to induce the enemy's crews to desert. There were, however, many causes that led to the employment of forced labour, and with it to the deterioration and unpopularity of sea-service. The unavoidable discomfort in a decked ship must have been extreme. In a hot climate, with little ventilation, the participation with 200 or 300 human beings, all stark naked and packed closely in a laborious mechanical toil, could only have been voluntarily endured under the pressure of some great necessity or sense of duty. The heat, the smell, the drudgery, must have been terrible. Besides the discomfort, the actual danger was very great. The crews might at any time be drowned or burned, or, as at Sybota ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 50</bibl>), butchered perhaps in cold blood. We have only to think of the moment of conflict—the crash of the beak through the timbers, and the mangled mass of humanity hurled into the bilge, while the water swiftly followed the blow, the <hi rend="italic">thranitae</hi>, perhaps, escaping, but the lower ranks almost certainly drowned—and it is easy to understand how the service was avoided by the free and left to slaves. The marines (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβάται</foreign>) varied in number, the Athenian ship carrying few, and the Chians, at the battle of Ladé, for instance, as many as forty to each vessel.</p>
 <p>The Romans manned their fleet by levies from the lowest orders and forced service of the allies. The greater proportion of the crews were slaves contributed as substitutes, and it is this fact, perhaps, which explains the equanimity with which such wholesale loss of life at sea as is recorded by Polybius was endured. Among the Romans themselves service on board ship was most unpopular; 
<pb n="1083" /><cb />
 and it is not surprising to find discontented <seg lang="la">classiarii</seg> wishing to be transferred to the legions. The Roman term for marines is <seg lang="la">classiarii milites.</seg> They were held in less esteem than regular soldiers. <figure id="fig.01083">

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νεάπολις</foreign>). The name of a number of ancient cities.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. European</hi>.—(1) Now Napoli (Naples); a city of Campania in Italy on the western slope of Mount Vesuvius and the river Sebethus (Maddalena). It was founded about B.C. 1056 by Aeolian Chalcidians of Cumae, on the site of an ancient place called <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenope">Parthenŏpé</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρθενόπη</foreign>), after the Siren of that name. Hence we find the town called Parthenopé by Vergil and Ovid. The year of the foundation of Neapolis is not recorded. It was perhaps called the “New City,” because regarded simply as a new quarter of the neighbouring city of Cumae. When the town is first mentioned in Roman history it consisted of two parts, divided from each other by a wall, and called respectively Palaeopolis and Neapolis. This division probably arose after the capture of Cumae by the Samnites, <figure id="fig.01083.2">
<head orig="Coin of the Campanian Neapolis (about B.C. 300.)">Coin of the Campanian Neapolis (about B.C. 300.)</head>
</figure> when a large number of the Cumaeans took refuge in the city they had founded, whereupon the old quarter was called Palaeopolis, and the new quarter, built to accommodate the new inhabitants, was named Neapolis. There has been a dispute respecting the site of these two quarters; but it is probable that Palaeopolis was situated on the west side near the harbour, and Neapolis on the east side near the river Sebethus. In B.C. 327 the town was taken by the Samnites, and in 290 it 
<pb n="1084" /><cb />
 passed into the hands of the Romans, who allowed it, however, to retain its Greek constitution. At a later period it became a municipium, and finally a Roman colony. Under the Romans the two quarters of the city were united, and the name of Palaeopolis disappeared. It continued to be a prosperous and flourishing place till the time of the Empire; and its beautiful scenery and the luxurious life of its Greek population made it a favourite residence with many of the Romans. In the reign of Titus the city was destroyed by an earthquake, but was rebuilt by this emperor in the Roman style. The modern city of Naples does not stand on exactly the same site as Neapolis. The ancient city extended farther east than the modern city, since the former was situated on the Sebethus, whereas the latter does not reach so far as the Fiume della Maddalena; but the modern city, on the other hand, extends farther north and west than the ancient one, since the island of Megaris, on which the Castel del Ovo now stands, was situated in ancient times between Pausilypum and Neapolis. In the neighbourhood of Neapolis there were warm baths, the celebrated villa of Lucullus, and the Villa Pausilypi or Pausilypum, bequeathed by Vedius Pollio to Augustus, and which has given its name to the celebrated grotto of Posilippo between Naples and Pozzuoli, at the entrance of which what is called the tomb of Vergil is still shown. Augustus frequently visited the city, and Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, Titus, and Hadrian favoured it in many ways. In 536 it was taken by Belisarius, and in 543 by the Goths under Totila. Naples is a city of much interest to archaeologists, both because of its proximity to Pompeii and Herculaneum, and because of its remarkable collection of ancient works of art and industry preserved in the Museo Nazionale.

From about B.C. 575 on wards, athletic competitions were added to the festival, after the model of those at Olympia; and, like the latter, it was only gradually that it developed into a general Hellenic celebration. It was held twice in a period of four years—once in August, every fourth year; once in winter, every second or first Olympic year. It is more probable, however, that the so-called “Winter Nemea” were only local games held in Argos, and that the Panhellenic Nemea were celebrated in alternate years at the end of every first and third Olympic year, at a time corresponding to our July. The question is discussed by Unger in the <title>Philologus</title> (xxxiv. 50), but Droysen, in <title>Hermes</title> (xiv. 1), considers it still unsettled. The management of the festival was originally possessed by the Cleonaeans, but soon passed, together with the possession of the sanctuary, into the hands of the Argives. The games, which lasted more than one day (<bibl n="Liv.  27. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxvii. 31</bibl>), consisted of gymnastic, equestrian, and musical contests (for the two former, see <ref type="cross" target="crossolympia">Olympia</ref>); the prize was a palm-branch and a garland of fresh <foreign lang="greek">σέλινον</foreign>, often rendered “parsley,” but more probably identical with the “wild celery.” See Krause, <title>Pythien, Nemeen, und Isthmien</title>, and the scholiasts on Pindar.

<head orig="Nemĕsis">Nemesis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νέμεσις</foreign>). A post-Homeric personification of the moral indignation felt at all derangements of the natural equilibrium of things, whether by extraordinarily good fortune or by the arrogance usually attendant thereon. According to Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 223) she is the daughter of Night (Nyx), and with Aidos, the goddess of Modesty, left the earth on the advent of the Iron Age. A legend makes her to have been by Zeus the mother of Helen and the Dioscuri (Athen. p. 334). As goddess of due proportion she hates every transgression of the bounds of moderation, and restores the proper and normal order of things. As, in doing this, she punishes wanton boastfulness, she is a divinity of chastisement and vengeance. She enjoyed special honour in the Attic district of Rhamnus (where she was believed to be the daughter of Oceanus), and is often called the Rhamnusian goddess. Her statue there <bibl default="NO">(of which fragments were found in 1890)</bibl> was said to have been executed by Phidias out of a block of Parian marble which the Persians had brought with them in presumptuous confidence to Marathon, to erect a trophy of victory there. She was also called Adrastia, that name appropriate only to the Phrygian Rhea-Cybelé, being interpreted as a Greek word with the meaning, “She whom none can escape.” She was also worshipped at Rome, especially by victorious generals, and was represented as a meditative, thoughtful maiden with the attributes of proportion and control (a measuring-rod, a bridle, and a yoke), of punishment (a sword and scourge), and of swiftness (wings, a wheel, and a chariot drawn by griffins).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νεοπτόλεμος</foreign>, also called <ref type="cross" target="crosspyrrhus">Pyrrhus;</ref> i. e. the ruddy). (1) The son of Achilles and Deïdamia. He was brought up by his grandfather Lycomedes in Scyros. After Achilles' death, however, he was led by Odysseus to Troy, since, according to the prophecy of Helenus, that town could be taken only by a descendant of Aeacus. Here, like his father, he distinguished himself above all by a courage which none could withstand. He slew Eurypylus, son of Telephus, and was one of the heroes in the wooden horse, where he alone remained undaunted. Later legend depicts him as fierce and cruel: at the taking of Troy he killed the aged Priam at the altar of Zeus, hurled Hector's son, Astyanax, down from the walls, and offered up Polyxena upon his father's tomb. In Homer he arrives safely with much booty at Phthia, his father's home, and weds Menelaüs's daughter Hermioné, who was promised him during the siege of Troy ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 5" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 5</bibl>). Later legend represents him as accompanied by Andromaché, Hector's wife, who is allotted him as a part of his booty, and Helenus, and then, on the strength of a prophecy of Helenus, as going to Epirus and settling there. It was to a son of his by Lanassa, granddaughter of Heracles, that the later kings of Epirus traced back their descent, and accordingly styled themselves Aeacidae; while from his son by Andromaché, Molossus, the district of Molossia was said to derive its name (Pausan. i. 11). He afterwards went to Phthia, to reinstate his grandfather Peleus in his kingdom whence he had been expelled by Acastus and wedded Hermioné. He soon, however, met his death at Delphi, whither, according to one story, he had gone with dedicatory offerings, or, according to another, to plunder the temple of Apollo in revenge for his father's death. The accounts of his death vary, some attributing it to Orestes, the earlier lover of Hermioné; others <cb /> to the Delphians, at the instance of the Pythian priestess; others again to a quarrel about the meat-offerings. The scene of his death was the altar, a coincidence which was regarded as a judgment for his murder of Priam. His tomb was within the precincts of the Delphic temple, and in later times he was worshipped as a hero with annual sacrifices by the Delphians, as he was said to have vouchsafed valuable assistance against the Gauls when they threatened the sacred spot (B.C. 279) (Pausan. x. 23).</p>

Besides erotic poems, three books of <title>Chronica</title>, five books of <title>Exempla</title> (probably an account of the men who were typical of the early Roman virtues), biographies of Cato and Cicero, and a geographical treatise, all of which, except a few fragments, are lost, he wrote a series of biographies in at least sixteen books (<title>De Viris Illustribus</title>), in which the lives of famous Greeks and Romans were narrated in parallel arrangement. Of this work there remain the part treating of foreign generals and the biographies of Cato and Atticus. The style of Nepos is not good, as it borders on the colloquial; but the biographies are of considerable historical value, as being fair, sympathetic, and well arranged.

 <p> The Italian god of the sea, husband of Salacia, the goddess of salt water (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 72), and identified by the Romans with the Greek Poseidon. This identification dated from B.C. 399, when a <seg lang="la">lectisternium</seg> (q. v.) was ordained in his honour by the Sibylline Books (<bibl n="Liv.  5. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 13</bibl>). Like Poseidon, he was worshipped as god of the sea and of equestrian accomplishments. As such he had a temple in the Circus Flaminius, while in the Circus Maximus the old Italian god Consus had an altar in a similar capacity. In after-times Agrippa built a temple and portico to Neptune on the Field of Mars, in honour of his naval victory over Sextus Pompeius and Antonius. A festival of Neptune (Neptunalia), accompanied by games, was celebrated on July 23. The old harbour-god of the Romans was <ref type="cross" target="crossportunus">Portunus</ref> (q.v.). The original conception of Neptunus was of a god presiding over rivers and springs, as the early Romans had little to do with the sea. The wider view which made him primarily a sea-god is possibly due to the influence of the Etruscan religion in which Neptune (Nethuns) was so regarded.

 <p>(2) A general in the Second Punic War, who defeated and slew the Carthaginian Hasdrubal at the battle of the Metaurus, thus probably saving Rome from capture (B.C. 207).</p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crosstiberius">Tiberius</ref>, father of the emperor and a partisan of Iulius Caesar and afterwards of Antony. He surrendered his beautiful wife <ref type="cross" target="crosslivia">Livia</ref> (q.v.) to Octavianus (Augustus), who married her. Nero died soon after ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 10</bibl>; v. 1; Dio Cass. xlviii. 44).</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Claudius Caesar</hi>. The sixth of the Roman emperors, born at Antium, in Latium, A.D. 37, nine months after the death of Tiberius. He was the son of Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus, and was originally named Lucius Domitius. After the death of Ahenobarbus, and a second husband, Crispus Passienus, Agrippina married her uncle, the emperor Claudius, who gave his daughter Octavia in marriage to her son Lucius, and subsequently 
<pb n="1089" /><cb /> adopted him with the formal sanction of a <title>lex Curiata.</title></p>
 <p>The education of Nero was carefully attended to in his youth. He was placed under the care of the philosopher Seneca, and appears to have applied himself with considerable perseverance to study. He is said to have made great progress in Greek, of which he gave a specimen in his sixteenth year, by pleading in that tongue the rights of the Rhodians, and of the inhabitants of Ilium ( <bibl n="Suet. Nero 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 7</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 12. 58" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xii. 58</bibl>). At the death of Claudius (A.D. 54), while Agrippina, by flatteries and lamentations, detained Britannicus, the son of Claudius and Messalina, within the palace, Nero, presenting himself before the gates, was lifted by the guard-in-waiting into the covered chariot used for the purpose of carrying in procession an elected emperor, and was followed by a multitude of the people, under the illusion that it was Britannicus. He entered the camp, promised a donative to the cohorts, was saluted emperor, and pronounced before the Senate, in honour of Claudius, a panegyric composed by his preceptor Seneca. <figure id="fig.01089">

 <p>Agrippina soon endeavoured to obtain the chief management of public affairs; and her vindictive and cruel temper would have hurried Nero, at the commencement of his reign, into acts of violence and bloodshed, if her influence had not been counteracted by Seneca and Burrus, to whom Nero had intrusted the government of the State. Through their counsels the first five years of Nero's reign were distinguished by justice and clemency; and an anecdote is related of him, that, having on one occasion to sign an order for the execution of a malefactor, he exclaimed, “Would that I could not write!” ( <bibl n="Suet. Nero 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 10</bibl>). He discouraged public informers, refused the statues of gold and silver which were offered him by the Senate and people, and used every art to ingratiate himself with the latter. But his mother was enraged to find that her power over him became weaker every day, and that he constantly disregarded her advice and refused her requests. His neglect of his wife Octavia, and his criminal love of Acté, a woman of low birth, still farther widened the breach between him and his mother. She frequently addressed him in the most contemptuous language; reminded him that he owed his elevation solely to her, and threatened that she would inform the soldiers of the manner in which Claudius had met his end, and would call upon them to support the claims of Britannicus, the son of the late emperor. The threats of his mother only served to hasten the death of Britannicus, whose murder forms the commencement of that long catalogue of crimes which afterwards disgraced <cb /> the reign of Nero. But while the management of public affairs appears, from the testimony of most historians, to have been wisely conducted by Burrus and Seneca, Nero indulged in private in dissipation and profligacy. He was accustomed, in company with other young men of his own age, to sally into the streets of Rome at night, in order to rob and maltreat passengers, and even to break into private houses and carry off the property of their owners. But these extravagances were comparatively harmless; his love for Poppaea, whom he had seduced from Otho, led him into more serious crimes. Poppaea, who was ambitious of sharing the imperial throne, perceived that she could not hope to attain her object while Agrippina was alive, and, accordingly, induced Nero to consent to the murder of his mother. The entreaties of Poppaea appear to have been supported by the advice of Burrus and Seneca; and the philosopher did not hesitate to justify the murder of a mother by her son ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 11</bibl>; <bibl n="Quint.  8. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.viii. 5</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In the eighth year of his reign, Nero lost his best counsellor, Burrus; and Seneca had the wisdom to withdraw from the court, where his presence had become disliked, and where his enormous wealth was calculated to excite the envy even of the emperor. About the same time Nero divorced Octavia and married Poppaea, and soon after put to death the former on a false accusation of adultery and treason. In the tenth year of his reign (A.D. 64) Rome was almost destroyed by fire. Of the fourteen districts into which the city was divided, four only remained entire. The fire originated at that part of the Circus which was contiguous to the Palatine and Coelian Hills, and raged with the greatest fury for six days and seven nights; and, after it was thought to have been extinguished, it burst forth again, and continued for two days longer. Nero appears to have acted on this occasion with the greatest liberality and kindness; the city was supplied with provisions at a very moderate price; and the imperial gardens were thrown open to the sufferers, and buildings erected for their accommodation. But these acts of humanity and benevolence were insufficient to screen him from the popular suspicion. It was generally believed that he had set fire to the city himself, and some even reported that he had ascended the top of a high tower in order to witness the conflagration, where he amused himself with singing the “Destruction of Troy.” From many circumstances, however, it appears improbable that Nero was guilty of this crime. His guilt, indeed, is asserted by Suetonius (<bibl n="Suet. Nero 38" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nero</title>, 38</bibl>) and Dio Cassius (lxii. 17), but Tacitus admits that he was not able to prove the truth of the accusation ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 15. 38" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>xv. 38</bibl>). In order, however, to remove the suspicions of the people, Nero spread a report that the Christians were the authors of the fire, and numbers of them, accordingly, were seized and put to death. Their execution served as an amusement to the people. Some were covered with skins of wild beasts, and were torn to pieces by dogs; others were crucified; and several were smeared with pitch and other combustible materials, and burned in the imperial gardens in the night: “Whence,” says the historian, “pity arose 
<pb n="1090" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01090">

</figure>
 for the guilty (though they deserved the severest punishments), since they were put to death, not for the public good, but to gratify the cruelty of a single man” ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xv. 44</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In the following year (A.D. 65) a powerful conspiracy was formed for the purpose of placing Piso upon the throne, but it was discovered by Nero, and the principal conspirators were put to death. Among others who suffered on this occasion were Lucan and Seneca; but the guilt of the latter is doubtful. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossseneca">Seneca</ref>.) In the same year Poppaea died, in consequence of a kick which she received from her husband while she was in an advanced state of pregnancy. A long list of victims is to be found in the pages of the annalists. The distinguished general Domitius Corbulo, Thrasea Paetus, and Barea Soranus are among these.</p>
 <p>During the latter part of his reign, Nero was principally engaged in amateur theatricals, and in contending for the prizes at the public games. He had previously appeared as an actor on the Roman stage; and he now visited in succession the chief cities of Greece, and received no less than 1800 crowns for his victories in the public Grecian games. He also began the canal across the Isthmus of Corinth, but ordered the work to be stopped (Dio Cass. lxiii. 6 foll.), leaving its completion to our own times <bibl default="NO">(1893)</bibl>. On his return to Italy he entered Naples and Rome as a conqueror, and was received with triumphal honours. But while he was engaged in these extravagances, Vindex, who commanded the legions in Gaul, declared against his authority; and his example was speedily followed by Galba, who commanded in Spain. The praetorian cohorts espoused the cause of Galba, <cb /> and the Senate pronounced sentence of death against Nero, who had fled from Rome as soon as he heard of the revolt of the Praetorian Guards. Nero, however, anticipated the execution of the sentence which had been passed against him, by requesting one of his attendants to put him to death, after making an ineffectual attempt to do so with his own hands. He died A.D. 68, in the thirty-second year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, the grandfather of the emperor Nerva. He was consul in A.D. 22, and starved himself to death in the year 33.

 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, the son of the preceding and father of the emperor. He won distinction as a jurist, and is quoted in Gaius and the Digest under the name of Filius. Nerva</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Coccēius</hi>. The thirteenth Roman emperor, was born at Narnia, in Umbria, A.D. 27 according to Eutropius (viii. 1), or A.D. 32 according to Dio Cassius (lxviii. 4). His family originally came from Crete; but several of his ancestors rose to the highest honours of the Roman State. His grandfather, Cocceius Nerva, who was consul A.D. 22, and a great favourite of the emperor Tiberius, was one of the most celebrated jurists of his age. Nerva is first mentioned in history as a favourite of Nero, who bestowed upon him triumphal honours, A.D. 66, when he was praetor elect. The poetry of Nerva , which is mentioned with praise by Pliny and Martial, appears to have recommended him to Nero; and he was employed in offices of trust and honour during the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, though he incurred the suspicion of Domitian, who banished him to Tarentum. On the assassination of Domitian, A.D. 96, Nerva succeeded to the sovereign power, through the influence of Petronius Secundus, commander of the praetorian cohorts, and of Parthenius, the chamberlain of the palace. 
<pb n="1091" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The mild and equitable administration of Nerva is acknowledged and praised by all ancient writers, and forms a striking contrast to the bloody reign of his predecessor. He discouraged informers, recalled the exiles from banishment, relieved the people from some oppressive taxes, and tolerated the Christians. Many instances of his liberality and clemency are recorded by the younger Pliny ; he allowed no senator to be put to death during his reign; and he practised the greatest economy, in order to relieve the wants of the poorer citizens. But his impartial administration of justice met with little favour from the Praetorian Guard, <figure id="fig.01091">
<head orig="Nerva. (Bust in the Vatican.)">Nerva. (Bust in the Vatican.)</head>
</figure> which had been allowed by Domitian to indulge in excesses of every kind. Enraged at the loss of their benefactor and favourite, they compelled Nerva to deliver into their hands Parthenius and their own commander Petronius, both of whom they put to death. The excesses of his guards convinced Nerva that the government of the Roman Empire required greater energy both of body and mind than he possessed, and he accordingly adopted Trajan as his successor, and associated him with himself in the sovereignty. Nerva died A.D. 98, after a reign of sixteen months and nine days. His life is sketched by Suetonius.

<div2 id="crossnestor" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Nestor">Nestor</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νέστωρ</foreign>). Son of Neleus and Chloris, ruler of the Messenian and Triphylian Pylus, and later also, after the extinction of the royal family there, of Messenia. He was married to Eurydicé, by whom he had seven sons and two daughters. He was the only one of twelve sons of Neleus who escaped being slain by Heracles, since he was, it is said, living at the time among the Gerenians in Messenia, from whom he derives the name <foreign lang="greek">Γερήνιος</foreign>, given him in Homer. After this disaster, the king of the Epeans, Augeas, illegally kept back a fourhorse chariot which Neleus had sent to Elis to compete in a contest. Nestor , as yet hardly a youth, retaliated by driving off the herds of the Epeans; upon which the latter with a large army besieged the Pylian fortress of Thyroessa on the Eurotas. Nestor formed one of the relieving army, serving as a foot-soldier, owing to his father's having, from regard to his youth, had the war-horses concealed from him. He slew in battle Augeas's son-in-law, and, fighting from the dead man's chariot, won a most brilliant victory, so that the Pylians offered thanks to him among men just as they offered them to Zeus among the gods. In like manner in the war against the Arcadians, when he was the youngest of all the combatants, he killed the gigantic and much-dreaded hero Ereuthalion. He also took an important part in the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapithae, and is mentioned as among the Argonauts (Val. Flac. i. 380). In old age, when he was ruling over the third generation of his people, he was involved in the expedition against Troy, owing, as the story went, to the obligation incurred by his son Antilochus as a suitor of Helen; with Odysseus he gained the help of Achilles and Patroclus for the undertaking, and himself sailed, in the company of his sons Antilochus and Thrasymedes, with ninety ships to the seat of war at Ilium. Here, according to Homer, “ Nestor the horseman,” in spite of his great age, took a prominent part among the heroes in council and battle alike: the qualities which adorned him 
<pb n="1092" /><cb />
 were wisdom, justice, eloquence, “from his lips flows language sweeter than honey” ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 248" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 248</bibl>), experience in war, unwearied activity, and courage. All valued and loved him, and none more than Agamemhon, who wished that he had ten such counsellors: in which case, he said, Troy would soon fall ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 372" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 372</bibl>). He is so great a favourite with Homer that in ancient times it was conjectured that the poet was himself a native of Pylos. After the destruction of Troy he returned in safety with his son Thrasymedes to Pylos, <ref type="cross" target="crossantilochus">Antilochus</ref> (q.v.) having for the sake of his father, who was in sore peril, sacrificed his own life in battle against Memnon. Ten years afterwards, Telemachus found him still at Pylos, amidst his children, in the enjoyment of a cheerful and prosperous old age.

 <p> also called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Third Academy</hi>. The form which the Academic philosophy of Plato received at the hands of Carneades. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscarneades">Carneades</ref>.) It was largely skeptical in its teaching, denying the possibility of aiming at absolute truth or at any certain criterion of truth. Carneades argued that if there were any such criterion it must exist in reason (<foreign lang="greek">λόγος</foreign>) or sensation (<foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign>) or conception (<foreign lang="greek">φαντασία</foreign>); but as reason depends on conception and this in turn on sensation, and as we have no means of deciding whether our <cb /> sensations really correspond to the objects that produce them, the basis of all knowledge is always uncertain. Hence, all that we can attain to is a high degree of probability, which we must accept as the nearest possible approximation to the truth. The New Academy teaching is in the nature of modern agnosticism, and represents the spirit of an age when religion was decaying, and philosophy itself, losing its earnest and serious spirit, was becoming merely a vehicle for rhetoric and dialectical ingenuity. Cicero's speculative philosophy was in the main in accord with the teachings of Carneades, looking rather to the probable (<seg lang="la">illud probabile</seg>) than to certain truth.

<head orig="Nexum">Nexum</head>

 <p> In the old Roman legal system <seg lang="la">nexum</seg> was the solemn process of entering upon a relationship of debtor and creditor under the form of <seg lang="la">mancipatio</seg> (q. v.). In the formula used therein the borrower gave the lender, in case of non-fulfilment of the obligation incurred, the right to seize him (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossmanus-iniectio">Manus Iniectio</ref>) without more ado as his bondsman, since he stood in the position of a defendant against whom judgment had already been given (<seg lang="la">iudicatus</seg>), or who had admitted his liability in open court (<seg lang="la">in iure confessus</seg>). There was no limit in respect of time to the right of the creditor over a debtor whose person thus became forfeit to him: it consisted in the fact that the creditor could keep the <seg lang="la">nexus</seg> in his private dungeon and make him work as a slave for him. The latter, however, continued to be a citizen; but, as long as the debt existed, was considered dishonoured, and was accordingly excluded from service in the legion and voting in the assemblies of the people. After the Lex Poetilia Papiria of B.C. 326 had, in the interest of the plebeians, for the most part abolished personal security, the <seg lang="la">nexum</seg> gradually passed into a mere contract of loan. Varro defines it as <seg lang="la">quodcumque per aes et libram geritur </seg> (<title>L. L.</title> vii. 105).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νικαία</foreign>). (1) A celebrated city of Asia, situated on the eastern side of Lake Ascania (Isnik) in Bithynia, built (about B.C. 300) by Antigonus, king of Asia, and originally called Antigonea; but Lysimachus soon after changed the name into Nicaea, in honour of his wife. Under the kings of Bithynia it was often the royal residence; and under the Romans it continued to be one of the chief cities of Asia; and at the time of the Byzantine emperors it was a great military outpost of Constantinople against the Turks. It fell in A.D. 1330, 
<pb n="1093" /><cb /> being taken by the Turk Orchan, the son of Ottoman. The great double walls of the ancient city still exist, and there are ruins of an aqueduct, a theatre, a gymnasium, and the two moles of the ancient harbour. It is famous in ecclesiastical history as the seat of the great Oecumenical Council which Constantine convoked in A.D. 325, chiefly for the decision of the Arian controversy, and which drew up the Nicene Creed. See <bibl default="NO">Stanley's <title>History of the Eastern Church</title> (1861)</bibl>. The modern name is Isnik (<foreign lang="greek">εἰς Νίκαιαν</foreign>).</p>

Soon afterwards he surprised the Piraeus also, and placed both fortresses in the hands of Cassander on the arrival of the latter in Attica in 318. Nicanor was afterwards despatched by Cassander with a fleet to the Hellespont, where he gained a victory over the admiral of Polysperchon.

<head orig="Nicias">Nicias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νικίας</foreign>). (1) An Athenian general who was a man of birth and fortune; but one in whom a generous temper, popular manners, and considerable political and military talent were marred by unreasonable diffidence and an excessive dread of responsibility. Nicias, however, signalized himself on several occasions. He took the island of Cythera from the Lacedaemonians, subjugated many cities of Thrace which had revolted from the Athenian sway, shut up the Megarians within their city-walls, cutting off all communications from without, and taking their harbour Nisaea. When the unfortunate expedition against Syracuse was undertaken by Athens, Nicias was one of the three commanders who were sent at its head, the other two being Alcibiades and Lamachus. He had previously, however, used every effort to prevent his countrymen from engaging in this affair, on the ground that they were only wasting their resources in distant warfare and multiplying their enemies. After the recall of Alcibiades, the natural indecision of Nicias, increased by ill-health and dislike of his command, proved a principal cause of the failure of the enterprise. In endeavouring to retreat by land from before Syracuse, the Athenian commanders, Nicias and Demosthenes (the latter had come with re-enforcements), were pursued, defeated, and compelled to surrender. The generals were put to death (B.C. 414); their soldiers were confined at first in the quarry of Epipolae, and afterwards sold as slaves. There is a life of Nicias by Plutarch.</p>
 <p>(2) An Athenian painter, a son of Nicomedes, and a pupil of Euphranor's pupil Antidotus. He lived during the latter half of the fourth century B.C., and was a younger contemporary of Praxiteles. The latter, when asked which of his works in marble he specially approved, was in the habit of answering, “Those that have been touched by the hand of Nicias”—such importance did he attribute to that artist's method of tinting, or “touching up with colour,” <seg lang="la">circumlitio</seg> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 133" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 133</bibl>). He painted mainly in encaustic, and was especially distinguished by his skill in making the figures on his pictures appear to stand out of the work by means of a proper treatment of light and shade. He was celebrated for his painting of female figures and other subjects which were favourable to the full expression of dramatic emotions, such as the rescue of Andromeda and the questioning of the dead by Odysseus in the lower world. This latter picture he presented to the city of his birth, after Ptolemy I. had offered sixty talents (about $60,000) for it (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  130" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 130</bibl>-133). He insisted on the importance of an artist's choosing noble themes, such as cavalry engagements and battles at sea, instead of frittering away his skill on birds and flowers (Demet. <title>De Elocutione</title>, 76).</p>
 <p>(3) The younger, an Athenian painter, son of Nicomedes, and pupil of Euphranor. He began to practise his art about B.C. 320. Nicias is said to have been the first artist who used burnt ochre in his paintings (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 6</bibl><bibl n="Plin.

 <p>(4) The physician of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, who offered to poison that monarch for a sum of money to be paid by the Romans. The Roman general, Fabricius, rejected this offer with scorn, and delivered Nicias over to Pyrrhus ( <bibl n="Gel.  3. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 8</bibl>).

Having learned, however, at last, that Nicocles had formed an alliance with Antigonus, Ptolemy sent two emissaries to Cyprus, with orders to despatch Nicocles in case his treachery should be clearly proved. These persons, having taken with them a party of soldiers, surrounded the palace of the king of Paphos, and compelled him to destroy himself, although he protested his innocence (B.C. 310). His wife Axiothea, when she heard of her husband's death, killed her daughters with her own hand, and then slew herself. The other female relatives followed her example.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νικομήδης</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Nicomēdes I.</hi>, king of Bithynia, was the eldest son of Zipoetes, whom he succeeded, B.C. 278. With the aid of the Gauls, whom he invited into Asia, he defeated and put to death his brother Zipoetes, who had for some time held the independent sovereignty of a considerable part of Bithynia. The rest of his reign appears to have been undisturbed, and under his sway Bithynia rose to a high degree of power and prosperity. He founded the city of Nicomedia, which he made the capital of his kingdom. The length of his reign is uncertain, but he probably died about 250. He was succeeded by his son Zielas.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Nicomēdes II.</hi>, surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossepiphanes">Epiphănes</ref>, king of Bithynia, reigned B.C. 149-91. He was the son and successor of Prusias II., and fourth in descent from the preceding. He was brought up at Rome, where he succeeded in gaining the favour of the Senate. Prusias, in consequence, became jealous of his son, and sent secret instructions for his assassination. The plot was revealed to Nicomedes, who thereupon returned to Asia, and declared open war against his father. Prusias was deserted by his subjects, and was put to death by order of his son, B.C. 149. Of the long and tranquil reign of Nicomedes, few events have been transmitted to us. He courted the friendship of the Romans, whom he assisted in the war against Aristonicus, 131. He subsequently obtained possession of Paphlagonia, and attempted to gain Cappadocia by marrying Laodicé, the widow of Ariarathes VI. He was, however, expelled from Cappadocia by Mithridates; and he was also compelled by the Romans to abandon Paphlagonia, when they deprived Mithridates of Cappadocia.</p>

Immediately after his accession, he was expelled by Mithridates, who set up against him his brother Socrates; but he was restored by the Romans in the following year (90). At the instigation of the Romans, Nicomedes now proceeded to attack the dominions of Mithridates, who expelled him a second time from his kingdom (88). This was the immediate occasion of the First Mithridatic War, at the conclusion of which (84) Nicomedes was again reinstated in his kingdom. He reigned nearly ten years after this second restoration. He died at the beginning of B.C. 74, and, having no children, by his will bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people.</p>

He applied to the hitherto accepted narrative the laws of evidence and the searching methods of historical research, demonstrating that the whole account of the founding and the early regal period is purely mythical and legendary. This demonstration he elaborated more fully in his <title>Römische Geschichte</title>, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1811-32)</bibl>, which carries the story of Rome down to the First Punic War. The negative and destructive part of his work has completely revolutionized the views of Rome's historians, so that all writers now accept the view of Niebuhr in the main as sound; his constructive work, however, has been generally rejected, especially his “epic hypothesis,” which traces the source of the Roman legends to ballads and sagas which he assumes to have existed. Niebuhr inaugurated a new epoch in the study of history by establishing and demonstrating a fundamental difference between legend and history, and his critical methods have been universally adopted as sound.

 <p>Niebuhr's later life was one of great activity. From 1816-22 he served as Prussian ambassador to the papal court at Rome; and in the latter year accepted a call to the chair of History in the University of Bonn. Here he founded the <bibl default="NO"><title>Rheinisches Museum</title> (1827)</bibl>, and took part with Bekker in the publication of the <title>Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae</title>, besides issuing <title>Kleine historische und philologische Schriften</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1828)</bibl>, an edition of Fronto <bibl default="NO">(1816)</bibl>, and <bibl default="NO"><title>Griechische Heroengeschichte</title> (1842)</bibl>. His Roman history has been translated into English by Hare, Thirlwall, and Smith, and a volume of lectures on Roman history appeared in 1850, edited by Leonhard Schmitz. Dr. Schmitz also published English editions of Niebuhr's lectures on ancient history <bibl default="NO">(1852)</bibl>, and on ancient ethnography and geography <bibl default="NO">(1853)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νίγειρ, Νίγιρ</foreign>). A great river of Aethiopia Interior, which modern usage has identified with the river called Joli-ba (i. e.

 <p>A Roman of humble origin, but one whose great military talents recommended him successively to the notice of Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, and Pertinax, by whom he was employed in offices of trust and honour. He was consul together with Septimius Severus, and obtained the government of Syria. On the murder of Pertinax, A.D. 193, the Empire was exposed for sale by the Praetorian Guards, and was purchased by Didius Iulianus, whom the Senate was compelled to acknowledge as emperor. The people, however, did not tamely submit to this indignity, and three generals, at the head of their respective legions—Septimius Severus, who commanded in Pannonia; Clodius Albinus in Britain, and Pescennius Niger in Syria—refused to acknowledge the nomination of the Praetorians, and each claimed the Empire. Of these Niger was the most popular, and his cause was warmly espoused by all the provinces of the East. But instead of hastening to Italy, he quietly remained at Antioch, while Severus marched to Rome, dethroned Didius, and made active preparations for prosecuting the war against Niger in Asia. Roused at length from his inactivity, Niger crossed over to Europe, and established his headquarters at Byzantium; but he had scarcely arrived at this place, before his troops in Asia were defeated near Cyzicus by the generals of Severus. He was soon, however, able to collect another army, which he commanded in person; but, being defeated successively near Nicaea and at Issus, he abandoned his troops and fled towards the Euphrates, with the intention of seeking refuge among the Parthians. Before he could reach the Euphrates, he was overtaken by a detachment of the enemy, and put to death on the spot (Spartian. <title>Vit. Nig.;</title> Eutrop. viii. 10). <cb />

<div2 id="crossnike" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Niké">Nike</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νίκη</foreign>). The Greek goddess of victory, according to Hesiod, daughter of Pallas and Styx, by whom she was brought to Zeus to assist him in his struggle with the Titans; thenceforward she remained always with Zeus on Olympus. She is the sister of Zelos (zeal), Cratos (power), and Bia (force). Sculptors often represent her in connection with divinities who grant victory: thus the Olympian Zeus and the Athené on the Acropolis at Athens held in one hand a statue of Niké. She was generally represented as winged and with a wreath and a palm-branch. As herald of victory she also bore the wand of Hermes. This mode of representing her was adopted for the statues of the goddess specially revered by the Romans under the name Victoria. Vica Pota (“Victorious Issue”) was an earlier designation of the same goddess. Such statues were erected chiefly on the Capitol by triumphant generals. The most famous was the statue, brought from Tarentum and therefore probably the work of a Greek artist, which Augustus dedicated to her in the Curia Iulia, in memory of his victory at Actium. When the Curia Iulia had been destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus and rebuilt by Domitian, the statue was placed in the new building, and was adored as the guardian goddess of the Senate until Christianity became the religion of the Empire. Athené was also styled Niké as giving victory, and the Niké Apteros or Wingless Victory, to whom the famous temple at Athens was built <bibl default="NO">(see illustration on p. 1097)</bibl>, was Athené, she being thus distinguished from Niké proper, who was conventionally represented with wings.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νεῖλος</foreign>). The Nile, a great river of Egypt. The name is probably cognate with the Semitic <title>Nahar</title> or <title>Nahal</title>, “river.” Homer calls it <foreign lang="greek">Αἴγυπτος</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 477" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 477</bibl>); and the name <foreign lang="greek">Νεῖλος</foreign> occurs first in Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 338) and Hecataeus (<title>Frag.</title> 279). The Jews called it Nahal-Misraim, “River of Egypt.” The Nile takes its rise in the two lakes Victoria Nyanza and Albert Nyanza, which are themselves fed by various streams. For three hundred miles after leaving the former, it flows with a swift current in rapids and cataracts and between high walls of rock. It leaves the northern end of Lake Albert Nyanza, where it is known as the Bahr-el-Jebel, and flows in a northerly course towards the Mediterranean Sea. The first six score miles are through a level country, then for another equal distance is contracted into a narrow stream (in places not more than a quarter of a mile in width), and then, being forced over the Yarbovah Rapids, it enters the plains and flows in a sluggish stream to Khartoum, distant some 800 miles.

At Khartoum (15° 37' north latitude) the White Nile and the Blue Nile (Bahr-el-Azrak) unite, and the great stream then flows on, taking up the Black Nile (Bahr-elAswad), whose black sediment makes the Delta so remarkable for its fertility. The point of junction is the apex of the island Meroë, where the river has a breadth of two miles. Thence it flows through <figure id="fig.01097.2">

 <p>The Nile emptied into the Mediterranean by three channels, parted into seven, of which, according to Herodotus, two were artificial and five natural. From these seven channels come the names applied to it by Moschus (<foreign lang="greek">ἑπτάπορος</foreign>), Catullus (<seg lang="la">septemgeminus</seg>), and Ovid (<hi rend="italic">septemplex</hi>). Most of the seven mouths had names derived from their cities (i. e. 
<pb n="1098" /><cb /> the Canopic, Bolbitic, Sebennytic, Pathmetic or Bucolic, Mendesian, Tanitic or Saïtic, and Pelusiac). At the present time there are only two principal mouths, known as the Rosetta on the west and the Damiat on the east. From the dark sediment deposited by the river came the native name of Egypt—Chemi or Kemi, “the black land.” A great artificial canal (Bahr-Yussouf, i. e. “Joseph's Canal”) runs parallel to the river, at the distance of about six miles, from Diospolis Parva in the Thebais to a point on the west mouth of the river about half-way between Memphis and the sea. Many smaller canals were cut to regulate the irrigation of the country A canal from the east mouth of the Nile to the head of the Red Sea was commenced under the native kings, and finished by Darius, son of Hystaspes. There were several lakes in the country, respecting which see <ref type="cross" target="crossbuto">Buto</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossmareotis">Mareotis</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossmoeris">Moeris</ref>, Sirbonis, and <ref type="cross" target="crosstanis">Tanis</ref>. For the use of the Nile in irrigation, see <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref>, p. 24.</p>
 <p>The ancients knew little of the Nile beyond the First Cataract at Meroë. It was generally believed that the great river originated in Mauretania and flowed for a long distance underground until it <figure id="fig.01098">
<head orig="The God of the Nile. (Vatican.)">The God of the Nile. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> came to the southern part of Aethiopia, whence it flowed northward as the Astapas. The emperor Nero undertook to discover its sources, and sent out two expeditions for that purpose, which succeeded only in reaching the confluence of the Sobat and the White Nile, some thirty miles beyond the junction of the White Nile with the Bahr-el-Zereb. Ptolemy, however, speaks of the river as issuing from two great lakes six and seven degrees respectively south of the equator, and fed by the melting snows of the Mountains of the Moon, lately identified by Stanley with Gordon Bennett, Ruwenzovi, and adjacent peaks. This is about as much as any one had learned until the present century, when the discoveries of Speke <bibl default="NO">(1858 and 1862)</bibl>, Baker <bibl default="NO">(1864)</bibl>, Schweinfurth <bibl default="NO">(1868-71)</bibl>, and Stanley <bibl default="NO">(1875 and 1889)</bibl> solved bit by bit the mystery of the ages.</p>
 <p>The Nile was deified by the Egyptians and worshipped as a god. A famous statue in the Vatican at Rome represents the river deity as a reclining figure pillowed on a sphinx and holding a cornucopia (typical of the fertility caused by the river's overflow), while sixteen children, representing the <cb /> affluents of the Nile, play about. The work belongs to the Graeco-Egyptian period.</p>

The name is perhaps derived from the Assyrian <hi rend="italic">nûnu</hi>, “fish.” Nineveh, the capital of the great Assyrian monarchy, standing on the eastern side of the Tigris, at the upper part of its course, in the district of Aturia. The prophet Jonah (B.C. 825) describes it as “an exceeding great city, of three days' journey,” and as containing “more than 120,000 persons that cannot discern between their right and their left hand,” which, if this phrase refer to children, would represent a population of 600,000 souls. Diodorus also describes it as an oblong quadrangle of 150 stadia by 90, making the circuit of the walls 480 stadia (more than fifty-five miles); if so, the city was nearly twice as large as London, with its suburbs. In judging of these statements, not only must allowance be made for the immense space occupied by palaces and temples, but also for the Oriental mode of building a city, so as to include large gardens and other open spaces within the walls. The walls of Nineveh are described as 100 feet high, and thick enough to allow three chariots to pass each other on them; with 1500 towers, 200 feet in height. The city is said to have been entirely destroyed by fire when it was taken by the Medes and Babylonians, about B.C. 606; and frequent allusions occur to its desolate state. Under the Roman Empire, however, we again meet with a city Nineva, in the district of Adiabené; but this must have been some later place built among or near the ruins of the ancient Nineveh. 
<pb n="1099" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Of all the great cities of the world, none was long thought to have been more utterly lost than the capital of the most ancient of the great monarchies. Tradition pointed out a few shapeless mounds opposite Mosul on the Upper Tigris as all that remained of Nineveh; but within the last fifty years, especially since 1870, those shapeless mounds have been shown to contain the remains of great palaces. The excavations conducted by Layard, Botta, and Smith have brought to light the sculptured remains of immense palaces, not only at the traditional site of Nineveh, namely, Kouyunjik and Nebbi-Younus, opposite to Mosul, and at Khorsabad, about ten miles to the northeast, but also in a mound, eighteen miles lower down the river, in the tongue of land between the Tigris and the Great Zab, which still bears the name of Nimroud. Which of these ruins corresponds to the true site of Nineveh, or whether that vast city may have extended all the way along the Tigris from Kouyunjik to Nimroud and to a corresponding breadth northeast of the river as far as Khorsabad, are questions still under discussion. Some splendid fragments of sculpture, obtained by Layard from Nimroud, are now to be seen in the British Museum. The moat and wall of the city are still discernible, and their ruined temples, a palace built by Shalmaneser I. and destroyed by Sennacherib, a palace of Tiglath-Pileser III. (B.C. 745-727), a palace built by Shalmaneser I. <bibl default="NO">(B.C. 1320)</bibl>, a temple of Nebo, and palaces of Ramman-Nirari and Sennacherib, are among the buildings buried in the vast mound.

<head orig="Niŏbé">Niobe</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νιόβη</foreign>). The daughter of Tantalus and Dioné. She was the sister of Pelops and wife of Amphion of Thebes. Like her father, she stood in close connection with the gods, especially with Leto, the wife of Zeus, and fell into misfortune by her own arrogance. In her maternal pride for her numerous progeny of six sons and six daughters, the ill-fated woman ventured to compare herself to Leto, who had only two children. To punish this presumption Apollo and Artemis slew with their arrows all Niobé's children in their parents' palace. For nine days they lay in their blood without any one to bury them, for Zeus had changed all people into stone. On the tenth day the gods buried them. Niobé, who was changed to stone on the lonely hills of Sipylus, could not, even in this form, forget her sorrow. So runs Homer's account ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24. 612" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiv. 612</bibl>), in which we have the earliest reference to “a colossal relief roughly carved on the rocks” of Mount Sipylus, in Lydia, the face of which is washed by a stream in such a manner that it appears to be weeping (cf. Jebb on <title>Antig.</title> 831). Pausanias (i. 21, 5) declares that he saw this relief which modern archaeologists now regard as referable to the art of the Hittites.</p>
 <p>The accounts of later writers vary greatly in respect of the number of the daughters of Niobé and of the scene of her death. Sometimes the spot where the disaster occurs is Lydia, sometimes Thebes, where, moreover, the grave of Niobé's children was pointed out; the sons perish in the chase, or on the race-course, while the daughters die in the royal palace at Thebes, or at the <cb /> <figure id="fig.01099">

</figure> burial of their brethren. This story describes Niobé as returning from Thebes to her home on Sipylus, and as there changed into a stone by Zeus, at her own entreaty. The fate of Niobé was often, in ancient times, the theme both of poetry and of art. The group of the children of Niobé, discovered at Rome, near the Lateran Church, in 1583, and now <bibl default="NO">(since 1775)</bibl> at Florence, is well known; it is probably the Roman copy of a Greek work which stood in Pliny 's time in a temple of Apollo at Rome, and with regard to which it was a mooted point with the ancients whether it was from the hand of Scopas or of Praxiteles (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

In the war waged by Minos, king of Crete, against the Athenians, on account of the death of Androgeus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossandrogeos">Androgeus</ref>), Megara was besieged, and it was taken through the treachery of Scylla, the daughter of Nisus. This prince had a golden or purple lock of hair growing on his head, and as long as it remained uncut, so long was his life to last. Scylla, having seen Minos, fell in love with him, and resolved to give him the victory. She cut off her father's precious lock as he slept, and he immediately died; the town was then taken by the Cretans. But Minos, instead of rewarding the maiden, disgusted with her unnatural treachery, tied her by the feet to the stern of his vessel, and thus dragged her along until she was drowned ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.15.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.15.1</bibl>).

<head orig="Nitōcris">Nitocris</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νίτωκρις</foreign>). (1) A queen of Babylon, generally supposed to have been the wife of Nebuchodonosor or Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 604-562), and grandmother, consequently, to Labynetus or Nabonedus, who is called in Daniel Belshatzar or Beltzasar. Wesseling, however, and others make her the queen of Evilmerodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar. Herodotus informs us that Nitocris, in order to render her territories more secure from the Medes, altered the course of the Euphrates, and made it so very winding that it came, in its course, three times to Ardericca. She also faced the banks of the Euphrates, where it passed through Babylon, with burned bricks, and connected the two divisions of the city by a bridge of stone ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 186" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 186</bibl>). The historian likewise informs us that she prepared a sepulchre for herself over the most frequented gate of the city, with an inscription to this effect: that if any of her successors should find himself in want of money, he <cb /> should open this sepulchre and take as much as he might think fit; but that, if he were not reduced to real want, he ought to forbear; otherwise he would have cause to repent. This monument remained untouched till the reign of Darius, who, judging it unreasonable that the gate should remain useless to the inhabitants (for no man would pass under a dead body), and that an inviting treasure, moreover, should be rendered unserviceable, broke open the sepulchre; but, instead of money, he found only the remains of Nitocris, and the following inscription: “Hadst thou not been insatiably covetous, and greedy after the most sordid gain, thou wouldst not have violated the sepulchres of the dead” ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 187" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 187</bibl>).

She then destroyed herself ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 100" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 100</bibl>).

 <p> The aristocracy of office, which, at Rome, took the place of the patrician aristocracy of birth, after the admission of the plebeians to all the offices of State and the levelling of the distinction between patricians and plebeians consequent thereon. It comprised those patrician and plebeian families whose members had held one of the curule magistracies. These families, for the most part the most illustrious and wealthy, had the influence and money, which afforded them the 
<pb n="1101" /><cb />
 necessary means to canvass for and hold an office. Thus, in spite of the theoretical equality of rights now existing, they almost completely excluded from the higher magistracies all citizens who had neither wealth nor noble relatives to support them. It was quite exceptional for a man who did not belong to the nobility to be fortunate enough to attain to them. If he did so, he was styled a <seg lang="la">novus homo</seg> (“new man,” “parvenu”), and his condition <seg lang="la">novitas.</seg> It was one of the privileges of the nobility that they enjoyed the right (<seg lang="la">ius imaginum</seg>) to possess images of their ancestors, and this was the chief external distinction between the <seg lang="la">nobiles</seg> and the <seg lang="la">ignobiles.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossimagines">Imagines</ref>.

 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossnomen" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Nomen">Nomen</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα</foreign>). <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. The Greeks had no names denoting family, and so corresponding to modern surnames (Pausan. vii. 7, 4). Hence the name of the new-born child was left to the free choice of the parents, like the Christian name with us. The child usually received it on the tenth day (<foreign lang="greek">δεκάτη</foreign>) after birth, the occasion being a family festival. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphidromia">Amphidromia</ref>.) According to the most ancient custom, the son, especially the first-born, received the name of his grandfather, sometimes that of his father, or a name derived from it (Phocus=Phocion) or similarly compounded (Theophrastus=Theodorus). Girls, in like manner, received the name of the grandmother (Isae. <title>De Pyrrh. Herod.</title> 30). As a rule, a Greek had only one name, to which was added that of his father, to prevent confusion— e. g. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκιβιάδης ὁ</foreign> (sc. the son) <foreign lang="greek">Κλεινίου</foreign>. Sometimes, also, the name of the country was added in the form of an adjective—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης ὁ Ἀθηναῖος</foreign>. A great many names were compounded with the names of gods (Heracleitus, Herodotus, Artemidorus, Diogenes), or derived from them (Demetrius, Apollonius). Frequently names of good omen for the future of the child were chosen. Sometimes a new name was afterwards substituted <cb /> for the original one; so Plato was originally called Aristocles, and Theophrastus, Tyrtamus. Slaves were usually called after their native country, or their physical or moral peculiarities. See Becker-Göll, <title>Charikles</title>, ii. p. 26.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>. The development of the Roman name was co-ordinate with the growth and development of the Roman State. In the early period, when, in the small community, the individual was all-important, the strictly personal name was prominent; but as the community increased in size and consequence, added importance was given to certain determinatives, which marked the individual as a member of society and distinguished him from his fellows. These determinatives probably belonged to the name in its early history, notwithstanding the statement, <title>Varro simplicia in Italia nomina fuisse ait</title>, found in the fragment <title>De Praenominibus</title>, assigned to Valerius Maximus by Julius Paris of the fourth century. This statement is there supported by reference to Romulus and Remus, names belonging to a mythology of late origin, but is controverted by reference to Rhea Silvia and Silvius Numitor. The first of these early determinatives was the word, indicating <seg lang="la">potestas, manus, mancipium</seg>, in the genitive case—e. g. Marcus Marci, Caecilia Crassi—followed later, as shown in the inscriptions, by <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ilius</hi>) or <seg lang="la">f(ilia), uxor</seg>, or <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ervus</hi>). The second early determinative was the word indicating the family (<seg lang="la">gens</seg>) distinguished from the other elements by the suffix -<seg lang="la">ius.</seg> Thus the three elements of the early name were the individual name, the name of the one in authority, and the name of the family. Among the Romans the order of the last two was reversed, while among the Greeks, Umbrians, and Volscians the original order was maintained.</p>
 <p>In the course of time the necessity of still further identifying the individual led to the use of other elements, the name of the tribe and the <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg>, an additional personal name. The latter afterwards came to indicate the branch or family, <seg lang="la">stirps</seg>, of the <seg lang="la">gens.</seg> The name of a free-born citizen then consisted of a <seg lang="la">praenomen, nomen, cognomen</seg>, with the insertion in formal usage, before the <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg>, of the words denoting filiation and descent, followed by <seg lang="la">filius, nepos, pronepos, abnepos, adnepos</seg>, and of the name of the tribe. The order indicated—<seg lang="la">praenomen, nomen, cognomen</seg>—is violated in the inscriptions only for metrical reasons, or because of Greek influence or rustic usage. In literature the same order is observed in prose of the good period, even in Livy , when the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> is given; but if the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> is omitted the older order, that followed by Cicero, is <seg lang="la">cognomen, nomen;</seg> while the later order, that followed by Caesar, is <seg lang="la">nomen, cognomen.</seg> In social intercourse children, clients, slaves, addressed the master of the house by his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>, while strangers used his <seg lang="la">cognomen.</seg> In more formal address both <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> and <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> were employed.</p>
 <p><title>Praenomen.</title>—The strictly personal name was conferred by parents upon their children on the <seg lang="la">dies lustricus</seg>, the ninth day after birth in case of boys and the eighth in case of girls. The assertion of Q. Scaevola, as given in <title>De Praenominibus</title>, to the effect that boys did not receive the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> until they assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>, or girls before their marriage, must refer to the formal conferring of the name, for the inscriptions of persons dying in childhood often contain the <seg lang="la">praenomina.</seg> 
<pb n="1102" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Eighteen <seg lang="la">praenomina</seg> were employed by the patrician families: A. , Aulus; D., Decimus; C., Gaius ; CN., Gnaeus; K., Kaeso; L., Lucius; M'., Manius; M., Marcus; P., Publius; Q., Quintus; SER., Servius; SEX., Sextus; S., Spurius; TI., Tiberius; T., Titus; AP., Appius; MAM., Mamercus; N., Numerius. Certain of these were selected by the individual patrician families; thus, the Cornelii used A. , CN., L., M., P., SER., TI.; but the Cornelii Scipiones, CN., L., P. (see table given by Momm. <title>Röm. Forschungen</title>, p. 15). Other <seg lang="la">praenomina</seg> were employed, some of which fell into disuse at an early period, and are known from the <seg lang="la">fasti</seg> or from statements of authors, while others were of foreign origin and rare occurrence. Varro, in <title>De Praenom.</title> 3, names fourteen ancient <seg lang="la">praenomina</seg> not used at his time: Agrippa, Ancus, Caesar, Faustus, Hostus, Lar, Opiter, Postumus, Proculus, Sertor, Statius, Tullus, Volero, Vopiscus.</p>
 <p><title>Cognomina</title> were used at times as <seg lang="la">praenomina</seg>, particularly in Gallia Cisalpina—e. g. Maximus, Rufus; also in the imperial family in the employment of such names as Cossus, Drusus, and Germanicus. The word <seg lang="la">imperator</seg> in the time of Augustus became a <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> in the imperial name. <title>Nomina</title> also served as <seg lang="la">praenomina</seg>—e. g. Aelius, Aurelius—after the middle of the second century, and even suffered abbreviation.</p>
 <p><title>Nomen.</title>—The second determinative in the early Roman name belonged to all members of the same family, and was at first identified with a certain locality. The <seg lang="la">nomina</seg> of the old Roman families ended in -<seg lang="la">ius</seg> and the closely related terminations -<title>aius, -eius, -eus, -aeus. Nomina</title> with other terminations may be assigned to the localities to which they originally belonged—e. g. -<seg lang="la">arna, -erna, -enna, -ina, -inna</seg> show Etruscan origin, while -<seg lang="la">as, -anas, -enas, -inas</seg> testify to Umbrian derivation. Other <seg lang="la">nomina</seg> are directly derived from names of places —e. g. Acerranus (<title>Acerrae</title>); Verres, of Roman origin, stands by itself, and may have been originally a <seg lang="la">cognomen.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Cognomen.</title>—This last addition to the Roman name was first used as a strictly personal name employed as appropriate to the individual—e. g. Albus, Barbatus, Severus, Siculus. The position of the <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> after the name of the tribe indicates a time of introduction subsequent to the Servian Constitution; and judging from its use in inscriptions the custom of writing <seg lang="la">cognomina</seg> dates back to the fifth century of the city, while its regular use may be assigned to the latter part of the seventh century. The <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> afterwards served as an indication of the family of the <seg lang="la">gens</seg>, so of the <title>gens Cornelii</title> there were the Cethegi, Lentuli, Scipiones, while of the Scipiones there were the Nasicae; also as an indication of nobility, being employed by patrician families and certain of the plebeian. In the late republican period the <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> was given to all free-born citizens and frequently to freedmen, and at this time served as an indication of freedom. The custom of using more than one <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> became very common in the early days of the Empire, and prevailed generally in the second and third centuries. These additional <seg lang="la">cognomina</seg> were regarded by the grammarians after the fourth century as new elements, and were termed by them <seg lang="la">agnomina.</seg> Of this class were the <seg lang="la">cognomina ex virtute</seg>—e. g. Caudinus, Hispanus—and names, indicating the parentage of those adopted, made with the termination -<seg lang="la">anus</seg>—e. g. Aemilianus. <cb /></p>
 <p><title>Names of Women.</title>—The names of women in the early period consisted of an individual name, <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>, followed by the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> of the father and the genitive case of his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>, or by the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> of the husband and the genitive case of his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>—e. g. Maior Anicia C. f(ilia). Subsequently the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> disappeared, and the female name consisted of merely the <seg lang="la">nomen gentile</seg> of the father or husband alone—e. g. Aemilia, or accompanied, when more formal, by the genitive of the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> of the father or husband—e. g. Acilia C. f(ilia); cf. also Curtia Rosci (uxor). At the close of the Republic <seg lang="la">cognomina</seg> were used with names of women —e. g. Caecilia Metella; and from the middle of the first century the custom prevailed generally —e. g. Furia Sabinia Tranquillina.</p>
 <p><title>Names of Slaves.</title>—The name of the slave originally consisted simply of the name of his master in combination with the word <seg lang="la">puer;</seg> as, Marcipor= <title>Marci puer.</title> In the republican period the slave was known by an individual name, often of foreign origin, followed by the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> and afterwards the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> of his master, both in the genitive case. His servile condition was indicated by the word <seg lang="la">servus</seg>, abbreviated in the inscriptions S. or SER. Thus, Helenus Hosti Q. s.=Helenus, slave of Quintus Hostius. In the imperial period the name of the owner is given in full—as, Martialis C. Oli(i) Primi s(ervus). The transfer of a slave to a new master was indicated by the use of an additional name, made from the <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> of his former master, with termination -<seg lang="la">anus</seg>—e. g. Epitynchanus Caes(aris) n(ostri) ser(vus) Candidian(us).</p>
 <p><title>Names of Freedmen.</title>—Originally the freedman received the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> of his <hi rend="italic">patron</hi>, and selected his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>, which might be his early servile name. His former state was indicated, as shown in the inscriptions, by the word <seg lang="la">servus</seg>, following the genitive case of his patron's <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>—e. g. C. Sextius V(ibi) s(ervus). In the seventh century of the city a freedman received his patron's <seg lang="la">nomen</seg>, a Roman <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> (regularly that of his master), and used his former slave name as a <seg lang="la">cognomen.</seg> His former state was indicated, as shown in the inscriptions, by the word <seg lang="la">libertus</seg>, abbreviated L. or LIB. —e. g. P. Helvidius P. l. Hermes. When freedmen were liberated by the emperor, the expression Aug(usti) l(ibertus) or Caes(aris) n(ostri) l(ibertus) took the place of the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> of the patron. Freedmen of women took the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> of their patroness and the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> of her father—e. g. M. Livius Aug(ustae) l(ibertus) Menophilus. Freedmen of a <seg lang="la">colonia</seg> or <seg lang="la">municipium</seg> formed <seg lang="la">nomina</seg> out of the word <seg lang="la">publicus</seg>, since they had been <seg lang="la">servi publici</seg>, or from the name of the <seg lang="la">colonia</seg> or <seg lang="la">municipium.</seg></p>

 <p><ref type="cross" target="crossnicknames">Nicknames</ref>.—Nicknames were freely given by both the Greeks and Romans, based upon any bodily or mental defect or peculiarity, or upon some well-known circumstance of the individual's career. Thus Demosthenes, from his childhood, was called <foreign lang="greek">Βάτταλος</foreign>, because of his stuttering ( <title>C. Timarch.</title> 126, 141); and Aristophanes 
<pb n="1103" /><cb />
 gives several names of birds that were used as nicknames ( <bibl n="Dionys. Av. 1291" default="NO"> <title>Av.</title>1291</bibl>). Dionysius of Heraclea was popularly styled <foreign lang="greek">Μεταθέμενος</foreign>, or “turn-coat,” from his abandonment of the Stoic philosophy; and Hegesias of Cyrené got the name of <foreign lang="greek">Πεισιθάνατος</foreign>, or “Death's Advocate,” from his gloomy view of life. Epicrates was styled <foreign lang="greek">Σακεσφορός</foreign>, from his large beard; and one of the Ptolemies <foreign lang="greek">Φύσκων</foreign>, from his paunch.

 <p>As already shown, many of the Roman family names were originally nicknames; as, Naso, “bignose”; Flaccus, “flop-ear”; Varus, “bandy-legs”; and Scaurus, “knock-kneed.” The Rufi were named from a red-headed ancestor; and the name Cicero is said to have been due to a wart like a pea (<seg lang="la">cicer</seg>) on the face. Some of the nicknames were accepted by their subjects as formal names, and hence passed into history, as Cunctator (“slow-coach”) and Caligula. The last emperor of the West, Romulus Augustus, was, because of his insignificance, styled Augustulus, just as Victor Hugo dubbed the Third Napoleon, <title>Napoléon le Petit.</title> Pompey was nicknamed “Sampsiceramus” by Cicero, after a petty prince of Emesa ( <title>Ad Att.</title> ii. 14, 16). The bibulous tastes of Tiberius led the people to change his name from Tiberius Claudius Nero to Biberius Caldius Mero (from <seg lang="la">bibo, calda</seg>, and <seg lang="la">merum</seg>). Sometimes a whole phrase was applied as a nickname, as <title>Cedo alteram</title> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 23</bibl><bibl n="Tac.

 <p> (<seg lang="la">nomenculator</seg>). A sort of usher; a slave kept by great personages, whose business it was to make himself acquainted with the names and persons of every one who was in the habit of attending his master's levees, so that when the great man met any of them out of doors, the nomenclator, who accompanied him, announced their names, and enabled him to address them personally, or pay them some little appropriate compliment; for to pass a client without notice, even inadvertently, might be regarded as an affront, and possibly be resented at the next elections ( <title>Ad Att.</title> iv. 1; <title>Epist.</title> i. 6, 50-52). In great houses, where the acquaintances and hangers-on were very numerous, the nomenclator arranged the order of precedence among the guests, announced the name of each dish as it was served up, and enumerated its peculiar excellences (Pet. <bibl n="Enn.

<head orig="Nomos">Nomos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>). (1) Originally an ancient kind of solo in epic form in praise of some divinity. It was either “aulodic” or “citharodic”—that is, it was sung to the accompaniment of the flute or the cithara. The citharodic nomos was from ancient times used at the festivals of Apollo, whom the Dorians especially worshipped. It received its artistic form from Terpander (about B.C. 675) principally by a systematic distribution into five or seven parts, of which three were the essential portions, the middle one forming the cardinal point of the whole. It formed an important element in the Delphian festival of the Pythian Apollo. On the other hand, the aulodic nomos, which Clonas of Tegea had introduced in imitation of the nomos of Terpander, was early excluded from this festival. By the side of the ancient nomoi, in which the words were sung to an instrumental accompaniment, there arose another variety formed on the same model. In this the song was dramatically recited to the tune of the flute or cithara, according as the nomos was “aulodic” or “citharodic.” Of the former kind was the nomos introduced by the flute-player Sacadas of Argos (about B.C. 580) at the Pythian Games, and hence called the <title>Pythian nomos</title>, a musical representation of the destruction of the dragon Pytho by Apollo. At a later period the province of the nomos was more and more extended and secularized, until it became the most important part of the musician's profession.

The inhabitants of the country were Kelts, divided into several tribes, of which the Taurisci, also called Norici, after their capital Noreia, were the most important. They were conquered by the Romans in the reign of Augustus, after the subjugation of Rhaetia by Tiberius and Drusus, and their country was formed into a Roman province.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα</foreign>). A word used technically of signs and abbreviations, as (1) for secret writing, cipher;</p>
 <p>(2) for rapid writing, short-hand, stenography; and</p>
 <p>(3) for critical purposes in texts (<foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα κριτικά</foreign>).</p>
 <p>I. There is no mention of cryptography, properly so called, among the Greeks of the classical period, though they had various devices for concealing a written message and making it unintelligible except to the person for whose eyes it was intended. Among such devices was the <foreign lang="greek">σκυτάλη</foreign>, mentioned by Plutarch as in use among the Spartans, and of which an account is given in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossscytale">Scytalé</ref>. At Rome towards the end of the Republican period we find mention of cipher writing, though it was of a simple sort and one that would not long baffle the scrutiny of an ingenious investigator. Thus, we are told of Caesar's private correspondence, that he had an agreement with the persons to whom he was writing by which the letters of the words were to be interchanged. Suetonius says that this system consisted in making D stand for A, E for B, and so on through the alphabet, and that Augustus used a similar system ( <title>Iul.</title> 56; <bibl n="Cic. Aug. 88" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>88</bibl>; Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, i. 62).</p>
 <p>II. Whether the use of short-hand arose first 
<pb n="1105" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01105">
<head orig="Specimen of Roman Notae. (From MS. in the Vatican Library.)">Specimen of Roman Notae. (From MS. in the Vatican Library.)</head>
</figure>
 among the Greeks or among the Romans there is no definite information. A passage in Diogenes Laertius (ii. 48) seems to imply that Xenophon took down lectures by some stenographic process, but there is no direct mention of it earlier than the time of Cicero, who employed it frequently, as we learn from Plutarch (<title>Cat. Min.</title> 23) and others. Thus, at the trial of the Catilinarian conspirators, Cato 's speech was taken down by writers whom Cicero had instructed “to use certain signs which in small and brief characters comprehended the force of many letters. . . . For the Romans at that time were not accustomed to employ and did not possess what are known as short-hand writers, but it is said that it was on this occasion that they first conceived the idea.” Dio Cassius (lv. 7) ascribes the invention of the art to Maecenas, but this probably means that Maecenas made some improvements in the existing system. An explanation is given by Isidorus, who ascribes the invention of short-hand to one Ennius (not the poet), who is said to have used 1100 signs. He also says that Tiro , the confidential freedman and secretary of Cicero, was the first person to use these signs at Rome, but implies that this short-hand consisted of abbreviations or arbitrary signs only for particles of frequent occurrence, and that additional signs were added successively by Vipsa<figure id="fig.01105.2">
<head orig="Greek Notae.">Greek Notae.</head>
</figure> nius, Philargyrus, and Aquila, the freedmen of Maecenas, until finally Seneca reduced the whole to a regular system and increased the number of signs to about 5000. It is probable, however, from what Cicero says (<title>Ad Fam.</title> xvi. 4), that the main structure of the system is due to Tiro , and in fact the traditional name for short-hand signs (<title>notae Tironianae</title>) seems to justify this belief (cf. <bibl n="Gel.  6.3.8" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.vi.3.8</bibl>). However this may be, from the time of Cicero and his immediate successors the use of stenography spread among the Romans. It was used both for taking down public speeches and for the use of students in the lecture-room, and many Romans kept slaves who were trained as short-hand writers (<seg lang="la">notarii</seg>). The emperor Titus was a skilful stenographer, and often instituted contests in rapid writing with his secretaries ( <bibl n="Suet. Tit. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tit.</title>3</bibl>). After the Christian era began, short-hand was much used among the Christians for taking down sermons and ecclesiastical speeches, and St. Augustine (<title>Epist.</title> 141) speaks of an episcopal assemblage held at Carthage at which eight stenographers <cb /> were employed in relays of two. Such ancient manuscripts as are written in the Tironian shorthand remained undecipherable until 1747, when the French scholar Charpentier succeeded in reading them and published an account of them.</p>
 <p>The ancient system consisted first of an alphabet more cursive than the ordinary Roman alphabet and especially modified so as to facilitate the juncture of letters. In the second place, it represented terminations by arbitrary characters used in conjunction with a point—thus, B. stood for <hi rend="italic">bam</hi> and .B for <seg lang="la">bant.</seg> In the third place, all sorts of abbreviations (<seg lang="la">sigla</seg>) independently of the character used were employed. Finally, as in modern stenography, a number of arbitrary signs were employed for words in common use.</p>
 <p>III. The Alexandrian grammarians appear to have originated the use of critical signs by which to indicate certain judgments in their recension and study of texts. Aristophanes of Byzantium (B.C. 257-180) published an edition of Homer with such signs, and these were developed by his successors, especially Aristarchus. The most important of these were the <seg lang="la">obelus</seg>, <figure />, used to denote a spurious passage; the <hi rend="italic">diplé</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διπλῆ</foreign>), <figure />, used to call attention to something special; the <hi rend="italic">dotted diplé</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διπλῆ περιεστιγμένη</foreign>), <figure />, to denote variant readings; the <hi rend="italic">asterisk</hi>, *, to mark genuine verses if repeated; the <seg lang="la">antisigma</seg>, <hi rend="bold">C</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">stigmé</hi>, <figure />, both used to denote repetitions of the same idea; the <hi rend="italic">ceraunion</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">κεραύνιον</foreign>), used when a large number of lines were to be rejected.

 <p> Fiction in its origin is with difficulty separated from myth—myth, however, being unconscious and due to a desire to give concrete form to various beliefs that spring up in the primitive mind; while fiction, as a literary motive, originates in a desire to amuse and occasionally to instruct. Hence, the earliest form of fiction is the Beast Fable, which is found in every quarter of the earth and at every period of history. A papyrus dating from B.C. 1200 gives an Egyptian version of the Aesopic fable of the Lion and Mouse; the inscribed Babylonian bricks afford examples of the same thing, and the Hindus probably originated most of the fables which Aesop, Babrius, and Phaedrus made popular in Europe. Akin to conscious fiction and at the same time allied to myth are the folk-tales of nymphs, satyrs, ghosts, fairies, demons, and vampires which Greeks and Romans alike propagated, but which have nearly all been lost to us because they seemed to the ancients unworthy of preservation in formal literature; so that we have now only here and there tantalizing half-glimpses and vanishing suggestions of the curious and fascinating legends told by the common people. Such bits as remain, however, are quite sufficient to prove the existence of a great unwritten literature, and examples of these may still be found, though no longer preserved in their original simplicity, in the stories of the love of Echo for Narcissus, the legend of Hylas and the Naiads, of Cupid and Psyché, and in the various allusions to the monsters known as the Lamiae, Mormolycé, Incubus, and Empusa, the spectre with the brazen leg and the ass's hoof. Ghosts figure in Greek literature <cb /> as early as Homer, and are introduced with striking effect in the <title>Odyssey</title>, as also by the Romans Attius and Vergil, and in the famous story preserved by Pliny the Younger. To this informal fiction belong also the tales of the Lares and the Larvae.</p>
 <p>The earliest form of literary prose fiction, however, is to be found in the short stories collected by Herodotus, most of which have their origin in the East, the home of storytelling. Such are the famous anecdotes of Candaules (i. 8-12), of Arion and the Dolphin (i. 24), of Rhampsinitus and the Robber (ii. 121), and of Polycrates and the Ring (iii. 39), all being admirable instances of the short story in its earliest form—brief, simple, and embodying a single incident.</p>
 <p>Of a more formal type are the so-called Milesian Tales (<foreign lang="greek">Μιλησιακά</foreign>), a generic term for the short anecdotes which were produced in great numbers in the luxurious cities of Asia Minor prior to the second century B.C., and first ascribed to one Aristides, who is said to have written six books of them. No actual examples are known to exist, though their nature may be judged of by the short stories found in later writers, especially Petronius, from which it would appear that they were very much like the stories told in the <title>Decameron</title> of Boccaccio and the <title>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</title> of Louis XI. of France—brief, witty, and indecent. The choice of subjects in these early novelettes is seen in the existing collection of Parthenius of Nicaea, who taught Vergil Greek. From him have come down thirty-six skeleton stories, or rather hints for stories gathered by Parthenius for the use of Cornelius Gallus, and intended to be treated by him poetically. They can be found in both Greek and Latin versions in the Didot Collection <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1856)</bibl>. Other stories of this sort, written in other cities than Miletus, were produced by a host of storywriters who gave to their collections the titles Ephesian, Babylonian, Cyprian, Egyptian, Sybaritic, Naxian, Lydian, Trojan, and Bithynian Tales, though these do not seem to have differed, except in name, from those of Miletus. Some of them are preserved in epitome by <ref type="cross" target="crossphotius">Photius</ref> (q.v.). One of the most important writers of them after Aristides was Conon , from whom Cervantes borrowed an episode in his <title>Don Quixote.</title> While the short story was reaching its full development, it was used philosophically by Plato in the story of Er, and by Prodicus in his epilogue on the Choice of Heracles.</p>
 <p>At about this time fiction underwent a further development as a result of the contact of the Greeks with the East at the time of the Persian Wars and of the spirit of adventure resulting from the conquests of Alexander. We now have instances of the historical romance in the <title>Atlantis</title> of Plato and the <title>Cyropaedia</title> of Xenophon, which find their echo in modern times in the Utopia of Sir Thomas More and the <title>New Atlantis</title> of Francis Bacon. The <title>Cyropaedia</title> contains the first romantic love-story in Greek fiction. These works, however, are partly political, and are of less literary consequence than the romance of adventure which was afterwards introduced, and which finds an illustration in the novel entitled <foreign lang="greek">Τὰ Ὑπὲρ Θούλην Ἄπιστα</foreign> (Marvels Beyond Thulé), by one Antonius Diogenes, the Munchausen of antiquity. It relates to the love-adventures of an Arcadian youth, Dinias, 
<pb n="1107" /><cb />
 with a Tyrian girl, Dercyllis, and abounds with most extraordinary incidents. It is, in reality, nothing more than a collection of short stories or episodes strung together by a very slender plot. More homogeneous and artistic are the later romances of Lucius of Patrae of uncertain date called <title>Metamorphoses</title>, drawn upon by Lucian and Apuleius; of Iamblichus of Syria, who wrote <foreign lang="greek">Βαβυλωνικά</foreign>, the adventures of a married pair, Sinonis and Rhodanes, with a double plot; of Xenophon of Ephesus, author of <foreign lang="greek">Ἐφησιακά</foreign>, the loves of Abrocomas and Anthia, the ultimate source of <title>Romeo and Juliet;</title> and especially of Heliodorus of Emesa, in the fourth century A.D., whose <foreign lang="greek">Αἰθιοπικά</foreign> is still in existence, and is regarded as the best of the novels of adventure produced by the Greeks. It is in ten books, and relates the adventures of two lovers, Theagenes and Chariclea. It has some quite interesting episodes, is regularly developed, and contains one curious passage on the influence of pre-natal conditions upon the unborn child. It was much read in its day, and again in the seventeenth century, when it was the favourite novel of the French poet, Racine. See <ref type="cross" target="crossheliodorus">Heliodorus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Other instances of the romantic novel are those of Achilles Tatius of Alexandria, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Τὰ κατὰ Λευκίππην καὶ Κλειτοφῶντα</foreign> (The Loves of Leucippé and Clitophon) in eight books; the <title>Chaereas and Callirrhoë</title> of Chariton of Aphrodisias; and the novelette called <title>Apollonius Tyrius</title>, of unknown authorship, preserved only in a Latin version, in which it was much read in the Middle Ages, and suggested a part of Gower's <title>Confessio Amantis</title> (iii. 284 foll.), and probably Shakespeare's <title>Pericles, Prince of Tyre.</title> Of very late origin are the trashy Greek novels by Theodorus Prodromus of Constantinople, and the imitation of this by Nicetas Eugenianus (both in doggerel verse), and last of all the eleven books on the adventures of Hysminé and Hysminias, perhaps the original source of the story of Don Juan.</p>
 <p>Early in the Christian era, fiction was written in the form of letters by Alciphron, a Greek sophist, of whose imaginary epistles 118 are still preserved and give valuable pictures of low life in Athens during the second century A.D. They are very lively and entertaining, and are the best character sketches that Greek fiction can show us. Other writers of the same class are Aristaenetus of Nicaea (?), the author of two books of erotic letters written in a cynical spirit; and Theophilus of Simocatta (A.D. 610), from whom we have 85 letters, rhetorical and epigrammatic, but of no literary merit.</p>
 <p>The prose pastoral was created by Longus (perhaps not the author's name), whose romance <foreign lang="greek">Ποιμενικὰ τὰ κατὰ Δάφνιν καὶ Χλόην</foreign>, usually called <title>Daphnis and Chloë</title>, is one of the most original and pleasing things in ancient literature. Its theme is the growth of the sexual instinct in two children, a boy and a girl, who have been brought up together in a state of perfect innocence. Its physico-psychological motive makes it unique in the history of early fiction, and the warmth and beauty of its descriptions of nature are also very striking. It has been many times translated into all the modern languages, and is the original of Bernardin de St. Pierre's <title>Paul et Virginie</title>, of Allan Ramsay's <title>Gentle Shepherd</title>, and of many other less important works. <cb /></p>
 <p>The Romans have left us only two specimens of true prose fiction—the <title>Satiricon</title> of Petronius Arbiter and the <title>Metamorphoses</title> of Apuleius; but these are in many ways superior to anything of their kind in Greek. The <title>Satiricon</title>, in fact, though incomplete, is one of the first great novels of our time, and is remarkable for its modern tone, its subtle touches of character, its wit, its vivid pictures of life in the Roman provincial towns, and for the grace and elegance of its style. It also gives us some of the best existing specimens of the <seg lang="la">sermo plebeius</seg>, the colloquial Latinity of uneducated men. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspetronius">Petronius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.) The <title>Metamorphoses</title> of Apuleius is based upon the <title>Metamorphoses</title> of Lucius of Patrae, and possibly upon the <foreign lang="greek">Λούκιος ἢ Ὄνος</foreign> of Lucian, the contemporary of Apuleius; but it is more likely that both Apuleius and Lucian drew independently from the earlier writer. The novel of Apuleius, which is in eleven books, tells the story of one Lucius, who, by a mistake, swallowed a magic potion which turned him into an ass, in which form he passed through a maze of curious and amusing adventures, until at last he regained his natural shape. The novel is highly diverting and is told with much cleverness, though often with a disregard for even an elemental sense of propriety. Among its episodes is the very famous one giving the story of Cupid and Psyché, one of the most exquisite things in literature and one that has inspired innumerable works of art. See <ref type="cross" target="crossapuleius">Apuleius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspsyche">Psyché</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages, when the knowledge of ancient literature and history became lost to Western Europe, confused recollections of them still existed in the minds of men, and, together with many Teutonic folk-tales, became blended into a curious collection of stories known as the <title>Gesta Romanorum</title>, which were told and retold in many forms by the mediaevals. They mingle together the characters of antiquity in a most remarkable way, having no chronological or historical accuracy, but reproducing the legends of the past in a sort of literary mirage. Vergil, Homer, Alexander the Great, the Roman emperors, and Hercules, Romulus, and Remus, appear and reappear side by side with knights and wizards and dragons; but the tales have a certain value in literary history as forming the connecting link between the fiction of Greece and Rome and the fiction of modern times, which took its early themes largely from those monkish legends.</p>
 <p>The ancient novel is far inferior to the modern, because (1) it was developed only after literature had entered upon its decline;</p>
 <p>(2) because of the difference in the social spirit of antiquity which made impossible the modern romantic treatment of the relations of men and women; and</p>
 <p>(3) because the true fiction of the Greeks was to be found, not in prose, but in the great epics which more perfectly represented the highest manifestation of the Hellenic imagination.</p>

<head orig="Nuces">Nuces</head>

 <p> Nuts. Several games of skill were played by the Greeks and Romans with nuts. So identified with childhood and its sports were nuts that <seg lang="la">nuces relinquere</seg> was the conventional phrase used for “putting away childish things.” The games in question were as follows:</p>
 <p>(1) Pitching nuts into a hole, from a given distance—a game possibly called in Latin <seg lang="la">orca</seg>, from the jar which was often used as the receptacle of the nuts thrown ( <bibl n="Pers.  3. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iii. 50</bibl>). The Greeks also pitched the nuts into a circle drawn on the ground (<foreign lang="greek">ὤμιλλα</foreign>), or into a hole (<foreign lang="greek">βόθρος</foreign>) dug in the ground ( <bibl n="Poll.  9. 102" default="NO">Poll.ix. 102</bibl> and 103). The nuts that fell outside the jar, circle, or hole were forfeited.
 </p>
 <p>(2) A second game was called <seg lang="la">castellum</seg>, which was somewhat as follows: three nuts were placed on the ground, with a fourth resting on them, <figure id="fig.01108">
<head orig="Roman Boys playing Castellum. (Relief in the Blundell Collection.)">Roman Boys playing Castellum. (Relief in the Blundell Collection.)</head>
</figure> making a sort of pyramid. Then the player aimed his nut so as to scatter the pyramid (<seg lang="la">dilaminare</seg>), and, having done this, he had one or two 
<pb n="1109" /><cb />
 more shots, the object of which was to cannon on the nuts, as boys do in playing marbles. The first shot was taken standing (<seg lang="la">rectus</seg>), the next kneeling (<seg lang="la">pronus</seg>), the next being flipped, as in the “knuckle-down tight” of modern boys. Sometimes, however, the nuts were rolled down a board (<seg lang="la">tabula</seg>), as in the accompanying illustration, where the kneeling boy is probably arranging the <seg lang="la">castellum</seg>, or pyramid.
 </p>
 <p>(3) A third game with nuts was called <seg lang="la">delta.</seg> In this a triangle (<seg lang="la">delta</seg>) was chalked on the ground, and marked across with lines and bars (<seg lang="la">virgae</seg>) drawn parallel to the base. The player then flipped nuts into the triangle, and won as many nuts as he crossed bars, provided that he did not roll them out of the triangle, in which case they were forfeited. The best play was, therefore, that which drove the nut exactly to the apex of the delta.
 </p>

 <p> The second king of Rome, whose name belongs to legend rather than to history. He was a native of Cures, in the Sabine country, and was elected king one year after the death of Romulus, when the people became tired of the interregnum of the Senate. He was renowned for his wisdom and his piety; and it was generally believed that he had derived his knowledge from Pythagoras. His reign was long and peaceful, and he devoted his chief care to the establishment of religion among his rude subjects. He was instructed by the Camena Egeria, who visited him in a grove near Rome, and who honoured him with her love. He was revered by the Romans as the author of their whole religious worship. It was he who first appointed the pontiffs, the augurs, the flamens, the virgins of Vesta, and the Salii. He founded the Temple of Ianus, which remained always shut during his reign. The length of his reign is stated differently. Livy makes it forty-three years; Polybius and Cicero, thirty-nine years. The sacred books of Numa, in which he prescribed all the religious rites and ceremonies, were said to have been buried near him in a separate tomb, and to have been discovered by accident, 500 years afterwards, in B.C. 181. They were carried to the city-praetor Petilius, and were found to consist of twelve or seven books in Latin on ecclesiastical law and the same number of books in Greek on philosophy; the latter were burned by the command of the Senate, but the former were carefully preserved. The story of the discovery of these books is evidently a forgery; and the books, which were ascribed to Numa, and which were extant at a later time, were evidently nothing more than works containing an account of the ceremonial of the Roman religion.

<head orig="Numĕri">Numeri</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄριθμοι</foreign>). Numbers; numerals. The use of signs to denote numbers is older than writing; 
<pb n="1110" /><cb /> yet most of the existing numerical signs in Greek and Latin are alphabetic modifications; because very primitive peoples, being able to count no higher than ten or so, need few symbols of number, so that the characters for large numbers are of late origin. The earliest visible signs were probably the extended fingers. The early system was in fact one based upon five, the number of fingers on one hand, traces of which survive in the Greek words <foreign lang="greek">πεμπάζειν, πεμπαστής</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">πέντε</foreign>, “five” (cf. <title>Odyss.</title> iv. 412-415); and our denary system is due to the fact that the total number of our fingers is ten (cf. our English “-teen” as a termination). Finger-counting was very highly developed by the ancients, and many fairly complicated arithmetical operations could be denoted by finger-signs, as is still done in the Oriental bazaars, where the venders can reckon on their ten digits sums involving five places of figures. This system is fully described by Nicolaüs Smyrnaeus, a Greek of the thirteenth century A.D., in a treatise entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἔκφασις τοῦ Δακτυλικοῦ Μέτρου</foreign>, which was printed at Paris in 1636. Units and tens were represented by the fingers of the left hand, and hundreds or thousands by the fingers of the right. The thumb and forefinger of the left hand were devoted to tens, those of the right to hundreds; the remaining fingers of the left hand belonged to the units, those of the right to thousands. The fingers might be straight (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκτεινόμενοι</foreign>), bent (<foreign lang="greek">συστελλόμενοι</foreign>), or closed (<foreign lang="greek">κλινόμενοι</foreign>). In the left hand, bending the fourth finger marked 1; bending the third and fourth, 2; the middle, third, and fourth, 3; the middle and third only, 4; the middle only, 5; the third only, 6. Closing the fourth finger gave 7; the fourth and third fingers, 8; the middle, third, and fourth, 9. The same motions on the right hand indicated thousands, from 1000 to 9000. The motions of the forefinger and thumb, in representing tens and hundreds, on the left and right hands respectively, are more difficult to describe. Various combinations were also indicated by placing the hands upon the breast, the hips, etc. This system was taught in the Greek and Roman schools. (See Plut. <title>Apophth.</title> 1746; Dio Cass. lxxi. 32; <title>Anth. Pal.</title> xi. 72; and the works cited below.) Reckoning was also performed by pebbles or counters arranged in sets of ten—a system which was developed into the calculating-instrument known as the <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi>, and still used by the Chinese, who call it <hi rend="italic">swan-pan.</hi> See <ref type="cross" target="crossabacus">Abacus</ref>.</p>
 <p>For recording numbers, a system of single strokes was first used as the most obvious; but this, of course, would be too cumbrous when applied to large numbers. Hence, additional symbols came into use for 5, 10, 100, and 1000; and after alphabetical writing was invented these signs were employed as numerals, either following the order of the letters, or taking the initial letter of the word for its symbol. Thus, in Greek, the inscriptions give I for “one,” <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">πέντε</foreign>) for “five,” <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">δέκα</foreign>) for “ten,” H (old sign for rough breathing, <foreign lang="greek">ἕκατον</foreign>) for “one hundred,” <foreign lang="greek">Χ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">χίλιοι</foreign>) for “one thousand,” and <foreign lang="greek">Μ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">μύριοι</foreign>) for “ten thousand.” (See the articles on each letter of the alphabet in this Dictionary.) Then, a <foreign lang="greek">Π</foreign> with a <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> inscribed in it stood for 5X10=50, or with H inscribed in it for 500, etc. The twenty-five letters of the Ionic alphabet were used also for the simple numbers, 1 to 24. In the third century B.C. a new system <cb /> called the Herodian or Alexandrian was introduced, by which the cursive alphabet was divided into three groups, of which the first did duty for the units, the second for the tens, and the third for the hundreds. This required 27 instead of 24 letters; so the old characters <seg lang="la">digamma</seg> (q. v.), <hi rend="italic">koppa</hi> (q. v.), and the old sibilant <hi rend="italic">sampi</hi> (<figure />) were revived, the first representing 6, the second 90, and the third 900. Intermediate numbers like 11 were represented by the sum of 10 and 1, etc., as <foreign lang="greek">ιά</foreign>. This gave a notation for all numbers up to 999, and by a system of suffixes and indices the system was extended to represent numbers as high as 100,000,000. Until a comparatively late period these signs were used only to record results got by the use of the abacus; but at last they were employed in actual operations like our own. Long lists of multiples were learned by heart, and various operations of multiplication and division were obtained by repeated addition (<foreign lang="greek">σύνθεσις</foreign>) and subtraction (<foreign lang="greek">ἀφαίρεσις</foreign>). As late as the year 944 we find a scholar multiplying 400 by 5 by means of addition. A few skilled mathematicians like Hero of Alexandria and Theon multiplied as we do. Thus, to multiply 18 by 13 the operation was as follows: <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"><foreign lang="greek">ιγ</foreign>X<foreign lang="greek">ιη</foreign>=(<foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign>) (<foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">η</foreign>) </cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">13X18=(10+3) (10+8)</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=<foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">η</foreign>)+<foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">η</foreign>) </cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=10(10+8)+3(10+8)</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=<foreign lang="greek">ρ</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">π</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">λ</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">κδ</foreign></cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=100+80+30+24</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=<foreign lang="greek">σλδ</foreign></cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">=234</cell> </row> </table></p>
 <p>In the Alexandrian system thousands could be made by subscribing an <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> beneath the units; thus, <foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>=1000; <foreign lang="greek">αωθα</foreign>=1891. A sort of algebraic method was also used for very large numbers—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">βΜ</foreign>=(2X10,000)=20,000.</p>
 <p>The Roman system is, in its ordinary use, familiar to all readers. It is thought that <figure /> denotes the opening between the thumb and the forefinger; <figure /> is two <figure /> with the angles together; <figure /> is possibly for <seg lang="la">centum</seg>, but probably an original <figure /> assimilated to <figure /> may be for <seg lang="la">mille</seg>, but probably for <figure /> modified; <figure /> is from an old Chalcidian form of <figure />, inscribed for lapidary purposes as <figure />, and then simplified. Others believe <figure /> to be from a circle with a vertical stroke, and the <figure /> from a circle with a cross <figure />, from which last <figure />, and <figure /> would also be derived. The Romans, like the Greeks, used the system of finger-signs, and did arithmetical operations by aid of the <hi rend="italic">abacus.</hi> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossabacus">Abacus</ref>.) Their arrangement of the latter was more complete than the Greek, and allowed very elaborate calculations; and, in fact, the Romans were, in general, better arithmeticians than the Greeks. There is a book by one Victorius of the fifth century B.C. entitled <title>Calculus</title>, which is a sort of “ready-reckoner” of sums, differences, products, quotients, reductions, etc.</p>
 <p>Fractions (<foreign lang="greek">λεπτά</foreign>) are variously represented in MS., but the most common way is to write the denominator over the numerator (the reverse of our method), or to write the numerator once with one accent and the denominator twice with two accents. Thus, <foreign lang="greek">α<hi rend="superscript">α</hi></foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ιζ' κα κα</foreign>. The Romans treated fractions as did the Greeks, and attempted quite difficult operations, which were often very inexactly performed (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 6. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vi. 38</bibl>).</p>

 <p>As to the history of mathematics among the Greeks and Romans, it may be said that the earliest Greek school of mathematics was that founded by Thales of Miletus (B.C. 640-550), who studied astronomy and geometry in Egypt, and, after returning to Miletus, taught them to his disciples. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossthales">Thales</ref>.) His geometrical teaching was largely deductive, and the following theorems of Euclid are ascribed to him: i. 5; i. 15; i. 26; vi. 4 (vi. 2?); iii. 31. He also wrote a treatise on astronomy. His philosophical follower, Anaximander, wrote a treatise on spherical geometry and constructional globes. This school, known as the Ionian School, flourished till about B.C. 400. It really gave more attention to astronomy than to geometry, which as an actual part of a liberal education, dates from Pythagoras (B.C. 569-500), whose philosophy and even whose ethics rested on a mathematical basis. He first arranged the leading problems of geometry in logical order, and carried arithmetic beyond the mere needs of the trader. (See Hoffmann, <title>Der pythagorische Lehrsatz</title> [Mainz, 1821].) Archytas, a follower of Pythagoras (about B.C. 400) and head of the school, applied mathematics to mechanics, and also worked in astronomy, teaching that the earth is a sphere revolving on its axis once in twenty-four hours. He attacked one of the most famous problems in antiquity—to find the side of a cube whose volume should be double that of a given cube. Two other well-known mathematical schools were the Eleatic, whose great name was Zeno's (B.C. 495-435), and the Atomistic School of Democritus of Abdera (B.C. 460-370). In the fourth century Athens became a great centre for mathematical study, and the scholars Anaxagoras (B.C. 500-428), Hippocrates of Chios, Eudoxus, Plato, and Theaetetus are among its greatest names. Hippocrates wrote the first text-book on geometry, and attempted the quadrature of the circle. Eudoxus founded the School of Cyzicus, to which Menaechmus and Aristaeus also gave distinction. Aristotle (B.C. 384-322) did much to stimulate the study of mathematics, and especially of mechanics. The establishment of a great university in Alexandria (see <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>) made that city an intellectual centre; and there three of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity flourished—Euclid (B.C. 330?-275), Archimedes (B.C. 287-212), and Apollonius (B.C. 260-200). (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapollonius">Apollonius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossarchimedes">Archimedes</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosseuclides">Euclides</ref>.) After these came Hipparchus, the most eminent of Greek astronomers (B.C. 160), whose work is preserved in Ptolemy's great treatise known as the <title>Almagest.</title> He determined the true length of the year, and placed the study of astronomy on a truly scientific basis. Hero of Alexandria (about B.C. 125) did the same for land-surveying and engineering. The Roman occupation of Egypt seriously interrupted the studies of the Alexandrian School; and no mathematicians of equal eminence with those already mentioned are afterwards found. The most original works subsequently published are the treatise by Serenus (A.D. 70) on the plane sections of the cone and cylinder, and that by Menelaüs on spherical trigonometry. About A.D. 100 the Jewish scholar Nicomachus wrote an arithmetic which, in a Latin version, remained the standard <cb /> treatise on the subject for a thousand years. Ptolemy of Alexandria, who died in the year A.D. 168, was the author of a great work on astronomy; Pappus, in the third century, published a useful synopsis of Greek mathematics. In the fourth century geometrical studies decline, and algebra begins to be pursued, though possibly not unknown. It was probably at first what is called “rhetorical algebra”—i. e. the problems were solved by a process of reasoning expressed in words rather than in symbols. Diophantus of Alexandria (probably a non-Greek) introduced a system of signs and abbreviations. He lived in the fourth century A.D. (See Heath, <title>Diophantos of Alexandria</title> [Cambridge, 1885].) His work is called <title>Arithmetica</title>, but is really an algebra. The last of the Alexandrian mathematicians are the famous <ref type="cross" target="crosshypatia">Hypatia</ref> (q.v.) and Theon , her father. In the fifth century there were some Athenian geometricians of repute, such as Proclus, Damascius, and Eutocius; and in the sixth century the Roman Boëtius forms the link between the mathematical studies of antiquity and those of the Middle Ages. He wrote a geometry which contained the problems of the first book of Euclid and a few other selected propositions, and an arithmetic founded on that of Nicomachus. Cassiodorus (A.D. 470-566), and Isidorus of Seville (A.D. 570-636), also wrote in an elementary way of the various mathematical sciences.</p>

<head orig="Numeriānus">Numerianus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus-aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</ref>. A Roman who succeeded to the imperial throne conjointly with his elder brother Carinus, after the death of their father Carus, at the beginning of A.D. 284. Numerianus was with the army in Mesopotamia at the death of Probus; but, instead of following up the advantage which his father had gained over the Persians, he was compelled by the army to abandon the conquests which had been already made, and to retreat to Syria. During the retreat, a weakness of the eyes obliged him to confine himself to a litter, which was guarded by the praetorians. The administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, devolved on Arrius Aper, the praetorian prefect, his father-in-law. The army was eight months on its march from the banks of the Tigris to the Thracian Bosporus, and during all that time the imperial authority was exercised in the name of the emperor, who never appeared to his soldiers. Reports at length spread among them that their emperor was no longer living; and when they had reached the city of Chalcedon they could not be prevented from breaking into the imperial tent, where they found only his corpse. Suspicion naturally fell upon Arrius; and an assembly of the army was accordingly held, for the purpose of avenging the death of Numerianus and electing a new emperor. Their choice fell upon Diocletian, who, immediately after his election, put Arrius to death with his own hands, without giving him an opportunity of justifying himself, which might, perhaps, have proved dangerous to the new emperor. The virtues of Numerianus are mentioned by most of his biographers. His manners were mild and affable; and he was celebrated among his contemporaries for eloquence and poetic

<head orig="Numidia">Numidia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νουμιδία, Νομαδία</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">Νομαδική</foreign>). A country of Africa, bounded on the east by Africa Propria, on the north by the Mediterranean, on the south by Gaetulia, and on the west by Mauretania. The Roman province of Numidia was, however, of somewhat smaller extent. Intersected by a chain of the Lesser Atlas, and watered by the streams running down from it, it abounded in fine pastures, which were early taken possession of by wandering tribes of Asiatic origin, who from their occupation as herdsmen were called by the Greeks, here as elsewhere, <foreign lang="greek">Νομάδες</foreign>, and this name was perpetuated in that of the country. A sufficient account of these tribes, and of their connection with their neighbours in the west, is given under <ref type="cross" target="crossmauretania">Mauretania</ref>. The fertility of the country, inviting to agriculture, gradually gave a somewhat more settled character to the people; and, at their first appearance in Roman history, we find their two great tribes, the Massylians and the Massaesylians, forming two monarchies, which were united into one under Masinissa, B.C. 201. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmasinissa">Masinissa</ref>.) On Masinissa's death in 148, his kingdom was divided, by his dying directions, between his three sons, Micipsa, Mastanabal, and Gulussa; but it was soon reunited under Micipsa, in consequence of the death of both his brothers. His death, in 118, was speedily followed by the usurpation of Iugurtha, an account of which and of the ensuing war with the Romans is given under <ref type="cross" target="crossiugurtha">Iugurtha</ref>. On the defeat of Iugurtha in 106, the country became virtually subject to the Romans, but they permitted the family of Masinissa to govern it, with the royal title (see <ref type="cross" target="crosshiempsal">Hiempsal</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossiuba">Iuba</ref>), until B.C. 46, when Iuba, who had espoused the cause of Pompey in the Civil Wars, was defeated and dethroned by Iulius Caesar, and Numidia was made a Roman province. It seems to have been about the same time or a little later, under Augustus, that the western part of the country was taken from Numidia, and added to Mauretania, as far east as Saldac. In B.C. 30 Augustus restored Iuba II. to his father's kingdom of Numidia; but in B.C. 25 he exchanged it for Mauretania, and Numidia—that is, the country between Saldae on the west and the Tusca on the east—became a Roman province. It was again diminished by near a half under Claudius; and henceforth, until the Arab conquest, the senatorial province of Numidia denoted the district between the river Ampsaga on the west and the Tusca on the east; its capital was Cirta (Constantin). The country, in its later restricted limits, is often distinguished by the name of New Numidia or Numidia Proper. The Numidians are known to military history as furnishing the best light cavalry in the Carthaginian and Roman armies. <cb />

The science which has to do with the study of coins and, in its widest acceptance, of medals also. The value of the science is not only historical and chronological, but artistic and archaeological in the broadest sense of the word.

 <p>The ancient names for money are various. The Greeks use <foreign lang="greek">χρήματα</foreign> of wealth in general, not merely coined money; <foreign lang="greek">ἀργύριον</foreign> denotes money of any kind (originally silver money only); <foreign lang="greek">νομίσματα</foreign> (from <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>, “law”), legal-tender money ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 94</bibl>). The Romans employ <seg lang="la">nummus</seg> in various ways, but when not qualified it usually refers to the <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg>, which was the standard coin. In Late Latin <hi rend="italic">moneta</hi> is the generic term for money, whence the modern word; but in the earlier usage <seg lang="la">pecunia</seg> is the word employed.</p>
 <p>The principal materials for money were gold, silver, bronze; sometimes <seg lang="la">electrum</seg> (gold alloyed with silver), iron (at Sparta and some of the other Peloponnesian cities), nickel (used by the Greek kings in India), and rarely pure copper. We also read that Polycrates made coins of lead ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 56</bibl>), Dionysius of tin (Pollux, ix. 79), and the Laconians of leather ( <title>De Benef.</title> v. 14).

 <p>Greek coins are variously inscribed, having the name of the city or ruler issuing them; that of the monetary official or officials, and sometimes that of the artist who cut the die. The earliest of all bear no legend. Later, the names of cities appear, or of the people of the city in the genitive case—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">Συρακοσίων</foreign>; or else the genitive adjective is used—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρκαδικόν</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">νόμισμα</foreign>.) Names of kings are usually in the genitive. When magistrates' names are given they are sometimes in the nominative case and sometimes in the genitive preceded by <foreign lang="greek">ἐπί</foreign>. At Athens, during the later days of her independence, every coin bears the names of three distinct magistrates. Other Greek coins (e. g. the later coins of Rhodes and Ephesus, and the copper money of the Achaean League) exhibit the name of only one magistrate. Artists' signatures occasionally occur, oftenest upon Sicilian coins. See Von <bibl default="NO">Sallat, <title>Künstlerinschriften auf griech. Münzen</title> (1871)</bibl>; and Lenormant, <title>La Monnaie dans l'Antiquité</title>, iii. p. 255.</p>
 <p>The earliest gold and silver money of the Romans bears only the word <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">roma</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">romano</hi>, with the mark of value; and by the time of Sulla the name of the city and the indication of value both disappear as unnecessary. There are used the names of the <seg lang="la">triumvir monetalis</seg> (this as early as B.C. 190), and from B.C. 100 legends explanatory of the “types” of the coins—e. g. P. P. (<title>Penates Publici</title>); or, fully written, <hi rend="SmallCaps">salvs</hi> beside the head of their deity. Under the Empire, coins regularly show the effigy of the emperor with his name and title, and the other side a date or an inscription referring to some historical event, or to a “type” with a like allusion 
<pb n="1113" /><cb /></p>
 <p>—e. g. <hi rend="SmallCaps">fecvnditati avgvstae</hi>, when the empress had just borne a child; <hi rend="SmallCaps">fides militvm</hi>, when the soldiers had just presented a loyal address, etc. A word of explanation as to the terms “type” and “symbol” in their technical sense is necessary. “Type” is used of the principal device or subject on either obverse or reverse; “symbol” is applied to a minor figure. Thus the “type” belongs to the city or State; the “symbol” to the monetary magistrate.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek Coins</hi>.—In Homer's time, cattle served as a medium of exchange and a standard of value ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 211" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 211</bibl>; xxi. 385); but metals were also used in the same way, and their value was decided by weight. The balance in which they were weighed was called <foreign lang="greek">τάλαντον</foreign>, and the same name was given to the weight. The gold <foreign lang="greek">τάλαντον</foreign> or talent of Homer was probably equivalent to the value of an ox, and in weight=2 drachmae. At an early date the idea arose of giving the metal so used a special form, but just when money was first coined with an official stamp is not known. As early as the fifth century B.C. a highly elaborated and artistic system of coinage was in existence. Various Greek standards of value were developed —in several gradations, it is true—from the gold and silver standard of Asia Minor. It was not until a later time that the standard of the Persian gold money was in some cities transferred to the silver coinage. The proportion of gold to silver was commonly reckoned among the Greeks as 10:1, so that a gold piece weighing 2 drachmae <figure id="fig.01113">
<head orig="Aeginetan Drachma, actual size. (British Museum.)">Aeginetan Drachma, actual size. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> was=20 silver drachmae. But in commerce the proportion assumed was 12:1, and this was the average generally observed in the Roman Empire. The measure of weight most commonly current was the talent, which contained 60 minae. Like the talent, the mina was not a real coin, but a standard of measurement. The unit of coinage <figure id="fig.01113.2">
<head orig="Attic Drachma, actual size. (British Museum.)">Aeginetan Drachma, actual size. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> was the drachma, 100 drachmae being reckoned to the mina. The drachma, again, contained 6 obols. In ancient times the commonly accepted standard was that of Aegina. The coins of the island of Aegina were stamped on one side with the figure of a tortoise, on the other side with a roughly executed incuse square. The largest silver coin was the <foreign lang="greek">στατήρ</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">didrachmon</hi> (=about $0.52, the Aeginetan drachma being=$0.26). Solon abolished this standard in Attica, and introduced a lighter drachma equal to about $0.16. The Attic talent (=6000 drachmae) <cb /> was thus worth about $1000, the mina about $16. The silver coins of Attica bore on the front the head of Pallas, and on the reverse the figure of an owl. The principal coin was the <foreign lang="greek">τετράδραχμον</foreign> or 4 drachmae, the largest (which was <figure id="fig.01113.3">

The <foreign lang="greek">τριώβολον</foreign> (3 obols), the <foreign lang="greek">ὀβολός</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">ἡμιωβόλον</foreign> (1/2 obol) were small silver coins; the <foreign lang="greek">τεταρτημόριον</foreign> (1/4 obol) the smallest of all.</p>
 <p>The Greek States always adopted a silver currency, gold being rarely issued. The largest gold piece was the <hi rend="italic">didrachmon</hi> or golden <foreign lang="greek">στατήρ</foreign> (=20 silver drachmae). Besides this we find drachmas, triobols, obols, half-obols, quarter-obols, and even eighth-obols in gold. The gold money most com<figure id="fig.01113.5">

</figure> monly current in Greece was, down to the Macedonian age, the royal Persian coin called <foreign lang="greek">δαρεικός</foreign>, or daric. It was stamped on one side with a crowned archer, on the other with an oblong incuse. This corresponded with the gold stater of Attica and of the cities of Asia Minor. Among these should be especially mentioned the stater of Cyzicus or the <title>Cyzicenus</title>=28 silver drachmae. The earliest copper coin issued at Athens was the <foreign lang="greek">χαλκοῦς</foreign>=1/8 of a silver obol (B.C. 440). In the time of Alexander the Great the silver coinage stopped at the triobolus, and it therefore became necessary to represent the smaller fractions in copper. The silver money of Attica was in very general use, but the Attic standard was not adopted in Greece Proper. It spread westward, however, in quite early times. In the greater part of Sicily, and in Tarentum and Etruria, the coinage was from the <figure id="fig.01113.6">
<head orig="Silver Daric, actual size. (British Museum.)">Gold Daric, actual size. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> first regulated in accordance with the Attic standard. But the wide diffusion of this standard was mainly due to the action of Philip II. of Macedon and Alexander the Great. The former adopted it when introducing his gold coinage (<foreign lang="greek">Φίλιππος</foreign>), the 
<pb n="1114" /><cb />
 latter for his silver money (see illustration); and even after Alexander's death this standard held its ground in the kingdoms of the Macedonian Empire, except in Egypt, where the Ptolemies maintained the old coinage of the country. Macedonian influence extended the Attic currency into many other States—e. g. Epirus, the coasts of the <figure id="fig.01114">

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman Coins</hi>.—As in Greece, so at Rome, oxen and sheep were originally the medium of exchange. The oldest pecuniary fines were exacted in cattle, <cb /> and the Latin word for money (<seg lang="la">pecunia</seg>), is derived from <seg lang="la">pecus.</seg> In later times unwrought copper (<seg lang="la">aes rude</seg>), given in pieces according to weight, took the place of oxen. Bars of cast copper marked on both sides with some figure (as of an ox, pig, or fowl) are said to have been introduced by King Servius Tullius when he took in hand the regulation of weights and measures. The first demonstrable example of a coin is from the age of the decemvirs (about B.C. 450). The unit of coinage was the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> of cast copper, carrying the nominal weight of the Roman pound (<seg lang="la">libra</seg>=12 <seg lang="la">unciae</seg>). <figure id="fig.01114.5"><head>Roman <title>As</title> of Cast Copper.</head></figure> The <hi rend="italic">as (aes grave)</hi> bore the image of Ianus; the coins representing its fractions were all stamped on the reverse side with the figure of a ship's prow. These were <seg lang="la">semis</seg>, with the head of Iupiter=1/2 <hi rend="italic">as</hi> or 6 <seg lang="la">unciae; triens</seg>, with the head of Minerva, 1/3 of an <hi rend="italic">as</hi>=4 <seg lang="la">unciae; quadrans</seg>, with the head of Heracles, 1/4 <hi rend="italic">as</hi>=3 <seg lang="la">unciae; sextans</seg>, with the head of Mercury, 1/6 <hi rend="italic">as</hi>=2 <seg lang="la">unciae; uncia</seg>, with the head of Roma, 1/12 <hi rend="italic">as.</hi> As in the course of time the copper money became lighter, the smaller fractional coins were first struck, and afterwards all the fractions. This copper currency was intended exclusively for the home trade, so that it was easily allowed to suffer a continuous depreciation, at first to 4, then to 2, after B.C. 217 to 1 ounce, after B.C. 89 to 1/2 an ounce, and under the Empire even to 1/4 an ounce. In B.C. 269 a silver currency was intro<figure id="fig.01114.6">
<head orig="Denarii, actual size. (British Museum.)">Denarii, actual size. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> duced, and a mint for it set up on the Capitoline Hill in the temple of Iuno Moneta. The silver fractional coins struck according to the Athenian and Sicilian standard were the <seg lang="la">denarius</seg> (about $0.19)=10 <seg lang="la">asses</seg> of 4 ounces; the <seg lang="la">quinarius</seg>=5 <seg lang="la">asses;</seg> and the <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg>=2 1/2 <seg lang="la">asses.</seg> These coins were denoted by the characters X, V, and HS (II.S [<seg lang="la">semis</seg>] respectively. There is displayed on the obverse the head of Roma personified, wearing a winged helmet, and on the reverse the Dioscuri on horseback. Later we find Diana Victoria in a

The <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg> was the equivalent of the old <hi rend="italic">as.</hi> Payments were made in <seg lang="la">denarii</seg>, but calculated in <seg lang="la">sestertii</seg>, whence, as stated above, the word <seg lang="la">nummus</seg> (coin) is generally synonymous with <seg lang="la">sestertius.</seg></p>
 <p>The reduction of the copper <hi rend="italic">as</hi> to 1 <seg lang="la">uncia</seg> in B.C. 217 degraded the copper money to the position of small coin, and silver currency drove out the copper. The <seg lang="la">denarius</seg> sank at the same time to the value of about $0.15, which it maintained till the time of Nero. The <seg lang="la">denarius</seg> was reckoned as=16 <seg lang="la">asses</seg>, the <seg lang="la">quinarius</seg> as 8, and the <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg> (nearly $0.03)=4. At about the same period a temporary effort was made to introduce gold coinage. This movement was not taken up again till towards the end of the Republic, when Caesar struck a large number of gold coins (<seg lang="la">aurei</seg>) equal in weight to 1/40 of the Roman pound, and in value 25 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> or 100 <seg lang="la">sestertii</seg> (a little over $5). No regular coinage was carried on in the time of the Republic, but the necessary money was minted as occasion required. This was done in Rome at the commission of the Senate under the superintendence of certain officials intrusted with the duty. A permanent board of three persons (<seg lang="la">tres viri monetales</seg>) was at last appointed for the purpose. In the provinces money was coined by the Roman generals and governors. From the time of Augustus the emperor retained the exclusive privilege of coining gold and silver money, the copper coinage being left to the Senate. The standard of the imperial coinage was the <seg lang="la">aureus</seg> of Caesar, the weight of which sank with many variations lower and lower, until Constantine (A.D. 312) fixed it at 1/12 of a pound (about $3). The <seg lang="la">aureus</seg> now got the name of <seg lang="la">solidus</seg>, and was stamped, first with the Roman numer<figure id="fig.01115.2">
<head orig="Aureus of Marcus Aurelius.">Aureus of Marcus Aurelius.</head>
</figure> al LXXII, and later with the Greek numeral OB= 72. It remained in use down to the fall of the Eastern Empire, the name surviving in modern times in the Italian <seg lang="la">soldo.</seg> Of the silver pieces of the Republic, the <seg lang="la">denarius</seg> and the <seg lang="la">quinarius</seg> alone remained in use under the Empire, all the rest being stamped in copper. The <seg lang="la">denarius</seg> remained of the value of $0.17, as fixed in B.C. 217, until Nero's time, when it was reduced in weight and fineness until it was worth only about $0.12. During the second century it fell to $0.06, and the silver coinage in consequence was changed to small money. Diocletian, about A.D. 292, reformed the currency, issuing a new silver coin, the <seg lang="la">argenteus</seg>, equal in weight to Nero's <seg lang="la">denarius.</seg> This was in use until A.D. 360, when a new system of silver <cb /> coinage on the basis of the gold <seg lang="la">solidus</seg> was instituted.</p>
 <p>The copper coins, as issued by the authority of the Senate, bore the letters S. C. (<seg lang="la">senatus consulto</seg>). The following small coins were issued under the Empire: <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg>=4 <seg lang="la">asses; dupondius</seg>=2 <seg lang="la">asses; semis</seg>=1/2 <hi rend="italic">as;</hi> and the <seg lang="la">quadrans</seg>=1/4 <hi rend="italic">as.</hi> The <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg> and the <seg lang="la">dupondius</seg> were of brass; the <seg lang="la">semis</seg> and <seg lang="la">quadrans</seg> of copper. The <seg lang="la">quadrans</seg> was disused under Trajan; the <seg lang="la">dupondius, as, semis</seg>, and <seg lang="la">sestertius</seg> under Diocletian. <figure id="fig.01115.3">

 <p> (Old Lat. <hi rend="italic">noundinae</hi>). The Roman term for the market day held on the last day of the week of eight days, on which countrymen rested from labour and came to Rome to buy and sell, as well as to do other business. Accordingly the Nundinae were used for public announcements especially concerning public assemblies and the business to be conducted in them. The actual holding of the assemblies on these days was avoided, so as not to prevent the people from attending to the business of the market. Originally, too, no legal business was conducted on them, and it was not till the beginning of the third century B.C. that it was introduced. The Nundinae, though not a regular feast-day, were nevertheless celebrated in private life by inviting strangers to one's table and exempting children from going to school. The form <seg lang="la">nundinum</seg> (sc. <seg lang="la">tempus</seg>) or <seg lang="la">inter nundinum</seg> means the whole period of eight days.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νύμφαι</foreign>, properly “the young maidens”). Inferior divinities of nature dwelling in groves, forests, and caves, beside springs, streams, and rivers; in some cases, too, on lonely islands, like Calypso and Circé. The nymphs of the hills, the forests, the meadows, and the springs (called in Homer daughters of Zeus, while Hesiod makes the nymphs of the hills and the forests, together with the hills and the forests, children of earth) appear as the benevolent spirits of these spots, and lead a life of liberty, sometimes weaving in grottoes, sometimes dancing and singing, sometimes hunting with Artemis, or revelling with Dionysus. Besides these divinities it is especially Apollo, Hermes, and Pan who are devoted to them and seek after their love; while the wanton satyrs are also continually lying in wait for them. They are well disposed towards mortals, and ready to help them; they even wed with them. According to the various provinces of nature were distinguished various kinds of nymphs: nymphs of rivers (<foreign lang="greek">Ποταμηΐδες</foreign>) and springs, the Naiads (<foreign lang="greek">Νηΐδες</foreign>), to whom the Oceanids (<foreign lang="greek">Ὠκεανίδες</foreign>) and Nereïds (<foreign lang="greek">Νηρηΐδες</foreign>) are closely related; nymphs of the hills, Oreads (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀρειάδες</foreign>); nymphs of the forests and trees, Dryads (<foreign lang="greek">Δρυάδες</foreign>) or Hamadryads (<foreign lang="greek">Ἁμαδρυάδες</foreign>); besides this they often received special names after certain places, hills, springs, and grottoes. The Naiads, as the goddesses of the nourishing and fructifying water, were especially rich in favours, giving increase and fruitfulness to plants, herds, and mortals. Hence, they were also considered as the guardian goddesses of marriage, and the besprinkling of the bride with spring-water was one of the indispensable rites of the marriage ceremony. On the same principle, legendary lore represents them as nursing and bringing up the children of the gods, as, for instance, Zeus and Dionysus. Further, owing to the healing and inspiring power <cb /> of many springs, they belong to the divinities of healing and prophesying, and can even drive men into a transport of prophetic and poetic inspiration. The Muses themselves are, in their origin, fountain-nymphs. Popular belief assigned to the nymphs in general an exceedingly long life, without actual immortality. The existence of Dryads, it was supposed, was closely bound up with the origin and decay of the tree in which they dwelt. They enjoyed divine honours from the earliest times, originally in the spots where they had power, at fountains, and in groves and grottoes. In later times shrines of their own, hence called Nymphaea, were built to them, even in cities. These eventually became very magnificent buildings, in which it was customary to celebrate marriages. Goats, lambs, milk, and oil were offered to them. Works of art represented them in the form of charming maidens, lightly clothed or naked, with flowers and garlands; the Naiads drawing water, or carrying it in an urn. They appear as the attendants of Hermes, the deity of herdsmen; of Pan, of Artemis, and of Apollo—this last in the prophetic character.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Νύξ</foreign>), by the Romans called <hi rend="bold">Nox.</hi> One of the most ancient deities, daughter of Chaos. From her union with her brother Erebus, she gave birth to the Day and the Light. She was also the mother of the Moerae, Hesperides, Hypnos, Nemesis, Discord, Thanatos, Momus, Fraus, etc. She is called by some of the poets the mother of all things, of gods as well as of men, and was worshipped <cb /> with great solemnity. A black sheep and a cock, the latter as announcing the approach of day, were sacrificed to her.</p>
 <p>Night was represented under various forms: as riding in a chariot preceded by the constellations, with wings, to denote the rapidity of her course; as traversing the firmament seated in her car, and covered with a black veil studded with stars. Sometimes her veil seems to be floating on the wind, while she approaches the earth to extinguish a flaming torch which she carries in her hand. She has often been confounded with Artemis, or the moon; and her statue was placed in the temple of that goddess at Ephesus ( <title>Praef.;</title> <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
<note id="ref3" target="n3">The power of the quaestors to fine is disputed by Mommsen. But even curatores could fine. (See Karlowa, Rechtsgeschichte, p. 171.)</note>
