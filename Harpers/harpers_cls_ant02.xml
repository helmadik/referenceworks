 <head>Tower of <term>Babel</term></head>
 <p>The tower mentioned in Genesis xi. as having been commenced by the descendants of Noah on the plain of Shinar (Sumir), in order to reach the heavens and thus escape from the danger of a second Deluge. Jehovah, however, confounded the language of the builders, so that they no longer understood one another, and thus became scattered. From this the tower, which remained unfinished, was called <title>Babel</title> or “confusion” ( <hi rend="italic">Heb. balbel</hi>, to confound). This etymology is, however, only a specimen of Old Testament paronomasia, in that <title>Babel</title> is in reality the Assyrian <hi rend="italic">bab-ili</hi>, “the gate of God”—a Semitic rendering of the Sumirian name <title>Ca-dimíra.</title> Some fragments of a cuneiform text were discovered by Mr. George Smith containing a narrative closely parallel to the Biblical account. The story in Greek mythology of the attempt of the Giants to scale heaven is probably an echo of Babylonian tradition. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgigantes">Gigantes</ref>.</p>
 <p>Nothing is known regarding the site of the Tower of Babel, beyond the fact that it was in or very near Babylon. It is generally held to be represented by the great pile Birs Nimroud, which stands in Borsippa, a suburb of Babylon, eight 
<pb n="176" /><cb />
 miles distant, and dedicated to the god Nebo. Sir Henry Rawlinson made the discovery that the pile consisted of seven stages of brickwork on an earthen platform, each stage being of a different colour. The temple was known as the Temple of the Seven Lights (planets), each stage being consecrated to a light or planet. <figure id="fig.00176">

 <p>Another proposed site is that of the ruins now called Bab-il, within the city of Babylon. Here the mound is 1100 yards in length and 800 in breadth.

<head orig="Babrius">Babrius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βάβριος</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Babrias</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Βαβρίας</foreign>). The compiler of a comprehensive collection of Aesop's fables in choliambic metre. The book is probably to be assigned to the beginning of the first century B.C. Until 1842 nothing was known of Babrius but fragments and paraphrases, bearing the name of Aesopus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaesopus">Aesopus</ref>.) But in that year a Greek, Minoides Minas, discovered 123 of the original fables in the monastery on Mt. Athos. <cb /> In 1857, he brought out 95 more, the genuineness of which was disputed by Cobet and other scholars. These were edited by Lewis in 1859, and are included in Bergk's <title>Anthologia Lyrica</title>, 4th ed. <bibl default="NO">(1883)</bibl>. Babrius has been edited also by Lachmann <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1845)</bibl>, and, with additions from the Bodleian and Vatican MSS., by Gitlbauer <bibl default="NO">(Vienna, 1882)</bibl>. The style of Babrius is simple and pleasing, the tone fresh and lively. The fables of <ref type="cross" target="crossphaedrus">Phaedrus</ref> (q.v.) were imitated, with considerable closeness to the original, from the <foreign lang="greek">μῦθοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μυθίαμβοι</foreign> of Babrius.

<head orig="Babylon">Babylon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βαβυλών</foreign>). (1) The name of a fortress in Lower Egypt on the right bank of the Nile, opposite the pyramids of Ghizeh. It was said to have been founded by exiles from Babylonia, and under the Romans became a place of considerable importance.</p>
 <p>(2) A celebrated city, the capital of the Babylonian (Chaldaean) Empire, situated on the Euphrates. The ancient accounts of its origin and of the structure of the city are extremely confused. The god <ref type="cross" target="crossbelus">Belus</ref> (q.v.) is spoken of as its founder, and also Semiramis and Nitocris. According to Diodorus (ii. 7), Semiramis employed upon it two million workmen collected from all parts of her realm. It must be understood, however, that nearly all the ancient accounts of Babylon refer not to the primitive city, but to the later capital and residence of Nebuchadnezzar. Herodotus describes it in the first book of his history, as if from his personal observation.</p>
 <p>The shape of the city of Babylon was that of a square, traversed each way by twenty-five principal streets, which, of course, intersected each other, dividing the city into 625 squares. These streets were terminated at each end by gates of brass of prodigious size and strength, with a smaller one opening towards the river. Respecting the height and thickness of the walls of Babylon, there are great variations among the ancient writers. Herodotus makes them 200 royal cubits (or 337 feet 8 inches) high and 50 royal cubits (or 84 feet 6 inches) broad, which seems incredible. A difficulty also presents itself with regard to the extent of the walls of Babylon. Herodotus makes them 120 stadia each side, or 480 in circumference. Pliny and Solinus give them the circuit at 60 Roman miles, which, reckoning eight stadia to a mile, agrees with the account of Herodotus. Strabo makes it 385 stadia. Diodorus, from Ctesias, assigns 360, but from Clitarchus, who accompanied Alexander, 365. Curtius gives 368. Taking the circumference of Babylon at 365 stadia, and these at 491 feet, each side of the square (which is equal to 91 1/4 stadia) will be 8.485 British miles, or nearly 8 1/2. This gives an area of 72 miles and an inconsiderable fraction. It is to be remembered, however, that the walls, like those of most Oriental towns, enclosed rather populous districts than mere cities. That the 
<pb n="177" /><cb />
 area enclosed by the walls of Babylon was only partly built on is proved by the words of Quintus Curtius (v. 4), who says that “the buildings in Babylon are not contiguous to the walls, but some considerable space was left all around.” Diodorus, moreover, describes a vast space taken up by the palaces and public buildings. The enclosure of one of the palaces was a square of 15 stadia, or near 1 1/2 mile; the other of 5 stadia—here are more than 2 1/2 square miles occupied by the palaces alone. Besides these, there were the Temple and Tower of Belus, of vast extent; and the Hanging Gardens. From all this, and much more that might be adduced, we may collect most clearly that much vacant space remained within the walls of Babylon; and this would seem to do away, in some degree, with the great difficulty respecting the magnitude of the city itself. Nor is it stated as the effect of the subsequent decline of Babylon, but as the actual state of it when Alexander first entered the place, for Curtius leaves us to understand that the system of cultivating a large proportion of the enclosed space originat<figure id="fig.00177">
<head orig="Plan of Babylon. (According to Rich.)">Plan of Babylon. (According to Rich.)</head>
</figure> ed with the foundation itself; and the history of its two sieges, by Cyrus and Darius Hystaspis, seems to show it (Rennell's <title>Geography of Herodotus</title>, i. 447). The walls of Babylon were built of brick baked in the sun, cemented with bitumen instead of mortar, and were encompassed by a broad and deep ditch, lined with the same materials, as were also the banks of the river in its course through the city, the inhabitants descending to the water by steps through the smaller brass gates already mentioned. Over the river was a bridge, connecting the two halves of the city, which stood, the one on its eastern, the other on its western bank; the river running nearly north and south. The bridge was five furlongs in length and thirty feet in breadth, and had a palace at each end, with, it is said, a subterranean passage beneath the river from one to the other, the work of Semiramis. Of this bridge no traces have yet been found.</p>
 <p>Within or near the city was the Temple of Belus, or Baal, which Herodotus describes as a square of <cb /> two stadia; in the midst of this arose the celebrated tower, to which both the same writer and Strabo give an elevation of one stadium, and the same measure at its base. The whole was divided into eight separate towers, one above another, of decreasing dimensions to the summit, where stood a chapel, containing a couch, table, and other things of gold. Here the principal devotions were performed; and over this, on the highest platform of all, was the observatory, by the help of which the Babylonians are said to have attained to great skill in astronomy. A winding staircase on the outside formed the ascent to this stupendous edifice. The Old Palace, which stood on the east side of the bridge over the river, was 3 3/4 miles in extent. The New Palace, which stood on the west side of the river, opposite to the other, was 7 1/2 miles in extent. It was surrounded with three walls, one within another, with considerable spaces between them. These walls, as also those of the other palace, were embellished with an infinite variety of sculptures, representing all kinds of animals to the life. Among the rest was a curious hunting-piece, in which Semiramis on horseback was throwing her javelin at a leopard, and her husband Ninus piercing a lion. In this last palace were the Hanging Gardens, so celebrated among the Greeks. They contained a square of 400 feet on every side, and were carried up in the manner of several large terraces, one above another, till the height equalled that of the walls of the city. The ascent was from terrace to terrace by stairs ten feet wide. The whole pile was sustained by vast arches raised upon other arches, one above another, and strengthened by a wall, surrounding it on every side, of twenty-two feet in thickness. On the top of the arches were first laid large flat stones, sixteen feet long and four broad; over these was a layer of reeds, mixed with a great quantity of bitumen, upon which were two rows of bricks closely cemented together. The whole was covered with thick sheets of lead, upon which lay the mould of the garden. And all this floorage was contrived to keep the moisture of the mould from running away through the arches. The earth laid thereon was so deep that large trees might take root in it; and with such the terraces were covered, as well as with all other plants and flowers that were proper to adorn a pleasure-garden. In the upper terrace there was an engine, or kind of pump, by which water was drawn up out of the river, and from thence the whole garden was watered. In the spaces between the several arches upon which this whole structure rested were large and magnificent apartments, that were very light, and had the advantage of a beautiful prospect. Amyitis, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar, having been bred in Media (for she was the daughter of Astyages, the king of that country), desired to have something in imitation of her native hills and forests; and the monarch, in order to gratify her, is said to have raised this prodigious structure. Near Babylon was the famous Birs Nimroud. See <ref type="cross" target="crossbabel">Babel</ref>, Tower of.</p>
 <p>Babylon was probably in the zenith of its glory and dominion just before the death of Nebuchadnezzar.

<head orig="The Mudjelibeh or Kasr. (Rich.)">The Mudjelibeh or Kasr. (Rich.)</head>
</figure>  The spoils of Nineveh, Jerusalem, and Egypt had enriched it; its armies had swept like a torrent over the finest countries of the East, and had at this time no longer an enemy to contend with; the arts and sciences, driven from Phoenicia and Egypt, were centred here; and hither the philosophers of the West came to imbibe instruction. The fall of Babylon, before the victorious arms of Cyrus, occurred B.C. 538. The height and strength of the walls had long baffled every effort of the invader. Having understood, at length, that on a certain day, then near approaching, a great annual festival was to be kept at Babylon, when it was customary for the Babylonians to spend the night in revelling and drunkenness, he thought this a fit opportunity for executing a scheme which he had planned. This was no other than to surprise the city by turning the course of the river—a mode of capture of which the Babylonians, who looked upon the river as one of their greatest protections, had not the smallest apprehension. Accordingly, on the night of the feast, he sent a party of his men to the head of the canal, which led to the great lake made by Nebuchadnezzar to receive the waters of the Euphrates while he was facing the banks of the river with walls of brick and bitumen. This party had directions, as soon as it was dark, to commence breaking down the great bank or dam which kept the waters of the river in their place, and separated them from the canal above mentioned; while Cyrus, in the meantime, dividing the rest of <figure id="fig.00178.2">
<head orig="Section of Temple of the Seven Lights.">The Mudjelibeh or Kasr. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> his army, stationed one part at the place where the river entered the city, and the other where it came out, with orders to enter the channel of the river as soon as they should find it fordable. This happened by midnight; for, by cutting down the bank leading to the great lake, and making, besides, openings into the trenches which, in the course of the two years' siege, had been dug around the city, the river was so drained of its water that it became nearly dry. When the army of Cyrus entered the channel from their respective stations on each side of the city, they rushed on ward towards the centre of the place; and finding the gates leading towards the river left open in the drunkenness and negligence of the night, they entered them, and met by concert at the palace before any alarm had been given; here the guards, partaking, no doubt, in the negligence and disorder of the night, were surprised and killed. Soon after, the soldiers of Cyrus, having killed the guard, and meeting with no resistance, advanced towards the banqueting-hall, where they encountered Belshazzar, the ill-fated monarch, and slew him, with his armed followers. See, however, <ref type="cross" target="crosscyrus">Cyrus</ref>, p. 460.</p>
 <p>Under Cyrus, Babylon was reduced to the rank of a provincial city, and having revolted under Darius Hystaspis was severely punished, and by Xerxes plundered and despoiled, after which it steadily decayed. See <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylonia">Babylonia</ref>.

<head orig="Babylonia">Babylonia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βαβυλωνία</foreign>; in the Assyrian inscriptions called <title>Babilu;</title> in the Persian, <title>Babirush</title>). A plain watered by the lower streams of the Tigris and Euphrates, and forming the modern province of Irak-Arabi. The boundaries of Babylonia varied considerably during the different periods of Babylonian and Assyrian power; but in general the northern boundary consisted partly of the Euphrates and its affluents, and partly of the frontier forts established by the monarchs of Assyria and Babylonia, these forts and their outposts forming in all probability the “Median Wall” of the classical writers. The Tigris River formed a natural eastern boundary-line, though the province of Namri (Kurdistan) lying east of that stream was sometimes included in the Chaldaean Empire. The Euphrates with the desert lying east of it was the western limit, while the territory terminated at the Persian Gulf on the south, this body of water in early times having extended further inland than at present. The country so bounded is spoken of in the Old Testament as Shinar, Babel, and “the land of the Chaldees,” and has always been one of the richest and most fertile districts of Western Asia, so that Herodotus (i. 193) speaks 
<pb n="179" /><cb />
 of it as supplying one third of the grain produced by the whole Persian Empire—a fact to which the inscriptions bear witness. A magnificent system of artificial irrigation enhanced this natural productiveness, a network of canals having extended over the entire territory, some of them being still navigable, and the greatest of them—the Nar Malka, which connected the Tigris with the Euphrates —having been used as late as A.D. 700.</p>
 <p>Babylonia was divided into several provinces of varying number and extent at different periods. The chief division was into the two large provinces of Sumir (Shinar) or South Babylonia, and Akkad or North Babylonia, which latter extended from the city of Babylon to the Assyrian frontier. Babylon was the capital of Sumir, and the double city Sippara-Akkad (Agade) on both banks of the Euphrates was the capital of North Babylonia. Minor divisions were Gan-Duniyas, Edina (Eden), Gambulu (Afadj) and Mat Kaldu, the land of the Chaldaeans on the Persian Gulf.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Ethnology and Civilization</hi>.—Babylonia was a land of mixed races, as is testified both by the sacred and profane writers of antiquity, and by the heterogeneous character of its linguistic and monumental remains. The first population was Ugro-Finnic in its racial affiliations, as is seen by the statues of this period, which exhibit features of a pure Tartar type, with doliocephalic skulls, high cheek-bones, and slanting eyes. This type is ethnically altered to the Proto-Medes and to the Elamites of Susiana. The name of Sumero-Akkadians has been applied to this people, who originally came from the mountains to the northeast, whence the name <title>Akkadai</title>, “mountaineers.” At the time of their immigration into Babylonia they are believed to have brought with them the elements of civilization. Not long after them, the Semites entered Babylonia, their type also appearing in the glyptic remains; and later, other ethnic elements were added to the population by the natural operations of war and commerce. That the Semitic immigrants ultimately attained to a high degree of influence in the land is seen in the fact that as early as B.C. 3800 we find a Semitic line of kings, under Sargon of Akkad, ruling in North Babylonia.</p>
 <p>The Babylonian people were possessed of a civilization whose greatness has only of late been properly appreciated; for the meagre notices in Herodotus and other ancient writers give little more than a faint suggestion of the truth. The recovery and decipherment in recent times of many thousands of inscribed tablets from the libraries of the oldest cities of Babylonia, give us a means of reconstructing a very accurate picture of the sociology of their ancient life, and one more clear in its details than that given us by the records of almost any other ancient people, except perhaps of Egypt.</p>
 <p>The government was despotic, and of a typically Oriental type. The laws were administered by supreme judges under whom were ordinary judges, who sat in the gates of the temple and at the great gate of the city to hear causes, and gave judgment in strict conformity with precedent, the chief punishments being fines, loss of civic rights, imprisonment, and death. Appeals could be made to the king. The chief taxes were the “king's tax,” or tax on all property; the “army tax”; and the tax levied, like the English “ship-money” of former <cb /> <figure id="fig.00179">
<head orig="Babylonian Brick, with Cuneiform Inscription.">Babylonian Brick, with Cuneiform Inscription.</head>
</figure> times, upon certain districts for ships. Local taxes were temple-tithes (<hi rend="italic">esritum</hi>), the first-fruit tax, the sheep tax, and a tax for the maintenance of roads and canals. A silver currency was employed (talents, manehs, shekels, paras), coined money having been introduced in the reign of Darins. These early coins were perhaps the tetradrachma (q. v.) of the Athenian Greeks.</p>
 <p>Women occupied a favourable position, especially after marriage, which was effected by both a religious and a civil ceremony. Offences against a mother were severely punished, sometimes even by mutilation. Women could own slaves and other property in their own right, and could even engage in business. All Chaldaeans of free birth were educated. Slaves were protected by law against harsh treatment from their masters; they could own property; and in fact were often taught trades and other self-supporting occupations by their owners.</p>
 <p><ref type="cross" target="crossart">Art</ref>, Literature, and Manufactures.—The recent explorations of Rassam at Sippara and of De Sarzec at Tel-lô have added immensely to our knowledge of Chaldaean art, which had hitherto been represented by a few engraved cylinders and gems. The statues discovered by these gentlemen have much artistic merit. The largest is nearly life-size, is accurate in its anatomy, and is carved in hard green diorite. Another even more remarkable piece of workmanship is a head cut in red porphyry, the execution making it evident that tools of rare excellence must have been used. Several bronze statuettes attest a knowledge of the art of casting metals. Many talismans and amulets have been found, the stones selected by the lapidaries being green and red jasper, haematite, chalcedony, crystal, carnelian, lapis-lazuli, sardonyx, and onyx. Music was cultivated, as the sculptors prove by their representations of the harp, cymbals, and other instruments.</p>
 <p>Among the Sumero-Akkadian population, the scribe caste contained many members of high rank, and literature in consequence was highly esteemed. As has been already stated, every free Babylonian had a certain amount of education, including a knowledge of tablet writing. Libraries were common, and tablets have been found directing the student how to ask for such works as he needed from the libraries; whence it appears that a very careful system of cataloguing prevailed. Various schools of literature are noted as having existed, 
<pb n="180" /><cb />
 each influenced by local schools of thought. In the most ancient school of Eridhu, for example, magic was cultivated, with the result that many works on magic and its cognate subjects were written and compiled, among them the series of tablets known as the “books of spells relating to diseases of the head,” and having a remarkable resemblance to the Atharvaveda or Black-Veda of the Aryans. The school of Erech produced the epic poem of Gizdhubar, consisting of twelve books arranged according to the twelve signs of the zodiac. An admirable specimen of Babylonian literature is a tablet, of which both Assyrian and Babylonian versions exist, describing the war in heaven between Merodach (Marduk) and the demon Tiamat. This tablet came from the library of the Temple of Nebo at Borsippa. Besides poetry and magic, the remains of these great libraries have yielded specimens of historical writing, legal, geographical, and religious composition, and tréatises on astrology, divination, astronomy, and mythology, besides fables and proverbs. The greater part of the Chaldaean classics were copied by the Assyrians under Assur-bani-pal, and thus became a part also of the literature of the Northern Empire. See <ref type="cross" target="crossassyria">Assyria</ref>.</p>
 <p>The natural products of Babylonia were very numerons, comprising, besides corn and other cereals, many kinds of fruits, such as grapes and melons, and also vegetables—sesame, onions, garlic, cucumbers, etc. Trades were varied, and the tablets make especial mention of weaving, dyeing, pottery, building, and many other mechanical arts.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Chronology and History</hi>.—Hitherto students of Babylonia have been almost entirely dependent upon the fragmentary portions of the Canon of Kings, drawn up by the Graeco-Chaldaean priest <ref type="cross" target="crossberosus">Berosus</ref> (q.v.), about B.C. 268; but these lists are now confirmed and superseded by Babylonian Canon inscriptions dating from the sixth century before our era. The documents are: (1) a Canon of Kings by their dynasties, extending from B.C. 2200 until B.C. 647, partly mutilated, but capable of restoration;</p>
 <p>(2) the Tablet of Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia, which gives the names of the Babylonian kings from about B.C. 1800 to B.C. 732;</p>
 <p>(3) a Chronicle Tablet giving the chief events in Babylonia, the month and day being given in most cases, from B.C. 747 to B.C. 660; and</p>
 <p>(4) a collection of dated contract tablets extending from B.C. 680 to B.C. 150. This unequalled series of chronological documents gives an almost complete sequence to Babylonian history, and although there are still <seg lang="la">lacunae</seg>, the basis is now much more sure than when we were dependent solely upon the secondhand statements of Ctesias and Berosus.</p>
 <p>It is now evident, from the monuments and inscriptions which have been obtained from the traditionally oldest cities of Chaldaea, that the civilization of the ancient people of Babylonia has an antiquity surpassing that of ancient Egypt. The earliest monument of which we can accurately fix the date is a stone whorl in the British Museum, brought from Sepharvaim by Mr. Rassam. It is an oval-shaped stone, inscribed in what is called <seg lang="la">line</seg> writing—that is, writing in which the characters are formed more by lines than by the ordinary wedges, a style that goes back to a time when the hieroglyphic or pictorial system of writing was beginning to be discontinued. The king's name inscribed is that of Sargon I., king of Akkad, who <cb /> is now universally assigned to the remote antiqurty of B.C. 3800, and other inscriptions of this distant period are to be found in other European museums. Older still, in all probability, are the very archaic records found by M. de Sarzec at Tel-lô, in the neighbourhood of Erech, which, written in the ancient agglutinative dialect of the Sumero-Akkadian inhabitants, must precede the Semitic inscriptions of the northern kingdom of Sargon and his successors. These early inscriptions are mostly of a very short character, containing little more than the names and titles of the kings who ruled the cities, but at the same time they afford us information as to the state of civilization existing in Chaldaea nearly 4000 years before the Christian era. The Empire had not become one consolidated whole, and polyarchy was the most prevalent form of government, each city being ruled by its local king. Thus, Sargon was king of Akkad, and especially styles himself king of “the city.” Ur-bahu and Dungi were rulers of Ur, and others held sway in the cities of Eridhu, Larsa, and Babylon. Some of these early rulers claim the titles of king of Sumir (Shinar) and Akkad, a division which in after-time had the geographical signification of North and South Babylonia, but which in the earlier ages are certainly rather to be regarded as ethnic than local divisions of this early population. Babylon, though always one of the most important cities of the empire, was not the earliest capital, for the cradle of Chaldaean civilization was in the region of the south. Here all the ancient legends connected with Gizdhubar as Nimrod are located, and find their centre in the city of Urn-ki, the Erech of Genesis, the name of which means “the city of the land,” or capital.</p>
 <p>The next most important city in this southern region was Ur, the sacred city of the Moon-god, the ruins of which are marked by the mound of Mugheir, on the west bank of the Euphrates, the city from which Abram came. Larsa (Senkereh), the Ellasar of Gen. xiv.; Sergul or Kulunu, the Calneh of Genesis, now known as the site of Zerghul on the Shat-el-Hie; and Eridhu, the most sacred city of South Babylonia, called frequently the “Holy City,” were all seats of local rulers.</p>
 <p>The first ruler who succeeded in combining those various city kingdoms into one consolidated whole was Ur-bahu, whose reign must be placed about B.C. 2700. This ruler restored temples in nearly all the above-mentioned cities, and appointed “priest viceroys” to rule in them. He was succeeded by his son Dungi, who has left us a large number of inscriptions. Already Chaldaean civilization had made great progress and was far advanced, and the sciences, especially mathematics and astronomy, were studied; while the ships of Chaldaea navigated the Persian Gulf. The first really historical chronicle belongs to this period, and is found on a statue of Gudea, which shows the Babylonians already at war with Elam and the nations to the west. The wars with Elam form the chief features of the history of this period. In B.C. 2280 a powerful confederation of Elamites under Kudurnakhundi invaded South Chaldaea, and sacked the capital, Erech, carrying away the statue of the divine patroness Nana or Istar. This dynasty lasted until about B.C. 2120, and was very powerful, as shown by the numerous inscriptions of the kings found in various parts of Babylon. Of the kings of this period two are specially important 
<pb n="181" /><cb />
  — viz., Kudur-mabug, who appears to have been lord-paramount of the confederation of kings, and who claimed the title of “lord of the west,” or Syria; and his son, Eri-aku, who was ruler of Larsa. This latter ruler is almost universally identified by Assyriologists with the Arioch, king of Ellasar, mentioned in Gen. xiv. This dynasty was overthrown by the powerful usurper, King Khammuragas, who appears not to have been of native Babylonian origin, but rather a Kassite or Cosscan who had settled in the land and availed himself of this period of depression to seize the throne. This Kassite dynasty is one of the most important periods in Babylonian history, as great political changes took place at this time. It was at this time that Babylon began to assume its position as the capital of the whole Empire. Khammuragas rebuilt the temples of Bel at Babylon, Nebo in Borsippa, and restored several of the sacred edifices in South Babylonia—at Ur, Erech, and Larsa —which had suffered at the hands of the Elamite invaders. His greatest public work, however, was the construction of a canal called the river of Khammuragas, “joy of men,” which there is little doubt was the Nar Malka, or Royal River of the classics. This canal crossed North Babylonia, passing through Sippara, and is now represented by the Yusifieh Canal, one of the few ancient canals navigable at the present day. This dynasty lasted about 180 years, the founder himself ruling fortyfive. The very numerous collection of inscriptions of this period in the British Museum shows that at this time Babylonia was occupied by a much mixed population, consisting of Sumero - Akkadians, Elamites, Kassites, and a large Semitic element. The Semites appear principally as traders and merchants. <figure id="fig.00181">

 <p>The three succeeding dynasties, extending over a period of about 600 years, consisted of a mixture of Semitic and non-Semitic princes, who ruled with Babylon as capital. The history of this period is chiefly to be derived from the Tablet of Synchronous History, and only a few Babylonian records of <cb /> the period have been preserved. One of the most important is the memorial stone of Nebuchadnezzar I., B.C. 1150—a usurper who seized the throne and waged war against the rising Empire of Assyria. In this inscription the king records the result of a campaign against the Elamite chiefs in the region of Namri or Kurdistan, and on the banks of the Ulai River, on which the city of Shushan was afterwards built. The description of the campaign undertaken in the hot summer months is extremely graphic for so ancient a document: “In the month Tammuz he took the road; the rocks were burning and scorched like fire; from the gardens was burned all vegetation; there was no water in the springs, and cut off were the drinking-places; the strength of the great horses wearied, and to the warlike hero his courage returned.” The writer then describes the battle, in which the Babylonians were undoubtedly worsted, and only saved from complete defeat by the aid of the governor of an adjacent city who refused to surrender to the Elamites. In return for this the city has a charter of freedom granted it, declaring it free from taxes and from the usual levy for men in time of war.</p>
 <p>The history is, after this date, chiefly to be derived from Assyrian sources, and it is not until the time of Nabunazir, the Nabonassar of the Canon of Ptolemy, that we have any complete sequence of Babylonian history. Our information is now chiefly derived from the important, but unfortunately fragmentary, Chronicle Tablet already spoken of. Nabonassar, whose reign forms an important epoch in Babylonian history, ascended the throne in B.C. 747, and ruled for fourteen years. During his reign the country was twice invaded by the Assyrians, and, though they claim the victory, they do not seem to have shaken the king on his throne. Nadinu (the Nadinos of Ptolemy), who succeeded to his father's throne in B.C. 734, only ruled for two years, when one of the popular revolts unseated him and placed Ukinziru (the Chimzoros of Ptolemy) on the throne. In the third year the country was invaded by the armies of Tiglath-pileser III., king of Assyria, who drove the Babylonian king from his capital into the marshes of South Babylonia, where he found him and put him to death, ascending his throne under the Babylonian name of Pulu or Pul. This conquest of Babylonia, in B.C. 729, was a very important event in the history of the Kingdom, for it brought the two courts of the north and south kingdoms once more into close relationship. The death of Shalmaneser IV., king of Assyria, and the usurpation of the throne by Sargon the Tartan in B.C. 722, was the opportunity seized by the Babylonians for once more becoming independent, under the leadership of a prince of very ancient descent— Merodach-baladan II. This prince was one of the most popular rulers of the middle Babylonian Kingdom, and was supported by all classes of the people as well as by the Elamite court, who were the most powerful opponents of Assyria. For twelve years the wars in Syria and other parts of the Empire kept the Assyrians from despatching sufficiently strong forces to the south to crush this powerful prince. In B.C. 712, Sargon was purposing to march into Babylonia, when a counteraction was caused by the Babylonian prince sending an embassy to Hezekiah and the other princes of Syria, and raising a revolt which called the invaders a way (2 Kings, xx. 6); but in B.C. 710 the 
<pb n="182" /><cb />
 storm broke, and Sargon captured Babylon, proclaiming himself king. On the assassination of Sargon in B.C. 705, Merodach-baladan returned, and after a reign of some nine months was driven from the land by Sennacherib, seeking refuge in the Elamite provinces on the east shore of the Persian Gulf. For some years Babylonia was now ruled by viceroys and princes appointed by the kings of Assyria, although several native princes attempted revolt. In B.C. 688, Sennacherib, after a very severe campaign, in which he defeated the allied Elamites and Babylonians, became sovereign of the two kingdoms. His son and successor, Esarhaddon, attempted to carry out a policy of a more conciliatory kind, and divided his time between the two courts; but the violent opposition of Egypt in Syria weakened his power, and the Elamites and Babylonians constantly harassed him. Shortly before his death he appointed his son Samas-sum-yukin (the Saosduchinos of Ptolemy) ruler, which appointment was confirmed by his son and successor Assur-bani-pal. This prince, tempted by the intrigue of the Babylonian priests, revolted against his brother, and was defeated after a terrible war, in which Babylon, Sippara, and Borsippa were besieged, and burned himself in his palace, B.C. 647. Kandalanu, who succeeded him, was little more than a viceroy, depending in every way upon the Ninevite court, although tablets are dated in his reign. On the disruption of the Assyrian Empire after the death of Assur-banipal, the throne of Babylon was seized by Nabuabla-utzar, or Nabopolassar, the general of the Babylonian garrison, who had married a Median princess, and was himself, no doubt, of collateral descent from the royal line of Babylonian kings.</p>
 <p>The general disruption of the states of Western Asia which took place in B.C. 625, subsequent upon the inroad of a large mass of Aryan and other invaders from the east, afforded the Babylonians an opportunity for throwing off the hated yoke of Assyria, and Nabopolassar was proclaimed king in B.C. 625. He was succeeded in B.C. 604 by his son Nebuchadnezzar, one of the greatest sovereigns who ever ruled over the ancient Empire. During a long reign of forty-three years the prince succeeded in recovering the long-lost provinces of the kingdom, and once more making Babylon queen of nations. He not only restored the Empire and rebuilt Babylon, but almost every temple and edifice throughout the land underwent restoration at his hands. It is an astonishing fact that not a single mound throughout Babylonia has as yet been opened by the explorers which has not been found to contain bricks, cylinders, or tablets inscribed with his name. In B.C. 599, he captured Jerusalem, and sent Jehoiakim captive to Babylon; and eleven years later, owing to the still disturbed state of the kingdom (B.C. 588), he destroyed the city, and removed most of the inhabitants to Chaldaea. Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded in B.C. 561 by his son Evil-merodach, who released Jehoiakim, but was murdered by his brother-in-law NergalSharezer, who was the <hi rend="italic">rab makhu</hi>, or “chief seer,” of one of the temples. His reign lasted until B.C. 556, his son Labasi-Kudar (the Laborasoarchad of Ptolemy) only ruling a few months. The throne was in B.C. 556 usurped by a powerful and active prince, Nabu-naid or Nabonidus, the son of a “chief seer,” whose reign is the most important, next to that of Nebuchadnezzar, in later Babylonian history. <cb /> The inscriptions of this king are found in almost all temples, and some of them contain important historical facts. In a cylinder found at Sippara the king records his restoration of the temple at Kharran, which was destroyed by the Scythians, and in his sixth year, B.C. 549, he records the overthrow of Astyages, king of the Medes, and the capture of Ecbatana by <ref type="cross" target="crosscyrus">Cyrus</ref> (q.v.). In the king's seventeenth year the whole land of Babylonia was in revolt against him for neglecting the duties of court and religion, leaving all to his son Belshazzar. During the summer of this year Cyrus invaded Babylonia, advancing from the neighbourhood of the modern Bagdad, and reaching Sippara on the fourteenth day of Tammuz (June), which the garrison yielded without fighting. Two days later, Tammuz 16, Babylon was taken in the same manner. Cyrus appointed Gobryas ruler. Three months later, Nabonidus, who was a prisoner, died, and after a week's mourning by the people was buried on the fourth day of Nisan, B.C. 538. Babylonia now became a Persian province, and under the rule of Cyrus (B.C. 538-529) and Cambyses (529-521) it appears to have been peaceful. On the accession to the throne of Darius, son of Hystaspes, the old rebellious spirit once more asserted itself, and for three years (521-519), the city held out against the Persians under Nadinta-Bel, who claimed to be Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabonidus. Again, in B.C. 513, the city revolted under Arakha, an Armenian.</p>
 <p>With the overthrow of the Persian monarchy Babylonia came under the short-lived dominion of Alexander the Great, who died in the capital (B.C. 323). Seleucus I., to whom it had been promised at the conference of Triparadisus, contested and won the possession of it from Antigonus (B.C. 312). About B.C. 140, it was taken from the Syrian monarchs by the Parthians. It came into the hands of the Romans only temporarily, first under Trajan (A.D. 114); under Septimius Severus (A.D. 199); and, again, under Julian (A.D. 363). When in 650 the successors of Mohammed put an end to the new Persian monarchy of the Sassanides, the province of Babylonia, where Bagdad was built (762-766), became the seat of the califs till 1258. Since 1638, when the Turks, for the second time, took it from the Persians, it has been under the dominion of Turkey, divided into the pachalics of Bagdad and Basra.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Religion</hi>.—During its long history many changes took place in the religion of Babylonia. The primitive Sumero-Akkadians had a sort of fetich-worship, regarding every object of nature as the abode of a spirit or living principle (Zî) which governed its relationship to man. The priests of this religion were a class of exorcists dealing only with the malevolent powers of nature— sickness, disease, and others hostile to the life of man. From the libraries of Nineveh the liturgies of these priests have been recovered in the form of magical formulas, incantations, and hymns, from which it appears that the first gods of the SumeroAkkadian theogony are the Spirit of Heaven and the Spirit of Earth—the <title>Dingri</title>, or Creators—the parents of all the other gods. These other gods are very numerous, each locality having its own local pantheon, but in subordination to some one divine patron of the city.</p>
 <p>One of the earliest seats of the Babylonian worship was Eridhu on the Persian Gulf, the seat of 
<pb n="183" /><cb />
 the worship of Ea, the “lord of the waves” as well as “lord of laws,” and identified with the mysterious fish-divinity of <ref type="cross" target="crossberosus">Berosus</ref> (q.v.), who relates that he taught the early inhabitants of the land the elements of civilization. The wife of Ea was Dav-kina, the “lady of the earth.” The pair had a son, Tammuz, “the only-begotten,” whose worship is united to that of his sister, Istar, who is also his consort. Next in importance came, among the local deities, the god Mul-lil (Belus or Bel of the Semites), whose sacred city was Nipur (Niffer). He it was who, according to one version of the story of the Deluge, destroyed mankind. His name means “lord of ghost-land,” and his wife, Ninkigat or Allat, is the “lady of ghost-land.” Their child was Namtar, the demon of fever and goddess of fate, who controls the agencies of disease. <figure id="fig.00183">

</figure></p>
 <p>After the Semitic influence began to prevail, especially in the northern cities, Samas, the sungod, assumes great importance. Many cities had their own local sun-god or solar hero; and in Sippara, where stood the Temple of E Bábara (The House of Lustre), this worship attained its highest development. The great Semitic prince Sargon I. (B.C. 3800) did much to advance the cult of the sun, which as it spread over Chaldaea brought about a gradual change in the religion of the country, resulting in an amalgamation of the Semitic and Akkadian systems. Thus grew up the worship of Bel-Merodach (Marduk) who gradually, from being only a local sun-god, became the great national deity, as Assur was of the Assyrians, so completely overshadowing all the other divinities that the later faith of Babylonia approaches a pure monotheism. His temple, which stood on the eastern side of Babylon, was one of the wonders of the world. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylon">Babylon</ref>.) Other divinities of the later religion are Zirpanit, the wife of Merodach; Nebo (see <ref type="cross" target="crossassyria">Assyria</ref>) with his spouse Tasmit; Ninep, the god of war; Nergal, the god of death; and Gibil, the fire-god.</p>

<head orig="Baiae">Baiae</head>

 <p> A city of Campania, on a small bay west of Neapolis, and opposite Puteoli. It was originally a village, but the numerous advantages of its situation soon rendered it much frequented and famous. Its foundation is ascribed in mythology to Baius, one of the companions of Odysseus. The cause of the rapid increase of Baiae lay in the fruitfulness of the surrounding country, in the beauty of its own situation, in the rich supply of shell and other fish which the adjacent waters afforded, and, above all, in the hot mineral springs which flowed from the neighbouring mountains and formed a chief source of attraction to invalids. Baiae was first called Aquae Cumanae. Numerous villas graced the surrounding country, and many were likewise built on artificial moles extending a great distance into the sea. It is now, owing to earthquakes and inundations of the sea, a mere waste compared with what it once was. The modern name is Baia. Many remains of the ancient villas may be seen beneath the water. The classics of the imperial age teem with allusions

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek Baths</hi>.—Bathing was a practice familiar to the Greeks of both sexes from the earliest times, both in fresh water and salt. Thus, Nausicaa, daughter of Alcinoüs, <cb /> king of Phaeacia, goes out with her attendants to wash her clothes; and after the task is done she bathes herself in the river ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 6. 58" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>vi. 58</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 65" default="NO"> Od., 65</bibl>). Odysseus, who is conducted to the same spot, strips and takes a bath, while Nausicaa and her servants stand aside. Warm springs were also resorted to for the purpose of bathing. The <foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια λουτρά</foreign> shown by Hephaestus or Athené to Heracles are celebrated by the poets. Pindar speaks of the hot baths of the nymphs, and Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22. 149" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxii. 149</bibl>) celebrates one of the streams of the Scamander for its warm temperature. Bathing in rivers or the sea (<foreign lang="greek">ψυχρολουτεῖν</foreign>) was always common for the young. Not to know how to read and to swim were proverbial marks of the ignoramus. A plunge in the Eurotas always sufficed for the Lacedaemonians (Schol. on <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 36</bibl>). There appears to have been a swimming-bath (<foreign lang="greek">κολυμβήθρα</foreign>) at Athens in the time of Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 453" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>453</bibl>D).</p>
 <p>The artificial warm bath was taken in a vessel called <foreign lang="greek">ἀσάμινθος</foreign> by Homer, and <foreign lang="greek">ἔμβασις</foreign> by Athenaeus. It was no doubt of wood or marble, as the epithet <foreign lang="greek">εὔξεστος</foreign> is applied to it ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 48" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 48</bibl>), and in the case of Menelaus's Egyptian presents ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 128" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 128</bibl>) it was of silver. It would appear from the description of the bath administered to Odysseus in the palace of Circé, that this vessel did not contain water itself, but was only used for the bather to sit in while the warm water was poured over him, which was heated in a large caldron or tripod, under which the fire was placed, and when sufficiently warmed was taken out in other vessels and poured over the head and shoulders of the person who sat in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀσάμινθος</foreign>. Where cleanliness merely was the object sought, cold bathing was adopted, which was considered as most bracing to the nerves; but after violent bodily exertion or fatigue warm water was made use of, in order to refresh the body and relax the over-tension of the muscles. Hesiod ( <bibl n="Cic. Op. 754" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Op.</title>754</bibl>) protests against men elaborately cleaning (<foreign lang="greek">φαιδρύνεσθαι</foreign>) their bodies with effeminate baths<bibl n="Cic. Op. 1." default="NO" valid="yes"> Op., i.</bibl> e. those of high temperature, which shows that this luxury had begun in his day; and in Homer's time constant indulgence in the warm bath was considered as a mark of luxury and effeminacy ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 8. 249" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>viii. 249</bibl>). The use of the warm bath was preceded by bathing in cold water ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10. 576" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>x. 576</bibl>). The later custom of plunging into cold water after the warm bath mentioned by Aristides (vol. i. <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orat.2</bibl>, <title>Sacr. Serm.</title> p. 515), who wrote in the second century of our era, was no doubt borrowed from the Romans.</p>
 <p>After bathing both sexes anointed themselves with oil, in order that the skin might not be left harsh and rough, especially after warm water. The use of precious unguents (<foreign lang="greek">μύρα</foreign>) was unknown at that early period. In the heroic ages, as well as in later times, refreshments were usually taken after the bath ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 6. 97" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>vi. 97</bibl>).</p>
 <p>At Athens the frequent use of the public baths was regarded by strict moralists in the time of Socrates and Demosthenes as a mark of luxury and effeminacy; thus it is a sign of demoralization on the part of a ship's crew. Accordingly Phocion was said to have never bathed in a public bath, and Socrates to have made use of it very seldom. It was, however, only the warm baths to which objection was made, and which in ancient times were not allowed to be built within the city (Athen. i. 18 b); for the Greeks did not at all approve of people being dirty; only cleanliness, 
<pb n="186" /><cb />
 they thought, should be attained by the use of cold water.</p>
 <p>The baths (<foreign lang="greek">βαλανεῖα</foreign>) were either public (<foreign lang="greek">δημόσια, δημοσιεύοντα</foreign>) or private (<foreign lang="greek">ἴδια, ἰδιωτικά</foreign>). The former were the property of the state, but the latter were built by private individuals. Such private baths are mentioned by Plutarch ( <bibl n="Plut. Demetr. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Demetr.</title>24</bibl>). Baths of this kind were probably mostly intended for the exclusive use of the persons to whom they belonged ( <bibl n="Ps. Xen. Const. Ath. 2. 10." default="NO" valid="yes">Ps. Xen. <title>Rep. Ath.</title>ii. 10.</bibl>) There appears to have been a small, almost nominal, charge for the use of the public baths. Thus, in the inscription of Andania (i. 107), the price is fixed at two chalki=1/4 obol.</p>
 <p>We know very little of the baths of the Athenians during the republican period; for the account of Lucian in his <title>Hippias</title> relates to baths constructed after the Roman model. On ancient vases on which persons are represented bathing we seldom find anything corresponding to a modern bath in which persons can stand or sit; but there is always a round or oval basin (<foreign lang="greek">λουτήρ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λουτήριον</foreign>), resting on a stand (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπόστατον</foreign>), by the side of which those who are bathing are represented standing undressed and washing themselves, as is seen in the following illustration taken from Sir W. Hamilton's vases. <figure id="fig.00186">
<head orig="Public Basin for Men. (From a Greek Vase.)">Public Basin for Men. (From a Greek Vase.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>But besides the <foreign lang="greek">λουτῆρες</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λουτήρια</foreign> there were also vessels for bathing, large enough for persons to sit in, which, as stated above, are called <foreign lang="greek">ἀσάμινθοι</foreign> by Homer and <foreign lang="greek">πύελοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μάκτραι</foreign> by the later Greeks. The <foreign lang="greek">λουτήρ</foreign> thus, as we shall see, corresponded to the Roman <seg lang="la">labrum;</seg> the <foreign lang="greek">πύελος</foreign> to the <seg lang="la">solium</seg> or <seg lang="la">alveus.</seg></p>
 <p>In the baths there was also a kind of sudorific or vapour bath called <foreign lang="greek">πυρία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πυριατήριον</foreign>, which is mentioned as early as the time of Herodotus (iv. 75). Among the chambers of the Greek bathing establishment was the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλειπτήριον</foreign>, Lat. <seg lang="la">unctorium.</seg> Lucian ( <title>Hipp.</title>p. 73) speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀποδυτήριον</foreign> with its <foreign lang="greek">ἱματιοφυλακοῦντες</foreign> (<seg lang="la">capsarii</seg>); but as they seem to be unknown to Aristotle, they were probably introduced from Rome. Hence Aristotle tells us that those who stole clothes from the baths were punishable with death. As the baths most frequently adjoined the gymnasia and palaestra, one of the rooms of these latter buildings served the purpose of undressing-room ( <bibl n="Ps. Xen. Const. Ath. 2. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Ps. Xen. <title>Rep. Ath.</title>ii. 10</bibl>). About these rooms the <foreign lang="greek">τριβαλλοί</foreign> used to loaf, looking out for an invitation. We hear of wrestling and playing the cottabus, besides a great deal of conversation going on in the baths. To sing there was considered the part of a boor <cb /> (<bibl n="Thphr. Char. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Theophr.  <title>Char.</title>4</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Either the bath or simple anointing of the body generally formed part of the business of dressing for dinner. It was generally taken shortly before the <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>, or principal meal of the day. Epictetus (<title>Diss.</title> i. 1, 29) mentions noon as the hour, while voluptuaries bathed repeatedly. It was the practice to take first a warm or vapour, and afterwards a cold bath, though in the time of Homer the cold bath appears to have been taken first and the warm afterwards. The cold water was usually poured on the back or shoulders of the bathers by the <foreign lang="greek">βαλανεύς</foreign> or his assistants, who are called <foreign lang="greek">παραχύται</foreign>. The vessel from which the water was poured was called <foreign lang="greek">ὑδρία</foreign>; there is mention also of the <foreign lang="greek">ἁρύταινα</foreign>, which must have been much smaller. Bathing establishments for women existed among the Greeks, whether belonging to the state or maintained by private enterprise. We learn from Varro (<title>L. L.</title> ix. 68) that the earliest Greek <seg lang="la">balneum</seg> in Rome contained a department for women.</p>
 <p>Roulez (<title>Choix de Vases peints du Musée de Leyde</title>, pl. xix. 1) gives us a vase painting of a bath in a palaestra, where two shower baths descend on men from spouts shaped like panthers' heads; and Panofka (<title>Bilder antiken Lebens</title>, pl. xviii. 9) shows us a bath for women similarly arranged, while an unpublished vase painting in the Louvre represents a <foreign lang="greek">κολυμβήθρα</foreign>, or swimming-bath for women. <figure id="fig.00186.2">
<head orig="Shower Baths for Women. (From a Greek Vase.)">Shower Baths for Women. (From a Greek Vase.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The persons who bathed probably brought with them strigils, oil, and towels, or had them carried by a slave. The strigil, which was called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">στλεγγίς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ξύστρα</foreign>, was usually made of iron, but sometimes also of other materials. Pollux says (x. 181), “The cloth which is worn by women round their loins when taking the bath, or by the men who bathe them, is called <foreign lang="greek">ᾤα λουτρίς</foreign>.” The Greeks also used different materials for cleansing or washing themselves in the bath, to which the general name of <foreign lang="greek">ῥύμμα</foreign> was given, and which were supplied by the <foreign lang="greek">βαλανεύς</foreign>. This <foreign lang="greek">ῥύμμα</foreign> usually consisted of a lye made of lime or wood-ashes (<foreign lang="greek">κονία</foreign>), of nitrum, and of fuller's earth (<foreign lang="greek">γῆ κιμωλία</foreign>, <title>Ran.</title> 710 and Schol.;  <bibl n="Plato Rep. 4. 430" default="NO">Plato <title>Rep.</title>iv. 430</bibl>A).</p>
 <p>Among the Greeks a person was always bathed at birth, marriage, and after death; whence it is said of the Dardanians, an Illyrian people, that they bathe only thrice in their lives—at birth, marriage, and after death. The water in which the bride was bathed at Athens was taken from the fountain of Callirrhoë, which was called from the time of Pisistratus <foreign lang="greek">Ἐννεάκρουνος</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The natural warm springs (<foreign lang="greek">θερμὰ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια λουτρά</foreign>) were not only esteemed as sacred to Heracles, but also considered highly medicinal. The hot springs of Aedepsus in Euboea were famed for their healing properties, as also was a cold spring 
<pb n="187" /><cb />
 which flowed for a time (Athen. iii. 73). In later times it became a great resort for pleasure as well as health, especially in the spring.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman Baths</hi>.—The words <seg lang="la">balneae, balineae, balneum, balineum, thermae</seg>, are all commonly translated by our general term “bath” or “baths”; but in the writings of the earlier and better authors they are used with discrimination. <title>Balneum</title> or <hi rend="italic">balineum</hi>, which is derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">βαλανεῖον</foreign>, signifies, in its primary sense, a bath or bathingvessel, such as most persons of any consequence among the Romans possessed in their own houses ( <title>ad Att.</title> ii. 3), and hence the chamber which contained the bath, which is also the proper translation of the word <seg lang="la">balnearium.</seg> The diminutive <seg lang="la">balneolum</seg> is adopted by Seneca ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 86. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>86. 3</bibl>) to designate the bath-room of Scipio, in the villa at Liternum, and is expressly used to characterize the modesty of republican manners as compared with the luxury of his own times. But when the baths of private individuals became more sumptuous, and comprised many rooms instead of the one small chamber described by Seneca, the plural <seg lang="la">balnea</seg> or <hi rend="italic">balinea</hi> was adopted, which still, in correct language, had reference only to the baths of private persons. <title>Balneae</title> and <hi rend="italic">balineae</hi>, which according to Varro (<title>L. L.</title> viii. 25, ix. 41) have no singular number, were the public baths. But this accuracy of diction is neglected by many of the subsequent writers; and even in the time of the Republic, <seg lang="la">balneum</seg> was used for a public bath, but particularly by the poets, among whom <seg lang="la">balnea</seg> is not uncommonly used in the plural number to signify the public baths, since the word <seg lang="la">balneae</seg> could not be introduced in an hexameter verse. <title>Thermae</title> (<foreign lang="greek">θέρμαι</foreign>, “hot springs”) meant properly warm springs, or baths of warm water; but came to be applied to those magnificent edifices which grew up under the Empire, in place of the simple <seg lang="la">balneae</seg> of the Republic, and which comprised within their range of buildings all the appurtenances belonging to the Greek gymnasia, as well as a regular establishment appropriated for bathing ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 233" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 233</bibl>). Writers, however, use these terms without distinction.</p>
 <p>The Romans, in the earlier periods of their history, used the bath but seldom, and only for health and cleanliness, not as a luxury. Thus we learn from Seneca ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 86. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>86. 12</bibl>) that the ancient Romans washed their legs and arms daily and bathed their whole body once a week. The room set apart for this purpose was called <seg lang="la">lavatrina</seg> or <seg lang="la">latrina</seg> (q. v.), and was placed near the kitchen, so that warm water might be easily procured.</p>
 <p>It is not recorded at what precise period the use of the warm bath was first introduced among the Romans; but we learn from Seneca that Scipio had a warm bath in his villa at Liternum; which, however, was of the simplest kind, consisting of a single chamber, just sufficient for the necessary purposes, and without any pretensions to luxury. It was “small and dark,” he says, “after the manner of the ancients.” Seneca also describes the public baths of former times as <seg lang="la">obscura et gregali tectorio inducta;</seg> and while their arrangements were of the simplest kind, aediles of noble birth did not disdain to look after them personally. These were baths of warm <hi rend="italic">water;</hi> but the practice of <ref id="n2" target="ref2"><title></title><title></title></ref> <cb /> heating an apartment with warm air by a hollow underneath the floor, so as to produce a hot-air bath, is stated by Valerius Maximus (ix. 1. 1) and by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 9.  168" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>ix. 168</bibl>) to have been invented by Sergius Orata, who lived in the age of L. Crassus, the orator, before the Marsic War.</p>
 <p>In the time of Cicero, though young people used in summer to bathe in the Tiber, yet the use of baths, both public and private, of warm water and hot air, had become general; and we learn from one of his orations that there were already baths (<title>balneas Senias</title>) at Rome which were open to the public upon payment of a small sum (<title>pro Cael.</title> 25, 61). Besides public baths, others were built by private speculators, who either worked them themselves or leased them out. Sometimes even the State leased out the public baths under certain conditions, touching certain people to be admitted free, hours of opening and closing, height of water, etc. The lessee or worker of a bath (<seg lang="la">balneator</seg>) appears to have stood very low in social estimation ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 4</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Jordan has collected a vast number of the names of the baths from the Regionarii, and they appear to be nearly all called after the possessor, though we find one of Mercurius and one of Diana. There were baths, of course, in the country, and they professed to be quite up to city style—e.g. an inscription has <title>In praediis Aureliae Faustinianae balineus. Lavatur more urbico, et omnis humanitas praestatur</title> (Marini, <title>Atti de' Fratelli Arvali</title>, p. 532, where a similar profession of a <seg lang="la">balneator</seg> is to be found, <seg lang="la">omnia commoda praestantur</seg>). A sign - board, in Orelli 4326, of the Thermae of M. Crassus, offers salt and fresh water baths. These baths, which were worked by private individuals, appear to have been called <seg lang="la">balnea meritoria.</seg> Agrippa added 170 baths to those which existed already in Rome. In the time of Constantine there were no less than 856 in the city, and the Regionarii actually reckon 952 (Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 140).</p>
 <p>In the earlier ages of Roman history a much greater delicacy was observed with respect to bathing, even among the men, than was usual among the Greeks; for, according to Valerius Maximus (ii. 1. 7), it was deemed indecent for a father to bathe in company with his own son after he had attained the age of puberty, or a son-in-law with his father-in-law. But virtue passed away as wealth increased; and when the thermae came into use not only did the men bathe together in numbers, but even men and women stripped and bathed promiscuously in the same bath, as in certain Austrian cities to-day. It is true, however, that the public establishments generally contained separate baths for both sexes adjoining each other, as is seen to have been the case at the baths of Pompeii. Aulus Gellius (x. 3) relates a story of a consul's wife who took a whim to bathe at Teanum (Teano), a small provincial town of Campania, in the men's baths—probably because, in a small town, the female department, like that at Pompeii, was more confined and less convenient than that assigned to the men; and an order was consequently given to the quaestor, M. Marius, to turn the men out. In the Lex Metalli Vipascensis the women have the use of the bath from day break till the seventh hour, the men from the eighth hour till the second hour of the night. If at Rome there were separate establishments for the women, men at any rate appear to have been able to get into 
<pb n="188" /><cb /> 
 them, and they were a possible place for assignations ( <title>A. A.</title> iii. 639);—a passage which further shows that there were small private chambers with baths in them, such as we find in the Stabian baths at Pompeii. But whether the men and women were allowed to use each other's chambers indiscriminately, or some of the public establishments had only one common set of baths for both, the custom prevailed under the Empire of men and women bathing indiscriminately together ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  153" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 153</bibl>). This custom was forbidden by Hadrian ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 18" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>18</bibl>) and by M. Aurelius Antoninus (Capitolin. <title>Anton.</title> 23); and Alexander Severus prohibited any baths common to both sexes (<seg lang="la">balnea mixta</seg>), from being opened in Rome (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 24). Although the practice was not adopted by women of respectability, yet this legislation was not permanently effective, and even the censures of the Fathers of the Christian Church and the canons of councils did not avail to suppress it. Justinian recognizes it as a ground of divorce, <seg lang="la">si forte uxor ita luxuriosa est, ut commune lavacrum cum viris libidinis causa habere audeat.</seg></p>
 <p>When the public baths (<seg lang="la">balneae</seg>) were first instituted, they were only for the lower orders, who alone bathed in public; the people of wealth, as well as those who formed the equestrian and senatorian orders, used private baths in their own houses. But as early even as the time of Inlius Caesar we find no less a personage than the mother of Augustus making use of the public establishments ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>94</bibl>); and in process of time, even the emperors themselves bathed in public with the meanest of the people.</p>
 <p>The baths were opened at sunrise and closed at sunset. The many lamps found in the baths at Pompeii were used for lighting the rooms and the dark passages, according to Nissen, <title>Pomp. Stud.</title> 135, and do not necessarily imply night-bathing. But in the time of Alexander Severus it would appear that the baths were kept open after nightfall. The allusion in Juvenal (vi. 419) probably refers to private baths.</p>
 <p>The price of a bath (<seg lang="la">balneaticum</seg>) was a quadrans, the smallest piece of coined money, from the age <cb /> of Cicero downwards, which was paid to the keeper of the bath (<seg lang="la">balneator</seg>). Children below a certain age were admitted free ( <bibl n="Juv.  2. 152" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.ii. 152</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The passage of Juvenal (vi. 447) which has been quoted to show that women paid no fee should be taken to imply that they paid a higher price than men. So by the Lex Metalli Vipascensis, which has been already referred to, the men pay half an <hi rend="italic">as</hi>, the women an <hi rend="italic">as.</hi> Faustus Sulla gave the people the use of the baths and oil on the day of his father's funeral, and Augustus on his return from Germany gave them baths and barbers for a day. Agrippa opened the baths gratnitously to both men and women for a year, and afterwards gave the people his Thermae. Such munificence was repeated by emperors and also by private individuals.</p>
 <p>The baths were closed when any serious public misfortune happened, just as we should close our theatres; and Suetonius says that the emperor Caligula made it a capital offence to indulge in the luxury of bathing upon any religious holiday. They were originally placed under the superintendence of the aediles, whose business it was to keep them in repair, and to see that they were kept clean and of a proper temperature. In the provinces the same duty seems to have devolved upon the quaestor, as may be inferred from Aulus Gellius (x. 3).</p>
 <p>The time usually assigned by the Romans for taking the bath was the eighth hour, or shortly afterwards ( <bibl n="Mart.  10. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 48</bibl>; xi. 52). Before that time none but invalids were allowed to bathe in public. Vitruvius reckons the hours best adapted for bathing to be from mid-day until about sunset. Spurinna took his bath at the ninth hour in summer and at the eighth in winter; and Martial speaks of taking a bath, when business had been pressing, at the tenth hour, and even later (iii. 36; x. 70).</p>
 <p>When the water was ready and the baths prepared, notice was given by the sound of a bell—<seg lang="la">aes thermarum</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 163" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 163</bibl>). One of these bells, with the inscription <title>Firmi Balneatoris</title>, was found in the Thermae Diocletianae in the year 1548, and came into the possession of the learned Fulvius Ursinus (<title>Append. ad</title> Ciaccon. <title>De Triclin.</title>). A sundial was found in the new baths at Pompeii, and Lucian ( <title>Hipp.</title>p. 8) places in the baths a sundial and a water-clock, with apparently some mechanism for striking the hours attached.</p>
 <p>While the bath was used for health merely or cleanliness, a single one was considered sufficient at a time, and that only when requisite. But the luxuries of the Empire knew no such bounds, and the daily bath was sometimes repeated as many as seven and eight times in succession—the number which the emperor Commodus indulged himself 
<pb n="189" /><cb />
 with. Gordian bathed four or five times a day in summer and twice in winter; the emperor Gallienus six or seven times in summer and twice or thrice in winter. Commodus also took his meals in the bath—a custom which was not confined to a dissolute emperor alone.</p>
 <p>It was the usual and constant habit of the Romans to take the bath after exercise, and previously to their principal meal (<seg lang="la">cena</seg>); but the debauchees of the Empire bathed after eating as well as before, in order to promote digestion, and so to acquire a new appetite for fresh delicacies. Nero is related to have indulged in this practice ( Suet. <title>Nero</title>, p. 27; cf. <bibl n="Juv.  1. 142" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 142</bibl>). This practice of carrying off the effects of gluttony by artificial means of inducing perspiration, which had taken the place of the hard labour and exercise of sterner times, was severely condemned, and sometimes proved fatal. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscena">Cena</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Romans did not content themselves with a single bath of hot or cold water; but they went through a course of baths in succession, in which the agency of air as well as water was applied. It is difficult to ascertain the precise order in which the course was usually taken, if indeed there was any general practice beyond the whim of the individual. Under medical treatment the succession would, of course, be regulated by the nature of the disease for which a cure was sought, and would vary also according to the different practice of different physicians. It is certain, however, that it was a general custom to close the pores and brace the body after the excessive perspiration of the vapour bath either by anointing, or by pouring cold water over the head, or by plunging at once into the <seg lang="la">piscina</seg> or into a river (Auson. <title>Mosell.</title> 341). Musa, the physician of Augustus, is said to have introduced this practice ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 25.  77" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxv. 77</bibl>; cf. <title>Epist.</title> i. 15, 4), which became quite the fashion, in consequence of the benefit which the emperor derived from it, though Dio Cass. (liii. 30) accuses Musa of having artfully caused the death of Marcellus by an improper application of the same treatment. In other cases it was considered conducive to health to pour warm water over the head before the vapour bath, and cold water immediately after it; and at other times warm, tepid, and cold water baths were taken in succession.</p>
 <p>The two physicians Galen and Celsus differ in some respects as to the order in which the baths should be taken—the former recommending first the hot air of the <hi rend="italic">laconicum</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀέρι θερμῷ</foreign>), next the bath of warm water (<foreign lang="greek">ὕδωρ θερμόν</foreign>), afterwards the cold, and finally to be well rubbed (Galen. <title>de Methodo Medendi</title>, x. 10, pp. 708, 709, ed. Kühn); whilst the latter recommends his patients first to sweat for a short time in the tepid chamber (<seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg>), without undressing, then to proceed into the thermal chamber (<seg lang="la">calidarium</seg>), and after having gone through a regular course of perspiration there, not to descend into the warm bath (<seg lang="la">solium</seg>), but to pour a quantity of warm water over the head, then tepid, and finally cold, afterwards to be scraped with the strigil (<seg lang="la">perfricari</seg>), and finally rubbed dry and anointed ( <title>de Med.</title> i. 4). Such, in all probability, was the usual habit of the Romans when the bath was resorted to as a daily source of pleasure, and not for any particular medical treatment; the more so as it resembles in many respects the system of bathing still practised <cb /> among the Orientals, who, as Gell remarks, “succeeded by conquest to the luxuries of the enervated Greeks and Romans.”</p>
 <p>The principal ancient authorities on baths are: Vitruvius (v. 10); Lucian (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππίας ἢ βαλανεῖον</foreign>, a detailed description of a set of baths erected by an architect named Hippias); Pliny the Younger, in the two letters describing his villas; Statius, <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Silv.</title>i. 5</bibl>; Martial (vi. 42, and other epigrams); Seneca (<title>Epist.</title> 51, 56, 86), and Sidonius Apollinaris (<title>Epist.</title> ii. 2).</p>
 <p>But it would be almost hopeless to attempt to arrange the information obtained from these writers were it not for the help afforded us by the extensive ruins of ancient baths—such as the Thermae of Titus, Caracalla, and Diocletian; the Thermae of Pompeii excavated in 1854-58; and numerous public and private baths throughout the whole extent of the Roman Empire, the most important of which are referred to in the list of authorities at the end of this article; but above all the public baths (<seg lang="la">balneae</seg>) of Pompeii, which were excavated in 1824-25. Before describing the details of the Roman public baths, attention may be called to the simpler baths used in private houses, although to a modern these seem extraordinarily elaborate in their arrangements.</p>
 <p>The cut given on the preceding page is a groundplan of the Roman baths at Badenweiler; and though less elaborate than the baths attached to some Pompeian private houses, it is interesting from its compactness and the arrangement of the women's and men's baths. A full account of them is given by Dr. Heinrich Leibnitz, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die römischen Bäder bei Badenweiler</title> (Leipzig, 1860)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The so-called Old Baths, adjoining the Forum at Pompeii, afford an instance of a complete set of public baths so well preserved that in some of the chambers even the ceilings are intact. A ground-plan of these is given on the next page.</p>
 <p>The whole building, which comprises a double set of baths, has six different entrances from the street, one of which, <seg lang="la">b</seg>, gives admission to the smaller set only, which are supposed to have been appropriated to the women, and five others to the male department, of which two, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 2, communicate directly with the furnaces, and the other three, <seg lang="la">a</seg> 3, <seg lang="la">a</seg> 2, <seg lang="la">a</seg>, with the bathing apartments, of which <seg lang="la">a</seg>, the nearest to the Forum, was the principal one; the other two, <seg lang="la">a</seg> 3 and <seg lang="la">a</seg> 2, being on different sides of the building, served for the convenience of those who lived on the north and east sides of the city. Passing through the principal entrance, <seg lang="la">a</seg>, which is removed from the street by a narrow footway surrounding the <seg lang="la">insula</seg> (the outer curb of which is marked upon the plan by the thin line drawn round it), and after descending three steps, the bather finds upon his left hand a small chamber, <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, which contained a water-closet (<seg lang="la">latrina</seg>), and proceeds into a covered portico, <hi rend="italic">g g</hi>, which ran round three sides of an open court—<seg lang="la">atrium</seg> (A)—which was 68 ft. long and 53 ft. broad; and these together formed the vestibule of the baths—<seg lang="la">vestibulum balnearum</seg> ( <title>Pro Cael.</title> 26), in which the servants belonging to the establishment, as well as the attendants of the bathers, waited. There are seats for their accommodation placed underneath the portico (<hi rend="italic">g, g</hi>). This <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> was the exercise ground for the young men, or perhaps served as a promenade for visitors to the baths. Within this court the keeper of the baths (<seg lang="la">balneator</seg>), who exacted 
<pb n="190" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00190">

</figure>
 the <seg lang="la">quadrans</seg> paid by each visitor, was also stationed; and the box for holding the money was found in it. The room <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, which runs back from the portico, might have been appropriated to him; but most probably it was an <seg lang="la">oecus</seg> or <seg lang="la">exedra</seg>, for the convenience of the better classes while awaiting the return of their acquaintances from the interior. <figure id="fig.00190.2">
<head orig="Restoration of Apodyterium of Old Baths. (Overbeck.)">Restoration of Apodyterium of Old Baths. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> In this court, likewise, as being the most public place, advertisements for the theatre, or other announcements of general interest, were posted up, one of which, announcing a gladiatorial show, still remains. At the two sides of the entrance to it were stone seats <hi rend="italic">(scholae). n</hi> is the corridor which conducts from the entrance <seg lang="la">a</seg> 2 into the same vestibule; <seg lang="la">o</seg>, a small cell of similar use to the corresponding one in the opposite corridor, <seg lang="la">d; e</seg>, a passage of communication which leads into the chamber B, the <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg>, a room for undressing; and which is also accessible from the street by the door <seg lang="la">a</seg> 3, through the corridor <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, in which a small niche is observable, which probably served for the station of another <seg lang="la">balneator</seg>, who collected the money from those entering from the north street. In this room, which was 38 ft. long and 22 ft. broad, all the visitors must have met before entering the baths. The <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> probably belonged to the <seg lang="la">frigidarium</seg>, which in Pliny 's villa it adjoined ( <title>Epist.</title> v. 6. 25); though in the great thermae at Rome the <seg lang="la">frigidarium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg> had doubtless each a separate <seg lang="la">apodyterium.</seg> In the <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> the bathers removed their clothing, which was taken in charge by slaves known as <seg lang="la">capsarii</seg>, notorious in ancient times for their dishonesty (<title>Dig.</title> xlvii. 17).</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> was a spacious chamber, with stone seats along two sides of the wall (<hi rend="italic">h, h</hi>). Holes are still visible on the walls, and probably mark the places where the pegs for the bathers' clothes were set. The chamber was lighted by a glass window, and had six doors. One of these doors led to the entrance <seg lang="la">a</seg> 2, one to the entrance <seg lang="la">a</seg> 3, one 
<pb n="191" /><cb />
 to the small room <seg lang="la">i</seg>, one to the furnaces, one to the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> D, while the sixth opened upon the <seg lang="la">frigidarium</seg> C, with its cold plunge-bath (<foreign lang="greek">λουτρόν</foreign>, <seg lang="la">natatio, natatorium, piscina, baptisterium, puteus</seg>).</p>
 <p>The bath in this chamber is of white marble, and is 13 ft. 8 in. in diameter, and about 3 ft. 9 in. deep. It is approached by two marble steps, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
 <p>From the <seg lang="la">frigidarium</seg> the bather who wished to go through the warm bath and sweating process entered the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> D. This <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg>, 33 ft. long by 18 ft. broad, did not contain water either at Pompeii or at the baths of Hippias, but was merely heated with warm air of an agreeable temperature, <figure id="fig.00191">
<head orig="Frigidarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Frigidarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> in order to prepare the body for the great heat of the vapour and warm baths, and, upon returning, to obviate the danger of a too-sudden transition to the open air. In the baths at Pompeii this chamber served likewise as an <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> for those who took the warm bath; for which purpose the fittings-up are evidently adapted, the walls being divided into a number of separate compartments or recesses for receiving the garments when taken off by a series of figures of the kind called <ref type="cross" target="crossatlantes">Atlantes</ref> (q.v.) or Telamones, which project from the walls and support a rich cornice above them. Three bronze benches were also found in the room, which was heated as well by its contignity to the hypocaust of the adjoining chamber, as by a brazier of bronze (<seg lang="la">foculus</seg>), in which the charcoal ashes were still remaining when the excavation was made. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00191.2">
<head orig="Brazier of the Old Baths at Pompeii.">Frigidarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> Sitting and perspiring beside such a brazier was called <seg lang="la">ad flammam sudare</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 82" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>82</bibl>). A representation of it is given in the above illustration. Its whole length was 7 ft., and its breadth 2 ft. 6 in.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> is generally the most highly ornamented room in baths. It was merely a room to sit in and be anointed in. In the Old Baths at Pompeii the floor is mosaic, the arched ceiling adorned with stucco and painting on a coloured ground, the walls red.</p>
 <p>Anointing was performed by slaves called <seg lang="la">unctores</seg> and <seg lang="la">aliptae</seg> (q. v.). It sometimes took place before going to the hot bath, and sometimes after the cold bath, before putting on the clothes, in order to check the perspiration (Galen. x. 49). In some baths is a special room (<hi rend="italic">destrictarium</hi> or <seg lang="la">unctorium</seg>) for this purpose. For an account of the various kinds of oils and scents used by the wealthy, see the fifteenth book of Athenaens, the thirteenth book of the <title>Historia Naturalis</title> of Pliny , and cf.  <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 37." default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>37.</bibl></p>
 <p>From the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> a door opened into E, the <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg>, a chamber 53 ft. long and 17 1/2 ft. wide. Its mosaic floor was directly above the furnace or hypocaust. Its walls also were hollow, forming a great flue filled with heated air. At one end was a round basin (<seg lang="la">labrum</seg>), and at the other a quadrangular bathingplace (<foreign lang="greek">πύελος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">alveus, solium, calida piscina</seg>), approached from the platform (<seg lang="la">schola</seg>) by steps. The <seg lang="la">alveus</seg> was 16 1/2 ft. long, 5 1/2 ft. wide, and 2 ft. deep. The <seg lang="la">labrum</seg> was 7 1/2 ft. in diameter and 8 in. deep, and was raised 3 1/4 ft. from the ground. It held cold water, for pouring upon the bather's head before he left the room. These basins are of marble in the Old Baths, but we hear of <seg lang="la">alvei</seg> of solid silver ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  152" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 152</bibl>). Because of the great heat of the room, the <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg> was but slightly ornamented.</p>
 <p>The Old Baths have no <hi rend="italic">laconicum</hi>, which was a chamber still hotter than the <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg>, and used simply as a sweating-room, having no bath. It was said to have been introduced at Rome by Agrippa (Dio Cass. liii. 27), and was also called <seg lang="la">sudatorium</seg> and <seg lang="la">assa.</seg></p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">suspensurae</seg>, or hanging-floors above the <seg lang="la">hypocaustum</seg>, are described in the following passage from Prof. Middleton's <title>Ancient Rome in 1885</title> (p. 334), from which the illustration on page 193 is taken:</p>
 <p>“Vitruvius's description of the hypocausts, or hollow floors used for heating the hot rooms (<seg lang="la">calidaria</seg>), agrees closely with many existing examples. The lower floor was to be laid with 2 ft. tiles (<seg lang="la">tegulae bipedales</seg>) over a bed of concrete, on this, all over the area of the room, rows of short pillars (<seg lang="la">pilae</seg>) were built to support the upper or ‘hanging floor’ (<seg lang="la">suspensura</seg>). These <seg lang="la">pilae</seg> were to be 2 ft. high, made of <seg lang="la">tegulae bessales</seg>, or tiles 8 in. square, set, not in mortar, but with clay in the

 joints. In existing examples these clay joints have been baked into brick by the action of the fire” (rather “hot air,” for there was not a fire in the <seg lang="la">hypocaustum</seg>, but in the <seg lang="la">hypocausis</seg>). The passages from the furnace to the hypocaust and the flues in the walls appear to have been called <seg lang="la">cuniculi</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 9. 134" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>ix. 134</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> has a passage, <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, communicating <figure id="fig.00192.2">
<head orig="Caldarium of the Old Baths. (Overbeck.)">Caldarium of the Old Baths. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> with the mouth of the furnace <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, called <seg lang="la">praefurnium</seg> or <hi rend="italic">propigneum;</hi> and, passing down that passage, we reach the chamber M, into which the <seg lang="la">praefurnium</seg> projects, and which is entered from the street at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> It was assigned to the <seg lang="la">fornacatores</seg>, or persons in charge of the fires. Of its two staircases, one leads to the roof of the baths, and one to the boilers containing the water. There were three boilers, one of which (<seg lang="la">caldarium vas</seg>) held the hot water; a second, the tepid (<seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg>); and the third, the cold (<seg lang="la">frigidarium</seg>). The warm water was turned into the warm bath by a pipe through the wall, marked on the plan. Underneath the hot chamber was set the circular furnace <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, of more than 7 ft. in diameter, which heated the water and poured hot air into the hollow cells of the <seg lang="la">hypocaustum.</seg> It passed from the furnace under the first and last of the caldrons by two flues, which are marked upon the plan. The boiler containing hot water was placed immediately over the furnace; and, as the water was drawn out from thence, it was supplied from the next, the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg>, which was raised a little higher and stood a little way off from the furnace. It was already considerably heated from its contiguity to the furnace and the hypocaust below it, so that it sup<figure id="fig.00192.3"><head>Boiler, <seg lang="la">miliarium.</seg> (From Pompeii.)</head></figure> plied the deficiency of the former without materially diminishing its temperature; and the vacuum in this last was again filled up from the farthest removed, which contained the cold water received directly from the square reservoir seen behind them—a principle which has at length been introduced into the modern bathing establishments. The boilers themselves no longer remain, but the impressions which they have left in the mortar in which they were imbedded are clearly visible, and enable us to ascertain their respective positions and dimensions, the first of which, the <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg>, is represented on preceding page. Such coppers or boilers appear to have been called <seg lang="la">miliaria</seg>, from similarity of shape to a mile-stone (Pallad. i. 40; v. 8).</p>
 <p>Behind the coppers there is another corridor leading into the court or <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> (K) appropriated to the servants of the bath, and which has also the convenience of an immediate communication with the street by the door at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 2.</p>
 <p>We now proceed to the adjoining set of baths, which were assigned to the women. The entrance is by the door <seg lang="la">b</seg>, which conducts into a small vestibule, <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, and thence into the <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> H, which, like the one in the men's bath, has a seat (<seg lang="la">pulvinus, gradus</seg>) on either side built up against the wall. This opens upon a cold bath, J, answering to the <seg lang="la">natatio</seg> of the other set, but of much smaller dimensions. There are four steps on the inside to descend into it. Opposite to the door of entrance into the <seg lang="la">apodyterium</seg> is another doorway which leads to the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> H, which also communicates with the thermal chamber F, on one side of which is a warm bath in a square recess, and at the farther extremity the <seg lang="la">labrum.</seg> The floor of this chamber is suspended, and its walls perforated for flues, like the corresponding one in the men's baths. It is to be especially noticed that the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> in the women's baths had no brazier, but had a hanging or suspended floor.</p>
 <p>After having gone through the regular course of perspiration, the Romans made use of instruments called <seg lang="la">strigiles</seg> to scrape off the perspiration, much in the same way as we are accustomed to scrape the sweat off a horse with a piece of iron hoop, after he has run a heat, or comes in from violent exercise. The strigil was also used by the <cb /> Greeks, who called it <foreign lang="greek">στλεγγίς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ξύστρα</foreign>. These instruments, many of which have been discovered among the ruins of the various baths of antiquity, were made of bone, bronze, iron, and silver; all corresponding in form with the epithet of Martial, “<seg lang="la">curvo distringere ferro</seg>” (xiv. 51). The poorer classes were obliged to scrape themselves, but the more wealthy took their slaves to the baths for the purpose—a fact which is elucidated by a curious story related by Spartianus ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 17" default="NO"> <title>Hadr.</title>17</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The strigil was by no means a blunt instrument, consequently its edge was softened by the application of oil that was dropped upon it from a small vessel called <seg lang="la">guttus</seg>, which had a narrow neck, so as to discharge its contents drop by drop, from whence the name is taken. A representation of a <seg lang="la">guttus</seg> is given on the following page. Augustus is related to have suffered from an over-violent use of the strigil ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>80</bibl>). Invalids and persons of a delicate habit made use of sponges, which Pliny says answered for towels as well as strigils, They were finally dried with towels (<seg lang="la">lintea</seg>) and anointed ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 262" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 262</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 31.  125" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxi. 125</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>The common people were supplied with these necessaries in the baths—<seg lang="la">omnia commoda praestantur</seg> <figure id="fig.00193.2">

 —as we saw above; but the more wealthy carried their own with them ( <bibl n="Pers.  5. 126" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.v. 126</bibl>).</p>
 <p>After the operation of scraping and rubbing dry, they retired into, or remained in, the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> <figure id="fig.00194">

</figure> until they thought it prudent to encounter the open air. But it does not appear to have been customary to bathe in the water, when there was any, either of the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> or the <seg lang="la">frigidarium;</seg> the temperature only of the atmosphere in these two chambers being of consequence to break the sudden change from the extreme of heat to cold.</p>
 <p>Notwithstanding the ample account which has been given of the plans and usages respecting baths in general, something yet remains to be said about that particular class known as <seg lang="la">thermae</seg>, of which establishments the baths, in fact, constituted the smallest part. The thermae, properly speaking, were a Roman adaptation of the Greek gymnasium, or <seg lang="la">palaestra</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspalaestra">Palaestra</ref>), as described by Vitruvius; both of which contained a system of baths in conjunction with conveniences for athletic games and youthful sports, <seg lang="la">exedrae</seg> in which the rhetoricians declaimed, poets recited, and philosophers lectured, as well as porticoes and vestibules for the idle, and libraries for the learned. They were decorated with the finest objects of art, both in painting and sculpture, covered with precious marbles, and adorned with fountains and shaded walks and plantations, like the groves of the Academy, and served at Rome all the purposes of a modern club. It may be said that they began <figure id="fig.00194.2">
<head orig="Chief Hall of the Thermae of Caracalla. (Restoration by Reber.)">Chief Hall of the Thermae of Caracalla. (Restoration by Reber.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> and ended with the Empire, for it was not until the time of Augustus that these magnificent structures were commenced. M. Agrippa is the first who afforded these luxuries to his countrymen by bequeathing to them the thermae and gardens which he had erected in the Campus Martius. The <ref type="cross" target="crosspantheon">Pantheon</ref> (q.v.), now existing at Rome, served originally as a vestibule to these baths; and, as it was considered too magnificent for the purpose, it is supposed that Agrippa added the portico and consecrated it as a temple, for which use it still serves. It appears from a passage in Sidonius Apollinaris that the whole of these buildings, together with the adjacent Thermae Neronianae, remained entire in the year A.D. 466. Little is now left beyond a few fragments of ruins and the Pantheon. The example set by Agrippa was followed by Nero, and afterwards by Titus, the ruins of whose thermae are still visible, covering a vast extent, partly underground and partly above the Esquiline Hill. Thermae were also erected by Trajan, Caracalla, and Diocletian, of the last two of which ample remains still exist; and even as late as Constantine, besides several which were constructed by private individuals, P. Victor enumerates sixteen.</p>
 <p>Previously to the erection of these establishments for the use of the population, it was customary for those who sought the favour of the people to give them a day's bathing free of expense. Thus, according to Dio Cassius, Faustus, the son of Sulla , furnished warm baths and oil gratis to the people for one day; and Augustus, on one occasion, furnished warm baths and barbers to the people for the same period gratuitously, and at another time for a whole year to the women as well as the men. From thence it is fair to infer that the <seg lang="la">quadrans</seg> paid for admission into the <seg lang="la">balneae</seg> was not exacted at the thermae, which, as being the works of the emperors, would naturally be opened with imperial generosity to all, and without any charge, otherwise the whole city would have thronged to the establishment bequeathed to them by Agrippa; and in confirmation of this opinion it may be remarked that the old establishments, which were probably erected by private enterprise, were termed <seg lang="la">meritoriae.</seg> Most, if not all, of the other regulations previously detailed 
<pb n="195" /><cb />
 as relating to the economy of the baths apply equally to the <seg lang="la">thermae;</seg> but it is to these establishments especially that the dissolute conduct of the emperors, and other luxurious indulgences of the people in general, detailed in the compositions of the satirists and later writers, must be considered to refer.</p>
 <p>The student is cautioned against an illustration found in all the older dictionaries. It is styled a “Representation of a Roman Bath,” and is said to be from the Thermae of Titus at Rome. It is, in fact, a drawing made in 1553 by Giovanni Antonio Rasconi, an Italian architect, to illustrate a treatise by Johannes Antonius Siccus Cremensis, and was drawn after the description of the baths in Vitruvins. In that treatise it is styled simply “Figura Antiqui Balinei,” but it was put forth by one P. A. Maffei in 1704 as a picture of the “Baths of Titus.” Thence it got into many other works, and received, unfortunately, a general acceptance, though containing several important errors.

</figure> <foreign lang="greek">μύσταξ</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πάππος</foreign> combined; <foreign lang="greek">γένειον</foreign> to the beard proper, the hair on the chin. There is no special word for the whiskers.</p>
 <p>The Greeks regarded the beard as a badge of virility which it was a disgrace to be without; and in the Homeric time it had even a sanctity as among the Jews, so that a common form of entreaty was to touch the beard of the person addressed. It was only shaven as a sign of mourning, though in this case it was instead often left untrimmed. A smooth face was regarded as a sign of effeminacy (Athen. xiii. 565 a). The Spartans punished cowards by shaving off a portion of their beards. From the earliest times, however, the shaving of the upper lip was not uncommon.</p>
 <p>In the time of Alexander the Great the custom of smooth shaving was introduced (Chrysippus <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Athen. xiii. 565 a), and spread from the Macedonians, whose kings are represented on coins, etc., <figure id="fig.00196.2">
<head orig="Coin of Alexander the Great.">Coin of Alexander the Great.</head>
</figure> with smooth faces, throughout the whole Greek world. Laws were passed against it, without effect, at Rhodes and Byzantium; and even Aristotle, we are told, conformed to the new custom ( <bibl n="Diog.  5. 1" default="NO">Diog. Laert.v. 1</bibl>), unlike the other philosophers, who retained the beard as a badge of their profession. A “man with a beard” (<foreign lang="greek">πωγωνοτρόφος</foreign>) after the Macedonian period implies a philosopher (cf. <bibl n="Pers.  4. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iv. 1</bibl>, <seg lang="la">magister barbatus</seg> of Socrates), and we have many allusions to this custom of the later philosophers in such proverbs as “the beard does not make the sage” (<foreign lang="greek">πωγωνοτροφία φιλόσοφον οὐ ποιεῖ</foreign>, <title>De Is. et Osir.</title> 3).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—The Romans in early times wore the beard uncut, as we learn from the insult offered by the Gaul to M. Papirius ( <bibl n="Liv.  5. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.v. 41</bibl>), and from Cicero (<title>Pro Cael.</title> 14); and, according to Varro and Pliny , the Roman beards were not shaven till B.C. 300, when P. Ticinius Menas brought over a barber from Sicily; and Pliny adds that the first Roman who was shaved (<seg lang="la">rasus</seg>) every day was Scipio Africanus. (Cf. Gell. iii. 4.) His custom, however, was soon followed, and shaving became a regular thing. The lower orders, then as now, were not always able to do the same, and hence the jeers of Martial (vii. 95; xii. 59). In the later times of the Republic <cb /> there were many <seg lang="la">iuvenes</seg> who shaved the beard only partially, and trimmed it, so as to give it an ornamental form; to them the terms <seg lang="la">bene barbati</seg> and <seg lang="la">barbatuli</seg> are applied. We hear of young men oiling their chins to force a premature growth of beard ( <bibl n="Petron.  75" default="NO">Petron.75</bibl><bibl n="Petron.  10" default="NO">Petron., 10</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In a general way, in Rome at this time, a long beard (<seg lang="la">barba promissa</seg>) was considered a mark of slovenliness and squalor. The censors L. Veturius and P. Licinius compelled M. Livius, who had been banished, on his restoration to the city to be shaved, and to lay aside his dirty appearance, and then, but not till then, to come into the Senate ( <bibl n="Liv.  27. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxvii. 34</bibl>). The first time of shaving was regarded as the beginning of manhood, and the day on which this took place was celebrated as a festival ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 186" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 186</bibl>). There was no particular time fixed for this to be done. Usually, however, it was when the young Roman assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis.</seg> Augustus did it in his twenty<figure id="fig.00196.3">

 <p>With the emperor Hadrian the beard began to revive. Plutarch says that this emperor wore it to hide some scars on his face. The practice afterwards became common, and till the time of Constantine the Great the emperors appear in busts and coins with beards; but Constantine and his <figure id="fig.00196.4">
<head orig="Pertinax.">Pertinax.</head>
</figure> successors to the end of the sixth century, with the exception of Julian , are represented as beardless. The contrast between the custom of the early emperors and those of Hadrian and his successors as to the beard is seen in the accompanying heads. The Romans, unlike the Greeks, let their beards grow in time of mourning; so did Augustus for the death of Iulius Caesar, and the time when he had it shaved off he made a season of festivity (Dio Cass. xlviii. 34). Other occasions of mourning on which the beard was allowed to grow were, appearance as a <seg lang="la">reus</seg>, condemnation, or some public calamity.

 <p> <foreign lang="greek">Βάρβαροι</foreign> was originally the Greek epithet for a people speaking any language but Greek.

It was not until after the Persian Wars that the name began to carry with it associations of hatred and contempt, and to imply vulgarity and want of cultivation. The national feeling of the Greeks had then risen to such intensity that they deemed themselves above all other peoples in gifts and culture, and looked down upon them with a sense of superiority.

She was secretly put to death by Cassander, along with her son, when the latter had reached his fourteenth year (Justin, xv. 2). According, however, to Diodorus Siculus (xx. 28), he was slain by Polysperchon, who had agreed with Cassander that he would commit the deed. Plutarch says that Polysperchon promised to slay him for 100 talents. We have followed Arrian (vii. 1) in making Barsiné the daughter of Darius. According to Plutarch (<title>Vit. Alex.</title>) she was the daughter of Artabazus; while another authority makes her father to have been named Pharnabazus. It is therefore said by some that two women of the same name are referred to—one a Greek and one a Persian, and both married to Alexander.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ βασιλικά</foreign>). The Greek code of Roman law, commenced about A.D. 876 by the emperor Basil I., and finished by his son, Leo the Philosopher, who reigned A.D. 886-911. It comprised the Institutes, Pandects, Code, the Novellae, and the imperial Constitutions subsequent to the time of Justinian. It is in sixty books, subdivided into titles. The publication of this authorized body of law in Greek led to the gradual disuse of the original compilations of Justinian in the East; but by its means the Roman law was so firmly established in Eastern Europe and Western Asia as to maintain its hold there among the Greek populations to the present day.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">στοὰ βασιλική</foreign>; the pure Latin word being <seg lang="la">regia</seg>, sc. <seg lang="la">aula</seg>). A state building, used by the Romans as a hall of justice and a public meeting-place. The earliest basilica built at Rome was called the <title>Basilica Porcia</title>, after the famous M. Porcius CensoriusCato , who built it in B.C. 184, probably on the model of the <foreign lang="greek">στοὰ βασίλειος</foreign> (“royal colonnade”) at Athens. It stood in the Forum near the Curia. The later basilicas usually bore the name of the persons who built them. Buildings of the same kind were constantly erected in the 
<pb n="198" /><cb />
 provinces to serve as halls of exchange or courts of justice. The form of the basilica was oblong; the interior was a hall, either without any divisions or divided by rows of pillars, with a main nave, and two, or sometimes four, side-aisles. Galleries for spectators were often added above. If the basilica was used as a hall of justice, a space (usually in the form of a large semicircular niche, and containing a tribunal) was set up at the end of the nave for the accommodation of the court. <figure id="fig.00198">

</figure> After the time of Constantine the Great, of whose great basilica, with its nave and two aisles, magnificent ruins still remain, many basilicas were turned into Christian churches, and many churches were built upon the same plan.</p>
 <p>Besides the <title>Basilica Porcia</title> already mentioned <figure id="fig.00198.2">
<head orig="The Basilica at Trèves.">The Basilica at Treves.</head>
</figure> as having been the earliest Roman structure of the kind, there were at Rome fully twenty others erected at different periods, of which <cb /> the following are most frequently mentioned by ancient authors: (1) <title>Basilica Sempronia</title>, constructed by Titus Sempronius, B.C. 171, and supposed to have been between the Vicus Tuscus and the Velabrum.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Basilica Opimia</title>, which was above the Comitium.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Basilica Pauli Aemilii</title>, or <title>Basilica Aemilia</title>, called also <title>Regia Pauli</title> by Statius. Cicero mentions two basilicas of this name, of which one was built, and the other only restored, by Paulus Aemilius. Both these edifices were in the Forum, and one was celebrated for its open peristyle of Phrygian columns, which Plutarch ( <title>Vit. Caes.</title>) states was erected by L. Aemilius Paulus during his consulship, at an expense of 1500 talents, sent to him by Caesar from Gaul, as a bribe to gain him over from the aristocratical party.</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Basilica Pompeii</title>, called also <seg lang="la">regia</seg>, near the theatre of Pompey.</p>
 <p>(5) <title>Basilica Iulia</title>, erected by Iulius Caesar, in the Forum, and opposite to the Basilica Aemilia. It was from the roof of this building that Caligula scattered money among the people for several successive days.</p>
 <p>(6) <title>Basilica Flavia</title>, of the form on which the Christian churches were modelled.</p>
 <p>(7) <title>Basilica Ulpia</title> or <title>Traiani</title>, in the Forum of Trajan.</p>
 <p>(8) <title>Basilica Constantini</title>, erected by the emperor Constantine, supposed to be the ruin now remaining on the Via Sacra, near the Temple of Rome and Venus, and commonly called the Temple of Peace. Of all these magnificent edifices nothing now remains beyond the ground plan, and the bases and some portion of the columns and superstructure of several. The basilica at Pompeii is in better preservation; the external walls, ranges of columns, and tribunal of the judges being still tolerably perfect on the ground floor. See the illustration on page 199.</p>
 <p>The Forum, or, where there was more than one, the one which was in the most frequented and central part of the city, was always selected for the site of a basilica; and hence it is that the classic writers not infrequently use the terms <seg lang="la">forum</seg> and <seg lang="la">basilica</seg> synonymously.

 <p> An old German nation, which inhabited a part of the present Holland, especially the island called Batavorum Insula (modern <title>Betuwe</title>), formed by that branch of the Rhine which empties into the sea near Lugdunum Batavorum (Leyden), together with the Vahalis (Waal) and Mosa (Maas). Their territories, however, extended much beyond the Waal. Tacitus commends their bravery. According to him they were originally the same as the <ref type="cross" target="crosscatti">Catti</ref> (q.v.), a German tribe, which had emigrated from their country on account of domestic troubles. This must have happened before the time of Caesar. When Germanicus was about to invade <cb /> Germany from the sea he made their island the rendezvous of his fleet. Being subjugated by the Romans, they served them with such courage and fidelity as to obtain the title of friends and brethren. They were exempted from tributes and taxes, and permitted to choose their leaders among themselves. Their cavalry was particularly excellent. During the reign of Vespasian they revolted, under the command of Civilis, from the Romans, and extorted from them favourable terms of peace. Trajan and Hadrian subjugated them again. At the end of the third century the Salian Franks obtained possession of the Insula Batavorum. The capital of the nation was Lugdunum Batavorum, now Leyden ( <bibl n="Sal.

 <p>A well-known writer on classical subjects, born at Dresden in 1796. Entering the University of Leipzig in 1816, he studied at first theology, and subsequently classical philology. In 1840, he travelled and studied in Italy, returning in 1842 to take the professorship of archaeology at Leipzig, where his lectures were very largely attended. His lively imagination, prompted by his minute knowledge of antiquity, led him to write his two famous works, which have so successfully reproduced pictures of the ancient society of Greece and Rome, while giving in detail a vast amount of archaeological information. These works are <bibl default="NO"><title>Gallus</title> (Leipzig, 1838)</bibl>, a quasi-narrative of life at Rome under Augustus; and <bibl default="NO"><title>Charikles</title> (Leipzig, 1840)</bibl>, a story of society in ancient Greece. These two works have been revised, re-edited, and translated by numerous scholars, and have been a storehouse of information to students in all lands. His formal treatise, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Comicis Romanorum Fabulis</title> (Leipzig, 1837)</bibl>, is another valuable production, as is also his hand-book of Roman antiquities, carried on after his death by Marquardt.

<head orig="Belisarius">Belisarius</head>

 <p> (Slavonic <title>Beli-Tsar</title>, “White Prince”). One of the greatest generals of his time, to whom the emperor Justinian chiefly owed the splendour of his reign. Sprung from an obscure family in Thrace, Belisarius first served in the body-guard of the emperor, but soon obtained the chief command of an army of 25,000 men, stationed on the Persian frontiers, and in A.D. 530 gained a complete victory over a Persian army not less than 40,000 strong. The next year, however, he lost a battle against the same enemy, who had forced their way into Syria—the only battle which he lost during his whole career. He was recalled from the army, and soon became, at home, the support of his master. In the year 532, civil commotions, proceeding from the rival factions of the circus, who called themselves the Green (<title>Prasini</title>) and the Blue (<title>Veneti</title>), and who caused great disorders in Constantinople, brought the life and reign of Justinian in the utmost peril; and Hypatius was already chosen emperor, when Belisarius, with a small body of faithful adherents, restored order. Justinian, with a view of conquering the dominions of Gelimer, king of the Vandals, sent Belisarius, with an army of 15,000 men, to Africa. After two victories, he secured the person and the treasures of the Vandal king. Gelimer was led in triumph through the streets of Constantinople, and Justinian ordered a medal to be struck, with the inscription <title>Belisarius Gloria Romanorum</title>, which has descended to our times. By the dissensions existing in the royal family of the Ostrogoths in Italy, Justinian was induced to attempt the reduction of Italy and Rome under his sceptre. Belisarius vanquished Vitiges, king of the Goths, made him prisoner at Ravenna (A.D. 540), and conducted him, together with many other Goths, to Constantinople. The war in Italy against the Goths continued; but Belisarius, not being sufficiently supplied with money and troops by the emperor, demanded his recall (A.D. 548). He afterwards commanded in the war against the Bulgarians, whom he conquered in the year 559. Upon his return to Constantinople he was accused of having taken part in a conspiracy; but Justinian was convinced of his innocence, and is said to have restored to him his property and dignities, of which he had been deprived. Belisarius died A.D. 565. His history has been much coloured by the poets, and particularly by Marmontel, in his politico-philosophical romance. According to his narrative, the emperor caused the eyes of the hero to be struck out, and Belisarius was compelled to beg his bread in the streets of Constantinople. Other writers say that Justinian had him thrown <cb /> into a prison, which is still shown under the appellation of the Tower of Belisarius. From this tower he is reported to have let down a bag fastened to a rope, and to have addressed the passers by in these oft-quoted words: “Give an obolus to Belisarius (<title>Date obolum Belisario</title>), whom virtue exalted, and envy has oppressed.” Of this, however, no contemporary writer makes any mention. <ref type="cross" target="crosstzetzes">Tzetzes</ref> (q.v.), a writer of the twelfth century, was the first who related this fable. Through too great indulgence towards his wife Antonia, Belisarius was impelled to many acts of injustice, and he evinced a servile submissiveness to the licentious Theodora, the wife of Justinian.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βελλεροφῶν</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Bellerophontes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Βελλεροφόντης</foreign>). Son of Glaucus of Corinth (or, according to another account, of Poseidon), and grandson of Sisyphus. His proper name is said to have been Hipponoüs; the name Bellerophontes implies that he was the slayer of some now unknown monster. In later times his name was wrongly explained as the slayer of a certain Corinthian, Bellerus, on account of which he was supposed to have fled to Proetus at Tiryns or Corinth. The wife of Proetus, Anteia (or Stheneboea), fell in love with the beautiful youth; he was deaf to her entreaties; she slandered him to her husband, who resolved on his destruction. He sent Bellerophon to Lycia, to his father-in-law Iobates, with a tablet in cipher, begging him to put the bearer to death. Iobates first commissioned Bellerophon to destroy the fire-breathing monster Chimaera, a task which he executed with the help of his winged horse Pegasus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspegasus">Pegasus</ref>.) Thereupon, after a fierce battle, he conquered the <figure id="fig.00202">

  by Zeus. Afterwards Bellerophon was hated by all the gods, and wandered about alone, devouring his heart in sorrow. His son Isander was killed by Ares in battle against the Solymi, while Laodamia was sacrificed to the wrath of Artemis. This is the Homeric version; but, according to Pindar, Bellerophon's high fortune made him so overweening that he wished to mount to heaven on Pegasus. Zeus, however, drove the horse wild with a gadfly, and Bellerophon fell and came to a miserable end. He was honoured as a hero in Corinth, an enclosure being consecrated to him in the cypress grove of Craneion. See Morris, <title>Bellerophon in Argos</title>, etc.

<head orig="Bellōna">Bellona</head>

 <p> (1) The Roman goddess of war, in early Latin called Duellona. An old Italian divinity, probably of Sabine origin. She was supposed to be the wife or sister of Mars, and was identified with the Greek Enyo (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐνυώ</foreign>). Her temple, which was situated in the Campus Martius, outside the old Pomerium, was used for meetings of the Senate when it was dealing with the ambassadors of foreign nations, or Roman generals who claimed a triumph on their return from war, for it must be remembered that under such circumstances a general might not enter the city. The pillar of war (Columna Bellica) stood hard by. It was from this, as representing the boundary of the enemy's territory, that the Fetialis threw his lance on declaring war. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfetiales">Fetiales</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Quite a different goddess is the Bellona whom the Roman government brought from Comana in Cappadocia towards the beginning of the first century B.C., during the Mithridatic War. This Bellona was worshipped in a different locality, and with a service conducted by Cappadocian priests and priestesses. These Bellonarii moved through the city in procession at the festivals of the goddess, in black raiment, and shed their own blood at the sacrifice, wounding themselves for the purpose in the arms and loins with a two-edged axe, and prophesying amid a wild noise of drums and trumpets.

<div2 id="crossbeneficium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Beneficium, Beneficiarius">Beneficium, Beneficiarius</head>

 <p> The word <seg lang="la">beneficium</seg> is of frequent occurrence in the Roman law, in the sense of some special privilege or favour granted by the praetor or the emperor to a class of persons on some special ground of equity; but the word was also used in other senses. In the time of Cicero it was usual for a general, or a governor of a province, to report to the treasury (<seg lang="la">aerarium</seg>) the names of those under his command who had done good service to the State; those whose names were entered in such report were said <seg lang="la">in beneficiis ad aerarium deferri</seg> ( <title>Pro. Arch.</title> 5; <title>Ad Fam.</title> v. 20; and the note of Manutius). It was required by a Lex Iulia that the names should be given in within thirty days after the accounts of the general or governor. <title>In beneficiis</title> in these passages may mean that the persons so reported were considered as persons who had deserved well of the State, and so the word <seg lang="la">beneficium</seg> may have reference to the services of the individuals; but as the object for which their services were reported was the benefit of the individuals, it seems that the term had reference to the gratuity in the form of money or presents given for such services. The honours and offices of the Roman State in the republican period were called the <seg lang="la">beneficia</seg> of the Roman people.</p>
 <p>Beneficium also signified any promotion conferred on or grant made to soldiers, who were thence called <seg lang="la">beneficiarii;</seg> this term was a common one, as we see from inscriptions in Gruter (li. 4; cxxx. 5), in some of which the word <seg lang="la">beneficiarius</seg> is represented by the two letters <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. f</hi>. Beneficiarius is also used by Caesar (<title>De Bell. Civ.</title> i. 75) to express 
<pb n="204" /><cb />
 the person who had received a beneficium. It does not, however, appear from these passages what the beneficium actually was. It might be any kind of honour, or special exemption from service ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>12</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Grants of land and other things made by the Roman emperors were called <seg lang="la">beneficia</seg>, and were entered in a book called Liber Beneficiorum. The secretary or clerk who kept this book was called <seg lang="la">a commentariis beneficiorum</seg>, as appears from an inscription in Gruter (clxxviii. 1).</p>
 <p>It was the practice of the kings and leaders of the tribes which took possession of the western provinces of the Roman Empire to grant lands to their nobles to be held generally for life on condition of special personal service. Lands so granted were called <seg lang="la">beneficia.</seg> From about the end of the ninth century, when <seg lang="la">beneficia</seg> became hereditary, they were also called <hi rend="italic">feoda</hi> or feuds, the two words being used indifferently to denote the same condition of landed property (Guizot, <title>Histoire de la Civilisation en France</title>, iii. p. 247). The beneficiarius is he who has a beneficium. Grants made for the purpose of endowing churches were called <seg lang="la">beneficia;</seg> hence the word “benefice” came to be applied to an ecclesiastical preferment.

It remained in the possession of the Romans during the whole of the Second Punic War, and obtained the thanks of the Senate for its firm attachment to the Republic at that critical period (<bibl n="Liv.  27. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxvii. 10</bibl>). We subsequently hear of its being a second time colonized by the veteran soldiers of Augustus, and also a third time under Nero. Beneventum was situated near the junction of the Sabatus and Calor, now Sabbato and Calore. Its position was a very important one, since here the main roads intersected each other from Latium into southern Italy, and from Samnium into Campania. Under the Lombards, Beneventum became the capital of a powerful dukedom. It abounds in remains of ancient sculpture above any other town in Italy. The most beautiful relic of former days at this place is the Arch of Trajan, which forms one of the entrances into the city. Near Beneventum, Pyrrhus was defeated by Dentatus, B.C. 274. <cb />

 <p>In 1862, Dr. Benfey was made Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at the University of Göttingen, a chair which he continued to fill until his death in 1881. He left unfinished a Vedic grammar, for which he had collected a large mass of material. His only work in classical literature was his earliest publication—a translation of Terence <bibl default="NO">(Stuttgart, 1837)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>No scholar did more than Benfey to enlarge the range of the study of Sanskrit, a work to which he brought the zeal of an enthusiast. As a comparative philologist he was in some respects a follower of Franz <ref type="cross" target="crossbopp">Bopp</ref> (q.v.), from whom, however, he deviated in deriving all IndoEuropean words from monosyllabic primitive verbs, a conception which depends upon his theory of the origin of stem suffixes. These he regarded as nearly all derived from a fundamental radical √ <hi rend="SmallCaps">ant</hi> appearing in the present participle of verbs. In his defence of this singular thesis he is obliged to assume permutations of sound that violate the most elementary laws of the science of phonology. His view is to be found set forth both in his <title>Lexicon of Greek Roots</title>, in his Sanskrit grammar, and in numerous essays.

 <head><surname full="yes">Bentley</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Richard</foreName>
 <p>, perhaps the greatest among the classical scholars of England, was born at Oulton in Yorkshire, January 27th, 1662. After spending five years at the Wakefield Grammar School, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1676, taking the Bachelor's degree in 1679. No record has been kept of his career as an undergraduate, though he is known to have given evidence of a strong taste for classical study. In 
<pb n="205" /><cb /> 1682, his college gave him the appointment of headmaster to the Spalding Grammar School in Lincolnshire, an office which he shortly resigned to become tutor to the son of Dr. Stillingfleet, afterwards Bishop of Worcester. In 1689, he went to Oxford with his pupil, and gained such reputation by his erudition as to be twice appointed to deliver the Boyle Lectures on the “Evidences of Religion.” In 1690 he took orders, and received from Bishop Stillingfleet various preferments, with the office of librarian to the Royal Library at St. James's. In 1700, he became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1717, Regius Professor of Divinity. His arrogance, greed, and violence in his relations with his colleagues of the university made his subsequent career one of continual strife and controversy. In 1718, the University Senate voted to deprive him of his degrees; in 1734, his deposition as Master was pronounced; yet his ability and force of character were such that at the time of his death he still retained his offices as well as his degrees. He died July 14th, 1742.</p>
 <p>As a philologist, Bentley may be truly said to have established the principles of historical criticism and opened a new era for classical scholarship, so that in Germany to-day his name is held in the highest honour as the greatest of England's philologists. His <bibl default="NO"><title>Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris</title> (1699)</bibl> gave him an immediate reputation all over Europe. These <title>Epistles</title> purported to be the production of <ref type="cross" target="crossphalaris">Phalaris</ref> (q.v.), and to date back to the sixth century B.C. This claim Bentley, in a paper published for Wotton, showed to be false, whereupon the Christchurch (Oxford) editor of the <title>Epistles</title>, the Hon. Charles Boyle (afterward Earl of Orrery) attacked Bentley in a dissertation which Dyce has characterized as “a tissue of superficial learning, dexterous malice, and happy raillery.” To this Bentley, superior alike in scholarship and wit, made his immortal reply, to which no answer was ever given, and which is a marvellously brilliant effort, unique in being at once imposing in its learning and fascinating in its ingenious use of all the arts of controversy. The best edition is Wagner's <bibl default="NO">(1874)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Other important works of Bentley are his <title>Letter to Mill</title>, on the chronicler John Malelas <bibl default="NO">(1691)</bibl>; an edition of Horace <bibl default="NO">(1711)</bibl>—an epoch-making masterpiece, recently edited by Zangemeister <bibl default="NO">(1869)</bibl>; an edition of Terence <bibl default="NO">(1726)</bibl>; and an edition of <bibl default="NO"><title>Paradise Lost</title> (1732)</bibl>, carried out on the same plan, and much less happily executed. A very remarkable proposal of Bentley's—remarkable considering the time at which it was put forth—was his plan, published in 1720, of printing an edition of the New Testament in which the received Greek text should be corrected by a careful comparison of the oldest existing Greek MSS., and with the Vulgate. This proposal, which was received with a storm of opposition, was not carried out; but the principles laid down by Bentley have been adopted, and have produced important results in the hands of Lachmann and other textual critics of later times.

<div2 id="crossberenice" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Berenīcé">Berenice</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βερενίκη</foreign>). A name common to several women of antiquity. It is of Greek origin, and means “victory-bringing” or “bearer of victory,” the initial B being written, according to Macedonian usage, for the letter <foreign lang="greek">Φ</foreign>, or, in other words, <foreign lang="greek">Βερενίκη</foreign> being put for <foreign lang="greek">Φερενίκη</foreign>, just as the Macedonians said <foreign lang="greek">Βίλιππος</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">Φίλιππος</foreign>. The most remarkable of this name were the following: (1) The granddaughter of Cassander, brother of Antipater. She married Philip, a Macedonian, probably one of the officers of Alexander, and became by him the mother of many children, among whom were Magas, king of Cyrené, and Antigoné, whom she married to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. She followed into Egypt Eurydicé, daughter of Antipater, who returned to that country to rejoin her husband, Ptolemy I. Berenicé inspired this prince with so strong a passion that he put away Eurydicé, although he had children by her, and married the former. He also gave the preference, in the succession to the throne, to her son Ptolemy, notwithstanding the better claims of his offspring by Eurydicé. Berenicé was remarkable for her beauty, and her portrait often appears on the medals of Ptolemy I. along with that of the latter.</p>
 <p>(2) Daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoé. She followed her mother into exile, and retired with her to the court of Magas, at Cyrené, who married Arsinoé and adopted Berenicé. This will serve to explain why Polybius and Justin make Berenicé to have been the daughter of Magas, while Callimachus gives Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoé as her parents. After the death of Magas, Arsinoé engaged her daughter in marriage to Demetrius, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes; but, on the young prince's having come from Macedonia to Cyrené, she became attached to him herself. Demetrius, conducting himself insolently, was slain in a conspiracy, at the head of which was Berenicé. The latter thereupon married her brother Ptolemy (Euergetes) III. A short time after the nuptials Ptolemy was obliged to go on an expedition into Syria, and Berenicé made a vow that she would consecrate her beautiful head of hair to Aphrodité if her husband returned safe to Egypt. Upon his return she fulfilled her vow in the temple of Aphrodité Zephyrites. On the following day, however, the hair was not to be found. As both the monarch and his queen were greatly disquieted at the loss, Conon the Samaritan, an eminent astronomer of the day, in order to conciliate the royal favour, declared that the locks of Berenicé had been removed by divine interposition, and translated to the skies in the form of a constellation. Hence the cluster of stars near the tail of the Lion is called <title>Coma Berenices</title> (Berenicé's hair). Callimachus wrote a piece on this subject, now lost, but a translation of which into Latin verse by Catullus has reached our time (<bibl n="Catul. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. <title>Carm.</title> lxvi</bibl>). Berenicé was put to death B.C. 216, by the order of Ptolemy Philopator, her son.</p>
 <p>(3) A daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, given by him in marriage to Antiochus Theos, king of Syria, in order to cement a peace between the two 
<pb n="206" /><cb />
 countries. After the death of her father Antiochus put her aside, and recalled his former wife Laodicé. This last, having taken off Antiochus by poison, sought to destroy Berenicé also as well as her son. This son was surprised and carried off by an emissary of Laodicé's, and shortly after put to death; and Berenicé, in searching for him, was entrapped and slain, B.C. 246.</p>
 <p>(4) Called by some authors Cleopatra , was the only legitimate child of Ptolemy Lathyrus, and ascended the throne after the death of her father, B.C. 81. Sulla , who was at that time dictator, compelled her to marry, and share her throne with, her cousin, who took the name of Ptolemy Alexander. She was poisoned by the latter only nineteen days after the marriage.</p>
 <p>(5) Daughter of Ptolemy Auletes. The people of Alexandria having revolted against this prince in B.C. 58, drove him out, and placed upon the throne his two daughters, Tryphena and Berenicé. The former died soon after, and Berenicé was given in marriage to Seleucus, surnamed Cybiosactes. His personal deformity, however, and vicious character soon rendered him so odious to the queen that she caused him to be strangled. Berenicé then married Archelaüs; but Ptolemy Auletes having been restored by Gabinius, the Roman commander, she was put to death by her own father, B.C. 55.</p>
 <p>(6) A native of Chios, and one of the wives of Mithridates of Pontus. On the overthrow of this monarch's power by Lucullus, Berenicé, in obedience to an order from her husband, took poison along with his other wives, but this not proving effectual, she was strangled by the eunuch Bacchus, B.C. 71.</p>
 <p>(7) Daughter of Agrippa I., king of Iudaea, and born A.D. 28. She was at first affianced to Marcus, son of Alexander, but this young man having died, Agrippa gave her in marriage to his brother Herod, king of Chalcis, by whom she became the mother of two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. Having lost her husband when she was at the age of twenty, she went to live with her brother Agrippa, a circumstance which gave rise to reports injurious to her character. To put an end to these rumours, she made proposals to Polemo, king of Cilicia, and offered to become his wife if he would embrace Judaism. Polemo consented, but she soon left him, and returned, in all probability, to her brother, for she was with the latter when St. Paul was arrested at Jerusalem, A.D. 63. The commerce between the guilty pair became now so public that the rumour even reached Rome, and we find Juvenal alluding to the affair in one of his satires (vi. 155). She followed Agrippa when he went to join Vespasian, whom Nero had charged to reduce the Jews to obedience. A new scene now opened for her; she won the affections of Titus, and, at a subsequent period, when Vespasian was established on the throne, and Titus returned home after terminating the Jewish War, she accompanied him to Rome along with her brother Agrippa. At Rome she lived openly with Titus, and took up her abode in the imperial palace, as we learn from Dio Cassius, who states also that she was then in the flower of her age. Titus, it is said, intended even to acknowledge her as his wife; but he was compelled by the murmurs of his subjects to abandon this idea, and he sent her away from the city soon after his accession to the throne. Such, at least, is the account given by Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tit. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tit.</title>7</bibl>), who appears more entitled to belief than Dio Cassins, according <cb /> to whom Titus sent Berenicé away before his accession to the throne, and refused to receive her again, when she had returned to Rome a short time after the commencement of his reign. There is a great difficulty attending the history of this Berenicé as regards her intimacy with Titus. She must, at least, have been forty-two years of age when she first became acquainted with the Roman prince, and fifty-one years old at the period of the celebrated scene which forms the subject of Racine's tragedy. Many are inclined to believe, therefore, that the Berenicé to whom Titus was attached was the daughter of Mariamné and Archelaüs, and, consequently, the niece of the Berenicé of whom we have been speaking, she would be twenty-five years old when Titus came into Iudaea. The story of Berenicé forms the subject of a play by Racine, <title>Bérénice.</title>

 <p> (1) A city of Egypt on the coast of the Sinus Arabicus, from which a road was made across the intervening desert to Coptos on the Nile, by Ptolemy Philadelphus, 258 miles in length. From this harbour the vessels of Egypt took their departure for Arabia Felix and India. It was through the medium of Berenicé also, and the caravan route to Coptos, that the principal trade of the Romans with India was conducted. By this line of communication it is said that a sum not less than what would now be $2,000,000 was remitted by the Roman traders to their correspondents in the East, in payment of merchandise which ultimately sold for a hundred times as much. The ruins of the ancient Berenicé are found at the modern port of Habest.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βίας</foreign>). (1) The son of Amythaon and Idomené, was king of Argos, and brother to the famous soothsayer <ref type="cross" target="crossmelampus">Melampus</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>(2) One of the Seven Wise Men of Greece. He was son of Teutamus, and was born at Priené, in Ionia, about B.C. 570. Bias was a practical philosopher, studied the laws of his country, and employed his knowledge in the service of his friends, defending them in the courts of justice, settling their disputes. He made a noble use of his wealth. His advice, that the Ionians should fly before the victorious Cyrus to Sardinia, was not followed, and the victory of the army of Cyrus confirmed the correctness of his opinion. The inhabitants of Priené, when besieged by Mazares, resolved to abandon the city with their property. On this occasion Bias replied to one of his fellow-citizens, who expressed astonishment that he made no preparations for his departure, “I carry everything with me.” He remained in his native country, where he died at a very advanced age. His countrymen buried him with splendour, and honoured his memory. Some of his apophthegms are still preserved.

<div2 id="crossbibaculus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Bibacŭlus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">M. Furius</foreName>
 <p>A Latin poet, born at Cremona about B.C. 103. He appears to have composed a turgid poem entitled <title>Aethiopis</title>, on the legend, very probably, of the Aethiopian Memnon; and also another on the mouths of the Rhine. The latter is thought to have formed part of an epic poem on Caesar's wars in Gaul. Both works are lost, and we have only a couple of fragments remaining. Horace ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 40" default="NO"> Sat., 40</bibl>) ridicules a laughable verse of his, in which Iupiter is represented as spitting snow upon the Alps: <title>Iupiter hibernas cana nive conspuet Alpes.</title> This line occurred in the beginning of a poem which he had composed on the Gallic War. Quintilian (x. 1, 96) enumerates Bibaculus among the Roman iambic poets, and in another part of his work (viii. 6, 18) gives this same line, citing it as an instance of harsh metaphor. To render his parody more severe, Horace substitutes Furius himself for the monarch of the skies, and, to prevent all mistake, applies to the former a laughable species of designation, drawn directly from his personal appearance, <seg lang="la">pingui tentus omaso</seg>, “distended with his fat paunch.”

<head orig="Bibliothēca">Bibliotheca</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βιβλιοθήκη</foreign>). A library. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The large libraries of the Assyrian and Egyptian monarchs were unknown to the Greeks till the time of the Ptolemies. We do indeed hear of a library formed by Pisistratus (Aul. Gell. vii. 17), which Aulus Gellius calls “the first public library”; of another by Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos (Athen. i. 3); and among private collectors we hear of Nicocrates of Cyprus, Euclid the Archon, Euripides (Athen. i. 3), Euthydemus ( <title>Memor.</title> iv. 2), and Aristotle (Strabo, xiii. 1). But it was the Macedonian rulers of Alexandria who first created a public library on a large scale. Ptolemy Philadelphus collected books from all parts of Greece and Asia, the larger number of which he deposited in the <ref type="cross" target="crossmuseum">Museum</ref> (q.v.), a building in the Bruchium quarter of Alexandria, and the rest in the Serapeum. Zenodotus was the first librarian, after him Callimachus (who made a catalogue called the <foreign lang="greek">Πίνακες</foreign>), then Eratosthenes, then Apollonius, and then Aristophanes. The number of volumes in the two libraries seems to have been between 500,000 and 600,000. Books in foreign languages were brought to Alexandria and translated for the purpose of being placed in the library, and the Septuagint version of the Old Testament is said to have been made in this way. Galen tells us that the autograph original copies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were procured for the library.</p>
 <p>This priceless collection suffered considerably in the siege of Alexandria by Iulius Caesar, in the destruction of the Bruchium quarter by Aurelian (A.D. 273), and by the edict of Theodosius for the destruction of the Serapeum (A.D. 389). It is said to have been destroyed by the Arabs in A.D. 640 (Gibbon, ch. 51), but this tradition is now largely discredited.</p>
 <p>A rival library to that at Alexandria was started by the kings of Pergamus, but was transported to Egypt by Antony, who made a present of its 200,000 volumes to Cleopatra. By the second or first century B.C. there seem to have been libraries in most Greek towns. (For bibliography, see below.)
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The first public library in Rome was that founded by Asinius Pollio ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>vii. 30</bibl>), and was in the Atrium Libertatis on the Aventine. Iulius Caesar had projected a grand Greek and Latin library, and had commissioned Varro to take measures for the establishment of it; but the scheme was prevented by his death ( <title>Iul.</title> 44). The library of Pollio was followed by that of Augustus in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>29</bibl>), another, the Bibliotheca Octaviana (so called from Augustus's sister Octavia), forming part of the Porticus Octavia. There were also libraries on the Capitol, in the Temple of Peace founded by Vespasian, in the palace of Tiberius, besides the Ulpian Library (so called after its founder, Trajan), which was the most famous ( <bibl n="Gel.  11. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xi. 17</bibl>; Dio Cass. lxviii. 16). This library was attached by Diocletian, as an ornament, to his <seg lang="la">thermae.</seg></p>
 <p>Private collections of books were made at Rome soon after the Second Punic War, sometimes from the spoils of Grecian or Eastern conquest. Thus Aemilius Paulus brought to Rome the library of Perseus, king of Macedonia; Sulla , that of Apellicon of Teos; Lucullus, the extensive one of the kings of Pontus, to which he gave the public free 
<pb n="209" /><cb />
 access. The zeal of Cicero, Atticus, Varro, and others in increasing their libraries is well known. Serenus Sammonicus possessed a library of 62,000 books. Towards the end of the Republic it became, in fact, the fashion to have a room elegantly furnished as a library, and reserved for that purpose. However ignorant or unstudious a person might be, it was fashionable to appear learned by having a library, though he might never even read the titles of the books. Seneca (<title>De Tranq. An.</title> 9) condemns the rage for mere book-collecting, and rallies those who were more pleased with the outside than the inside. Lucian wrote a separate piece to expose this common folly.</p>
 <p>We read of provincial libraries at Milan, Comum, Tibur, and Patrae.</p>
 <p>A library generally had an eastern aspect (Vitruv. vi. 7). In Herculaneum a library, fully furnished, has been discovered. Round the walls, it had cases containing the books in rolls, and a rectangular case occupied the centre of the room: these cases were numbered. It was a very small room—so small that a person by stretching out his arms could touch both sides of it; yet it contained 1700 rolls. The cases were called either <seg lang="la">armaria, loculamenta, foruli</seg>, or <seg lang="la">nidi.</seg> Asinius Pollio had set the fashion in his public library of adorning the room with the portraits and busts of celebrated men, as well as statues of Minerva and the Muses. This example was soon followed in the private libraries of the rich. The <seg lang="la">librarii a bibliotheca</seg> or <seg lang="la">bibliothecarii</seg>, who had charge of the libraries, were usually slaves or freedmen.

 <p> An erection on a spot where lightning had fallen. The name is derived from the sacrifice of a young sheep (<seg lang="la">bidens</seg>) by the <seg lang="la">haruspices</seg> at the place.

When lightning had struck a spot, it was held necessary <seg lang="la">condere fulgur</seg>, either <seg lang="la">publice</seg> or <seg lang="la">privatim</seg>, according to the nature of the place. If a man had been killed by the lightning, it was not lawful to burn the corpse, but he was buried on the spot ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 2.  145" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H.

A <seg lang="la">bidens</seg> was offered, and a small enclosure, neither paved nor covered, was built around the heap, and was further surrounded by an exterior wall, bearing the legend <seg lang="la">fulgur conditum.</seg> Many inscriptions <figure id="fig.00209">

 <p>An archaeologist, born November 24th, 1785, at Karlsruhe. He entered the University of Halle in 1803, and was influenced by the remarkable prelections of F. A. <ref type="cross" target="crosswolf">Wolf</ref> (q.v.) to engage in the study of classical philology, of which he became professor at Heidelberg in 1809, leaving that chair to take the professorship of rhetoric and ancient literature at Berlin, where he lectured for some forty years with extraordinary success. His is one of the greatest names in the history of philology as a science, in that he conceived of it as an organically constituted whole; so that his lectures included grammar (formal and historical), exegesis, archaeology proper, and the study of ancient literature, history, politics, religion, and society. In short, he aimed at an intellectual reproduction of antiquity on all its sides, as essential to a fruitful study of the classics. This view, which excited much opposition for a time, gave an undeniable impetus to profound and accurate scholarship. His great works are an edition of Pindar in 2 vols. (1811- 22); his treatise <title>Die Staathaushaltung der Athener</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1817; third ed., by Frankel, 1886)</bibl>—a monument of subtle analysis, minute research, and vast learning; his <bibl default="NO"><title>Metrologische Untersuchungen über Gewichte, Münzfusse und Masse des Alterthums</title> (1838)</bibl>; his <bibl default="NO"><title>Urkunden über das Seewesen des attischen Staats</title> (1840)</bibl>; the <title>Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum</title>, of which he began the publication at the cost of the Royal Academy of Berlin, and which has been continued by Franz, Kirchhoff, Curtius, Röhl, and others; editions of the <title>Antigone</title> of Sophocles <bibl default="NO">(1843)</bibl>, and of the fragments ascribed to Philolaüs; besides a collection of lectures, essays, etc., with the title <title>Gesammelte kleine Schriften</title>, 7 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1858-74)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossboeotarches" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Boeotarches">Boeotarches</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βοιωτάρχης</foreign>). The Boeotians in ancient times occupied Arné in Thessaly ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 12</bibl>). Sixty years after the taking of Troy they were expelled by the Thessalians, and settled in the country then called Cadmeis, but afterwards Boeotia. The leader of the Boeotians was King Opheltas. It would seem that their kings ruled the whole country from Thebes. Later on, the country was divided into several States, containing each a principal city, with its allies and dependants. The number and names of these independent States are differently given by different writers on the subject; we know, however, for certain that they formed a confederacy called the Boeotian League, with Thebes at its head, and Freeman is of opinion that the political union grew out of an older Amphictyony. Common sanctuaries were the temple of the Itonian Athené near Coronea, where the Pamboeotia were celebrated, and the Temple of Poseidon in Onchestus. Thucydides (iv. 93) mentions seven independent States: Thebes, Haliartus, Coronea, Copae, Thespiae, Tanagra, and Orchomenus; and we learn from inscriptions that, at one time or other, the following belonged to the same class: Anthedon, Lebadea, Hyettus, Acraephia, Chorsia (or Korsia, Demosth. <title>F. L.</title> 141, etc.), Thisbé, Chaeronea. O. Müller (<title>Orchom.</title> p. 403) supposes there were originally fourteen free States. Probably the number differed at different times.</p>
 <p>Each of the principal towns of Boeotia seems to have had its <foreign lang="greek">δῆμος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">βουλή</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">βουλή</foreign> was presided over by an archon, who probably had succeeded to the priestly functions of the old kings, but possessed little, if any, executive authority. The polemarchs, who, in treaties and agreements, are mentioned next to the archon, had some executive authority, but did not command forces—e. g. they could imprison, and they directed the levies of troops. But, besides the archon of each separate State, there was an archon of the confederacy —<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων ἐν κοινῷ Βοιωτῶν</foreign>—most probably always a Theban. His name was affixed to all alliances and compacts which concerned the whole confederacy, and he was president of what Thucydides calls the four councils, who directed the affairs of the league (<foreign lang="greek">ἅπαν τὸ κῦρος ἔχουσι</foreign>). On important questions they seem to have been united; for the same author speaks of them as <foreign lang="greek">ἡ βουλή</foreign>, and informs us that the determinations of the Boeotarchs required the ratification of this body before they were valid. We may now explain who these Boeotarchs were. They were properly the military heads of the confederacy, chosen by the different States; but we also find them discharging the functions of an executive in various matters. In fact, they are represented by Thucydides as forming an alliance with foreign States; as receiving ambassadors on their return home; as negotiating with envoys from other countries, and acting as the representatives of the whole league, though the <foreign lang="greek">βουλή</foreign> refused to sanction the measures they had resolved on in the particular case to which we are now alluding. Another instance in which the Boeotarchs appear as executive is their interference with Agesilaüs, on his embarking from Aulis for Asia (B.C. 396), when they prevented him offering sacrifice as he wished. Still, the principal duty of the Boeotarchs was of a military nature: thus, they led into the field the troops of their respective States; and when at home they took whatever measures were requisite to forward the <cb /> military operations of the league or of their own State. For example, we read of one of the Theban Boeotarchs ordering the Thebans to come in arms to the ecclesia for the purpose of being ready to attack Plataea. Each State of the confederacy elected one Boeotarch, the Thebans two, although on one occasion—i. e. after the return of the exiles with Pelopidas (B.C. 379)—we read of there being three at Thebes. The total number from the whole confederacy varied with the number of the independent States. Mention is made of the Boeotarchs by Thucydides, in connection with the battle of Delium (B.C. 424). There is, however, a difference of opinion with respect to his meaning: some understand him to speak of eleven, some of twelve, and others of thirteen Boeotarchs. Dr. Arnold is disposed to adopt the last number; and we think the context is in favour of the opinion that there were then thirteen Boeotarchs, so that the number of free States was twelve. At the time of the battle of Leuctra (B.C. 371), we find seven Boeotarchs mentioned; on another occasion, when Greece was invaded by the Gauls (B.C. 279), we read of four. Livy states that there were twelve, but before the time (B.C. 171) to which his statement refers Plataea had been reunited to the league. Still the number mentioned in any case is no test of the actual number, inasmuch as we are not sure that all the Boeotarchs were sent out by their respective states on every expedition or to every battle.</p>
 <p>The Boeotarchs, when engaged in military service, formed a council of war, the decisions of which were determined on by a majority of votes, the president being one of the two Theban Boeotarchs who commanded alternately. Their period of service was a year, beginning about the winter solstice; and whoever continued in office longer than his time was punishable with death both at Thebes and in other cities. Epaminondas and Pelopidas did so on their invasion of Laconia (B.C. 369), but their eminent services saved them; in fact, the judges did not even come to a vote respecting the former (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ ἀρχὴν περὶ αὐτοῦ θέσθαι τὴν ψῆφον</foreign>). At the expiration of the year, a Boeotarch was eligible to office a second time, and Pelopidas was repeatedly chosen. From the case of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, who were brought before Theban judges (<foreign lang="greek">δικασταί</foreign>) for transgression of the law which limited the time of office, we may conclude that each Boeotarch was responsible to his own State alone, and not to the general body of the four councils.</p>
 <p>Mention is made by Livy of an election of Boeotarchs. He further informs us that the league (<seg lang="la">concilium</seg>) was broken up by the Romans B.C. 171. Still, it must have been partially revived, as we are told of a second breaking-up by the Romans after the destruction of Corinth, B.C. 146. See <bibl default="NO">Freeman, <title>Hist. of Federal Government</title> (1893)</bibl>, and Ten Breujel, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Foedere Boeotico</title> (Groningen, 1834)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossboeotia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Boeotia">Boeotia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βοιωτία</foreign>). A country of Greece proper, lying to the northwest of Attica, and shut in by the chains of Helicon, Cithaeron, Parnassus, and, towards the sea, Ptoüs; which mountains enclosed a large plain, constituting the chief part of the country. Numerous rivers, of which the Cephissus was the most important, descending from the heights, had probably stagnated for a long time, and formed lakes, of which the Copa ïs was the largest. These same rivers appear to have formed 
<pb n="213" /><cb />
 the soil of Boeotia, which is among the most fruitful in Greece. Boeotia was also perhaps the most thickly settled part of Greece, for no other could show an equal number of important cities. This country, as we learn from the concurrent testimony of Strabo, Pausanias, and other ancient writers, was first occupied by several barbarous claus, under the various names of Aeones, Ectenes, Temmices, and Hyantes. To these succeeded, according to the common account, Cadmus and his followers, who, after expelling some of the indigenous tribes above mentioned, and conciliating others, founded a city, which became afterwards so celebrated under the name of Thebes, and to which he gave the name of Cadmea. The descendants of Cadmus were compelled, subsequently, to evacuate Boeotia, after the capture of Thebes by the Epigoni, and to seek refuge in the country of the Illyrian Encheleës ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 61</bibl>). They regained possession, however, of their former territory, but were once more expelled, as we learn from Strabo, by a numerous horde of Thracians and others. On this occasion, having withdrawn into Thessaly, they united themselves with the people of Arné, a district of that province, and for the first time assumed the name of Boeotians. After a lapse of some years, they were compelled to abandon Thessaly, when they once more succeeded in re-establishing themselves in their original abode, to which they now communicated the name of Boeotia. This event, according to Thucydides, occurred about sixty years after the capture of Troy; but, in order to reconcile this account with the statement of Homer, who distinctly names the Boeotians among the Grecian forces assembled at that memorable siege, the historian admits that a Boeotian division (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποδασμός</foreign>) had already settled in this province prior to the migration of the great body of the nation (i. 12). <figure id="fig.00213">
<head orig="Boeotian Coin.">Boeotian Coin.</head>
</figure> The government of Boeotia remained under the monarchical form till the death of Xanthus, who fell in single combat with Melanthus the Messenian, when it was determined to adopt a republican constitution. This, though imperfectly known to us, appears to have been a compound of aristocratic and democratic principles, the former being apparent in the appointment of thirteen annual magistrates named Boeotarchs (see <ref type="cross" target="crossboeotarches">Boeotarches</ref>), who presided over the military as well as civil departments; the latter in the establishment of four councils, which were possessed, in fact, of the sovereign authority, since all measures of importance were to be submitted to their deliberation. The general assembly of the Boeotian Republic was held in the temple of the Itonian Athené. From the extent and population of their territory the Boeotians might have played the first part in Greece, if they had not been prevented by the bad government of the cities, by the jealousy of Thebes, and the consequent want of union. And yet the example of <ref type="cross" target="crossepaminondas">Epaminondas</ref> (q.v.) and <ref type="cross" target="crosspelopidas">Pelopidas</ref> (q.v.) afterwards showed that the genius of two men could outweigh all these defects. The <cb /> Boeotians were regarded by their neighbours, the Athenians, as naturally a stupid race. Much of this, however, was wilful exaggeration, and must be ascribed to the national enmity which seems to have existed from the earliest times between these two nations. Moreover, this country produced, in fact, many illustrious men, such as Hesiod, Pindar, Plutarch, Epaminondas, and Pelopidas. In Boeotia, too, Mount Helicon was sacred to the Muses, to whom also many of the fountains and rivers of the country were consecrated. In Boeotia are several celebrated ancient battle-fields, the former glory of which has been increased by later events; namely, Plataea (now the village Kokla), where Pausanias and Aristides established the liberty of Greece by their victory over Mardonius; Leuctra, where Epaminondas triumphed over the Spartans; Coronea, where the Spartan Agesilaüs defeated the Thebans; and Chaeronea, where Philip founded Macedonian supremacy on the ruins of Grecian freedom. Near Tanagra, the birthplace of Corinna, the best wine was produced; here also cocks were bred, of remarkable size, beauty, and courage, with which the Grecian cities, passionately fond of cock-fighting, were supplied.</p>
 <p>The best-known towns of Boeotia were Orchomenus, Tegyra, Haliartus, Coronea, and Chaeronea, near Lake Copaïs; Larymna, Phocae, Aulis, Delium, and Oropus, near the Euripus; Thisbé, Ascra, Thespiae, and Leuctra, near the Gulf of Corinth; Thebae, in the plain between Lake Hylica and Mount Teumessus; Potniae and Therapnae, south of Thebes; and Plataeae, Erethrae, Eleum, Tanagra, and Pherae, in the valley of the Asopus.

<head orig="Boëthius">Boethius</head>

 <p> (better <hi rend="bold">Boëtius</hi>), <hi rend="SmallCaps">Anicius Manlius Torquātus Severīnus</hi>. A Roman statesman and scholar, born in Rome about A.D. 475, and one of the distinguished family of the Anicii, who had for some time been Christians. Having been left an orphan in his childhood, he was taken in his tenth year to Athens, where he remained eighteen years, and acquired a stock of knowledge far beyond the average. After his return to Rome, he was held in high esteem among his contemporaries for his learning and eloquence. He attracted the attention of Theodoric, who in A.D. 510 made him consul, and, in spite of his patriotic and independent attitude, gave him a prominent share in the government. The trial of the consul Albinus, however, brought with it the ruin of Boëthius. Albinus was accused of maintaining a secret understanding with the Byzantine court, and Boëthius stood up boldly in his defence, declaring that if Albinus was guilty, so was he, and the whole Senate with him. Thus involved in the same charge, he was sentenced to death by the cowardly assembly whose cause he had represented. He was thrown into prison at Pavia, and executed in the year 525. While in prison he wrote his famous work, <title>De Consolatione Philosophiae</title>, in five books, a splendid testimony to his noble mind and to his scholarly attainments. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> was published at Nuremberg in 1473 by Coburger. An Anglo-Saxon version made by Alfred the Great exists, of which an edition by Fox appeared in London in 1864. A good edition of the Latin text is that of Peiper <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1871)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Besides writing the treatise <title>De Consolatione</title>, Boëthius also translated many works on philosophy, rhetoric, and mathematics from the Greek, 
<pb n="214" /><cb />
 most of which are extant. His translations from Aristotle gave him much influence in the development of scholasticism; and his manuals of geometry, arithmetic, and music were long used in the mediaeval schools. He was the last Roman writer of any note to show a good knowledge of the Greek language and literature.

<head orig="Bona">Bona</head>

 <p> In Roman law, the word <seg lang="la">bona</seg> is (1) sometimes used to express the whole of a man's property; and in the phrases <seg lang="la">bonorum emptio, cessio, possessio</seg>, the word <seg lang="la">bona</seg> has this meaning. It expresses all that concerns a man's proprietary position, whether as owner, possessor, creditor, or <cb /> debtor. Thus the word <seg lang="la">bona</seg> is simply the property as an object; it does not express the nature of the relation between it and the person who has the ownership or enjoyment of it.
 </p>
 <p>(2) In some places the word <seg lang="la">bona</seg> is used to signify a man's assets, i. e. his property after the deduction of that which he owes. It is also used for separate portions of a man's property.</p>
 <p>The legal expression <seg lang="la">in bonis</seg>, as opposed to <seg lang="la">dominium</seg> or Quiritary ownership, means that property is held under a praetorian or equitable, and not under a civil or legal, title. The distinction is explained in the following passage of Gaius (ii. 40): “Among foreigners (<seg lang="la">peregrini</seg>) there is only one kind of ownership (<seg lang="la">dominium</seg>), so that a man is either the owner of a thing or he is not. And this was formerly the case among the Roman people; for a man was either owner <title>ex iure Quiritium</title>, or not owner at all. But afterwards the ownership was divided, so that now one man may be the owner of a thing according to strict law (<title>dominus ex iure Quiritium</title>), and at the same time another may be entitled to the beneficial ownership of it (<seg lang="la">in bonis habere</seg>). For instance, if I do not convey to you a <seg lang="la">res mancipi</seg>, either by the form of <seg lang="la">mancipatio</seg> or of <seg lang="la">in iure cessio</seg>, but simply deliver it to you, you acquire the praetorian title to the thing, but it will remain mine <title>ex iure Quiritium</title>, until possession gives you a civil title by usucaption. For when the usucaption is once complete, from that time it begins to be yours absolutely (<seg lang="la">pleno iure</seg>); that is, it is yours both <seg lang="la">in bonis</seg> and also yours <title>ex iure Quiritium</title>, just as if it had been mancipated to you, or transferred to you by <seg lang="la">in iure cessio.</seg>”</p>
 <p>Quiritary ownership originally and properly signified that ownership of a thing which was recognized by the law; it did not express a compound, but a simple notion, which was that of absolute ownership. But when it was once established that one man might have the Quiritary ownership, and another the sole right to the enjoyment of the same thing, the complete notion of Quiritary ownership became a notion compounded of the strict legal notion of ownership and that of the right to enjoy, as united in the same person. And as a man might have both the Quiritary ownership and the right to the enjoyment of a thing, so one might have the Quiritary ownership only, and another might have the enjoyment of it only. This bare ownership was sometimes expressed by the same terms (<title>ex iure Quiritium</title>) as that ownership which was complete, but sometimes it was appropriately called <title>nudum ius Quiritium</title> (<bibl n="Gaius  3. 100" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, iii. 100</bibl>). The historical origin of this double ownership is unknown.

<head orig="Bona Cadūca">Bona Caduca</head>

 <p> Caducum (from <seg lang="la">cado</seg>) signifies “that which falls,” and in its general legal sense might be anything without an owner, or what the person entitled to neglected to take ( <title>De Or.</title> iii. 31; <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 10. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phil.</title>x. 5</bibl>); but the strict legal sense of <seg lang="la">caducum</seg> and <seg lang="la">bona caduca</seg> is that stated by Ulpian (<title>Fragm.</title> tit. xvii. <seg lang="la">de caducis</seg>), which is as follows:</p>
 <p>If a thing is left by will to a person, so that he might take it by the <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg>, but from some cause does not take it, that thing is called <seg lang="la">caducum</seg>, as if it had fallen from him; for instance, if a legacy was left to an unmarried person, or a <title>Latinus Iunianus</title>, and the unmarried person did not within a hundred days obey the law (i. e. by marrying), 
<pb n="215" /><cb />
 or if within the same time the <title>Latinus</title> did not obtain the <title>ius Quiritium</title>, or if a <seg lang="la">heres ex parte</seg> or a legatee died or became a <seg lang="la">peregrinus</seg> before the opening of the will, the thing was <seg lang="la">caducum.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Caducum</title>, or lapse of a devise, implies that a valid devise has been made, which the devisee is unable or unwilling to take.</p>
 <p><title>Caducum</title> further implies that the will of which the lapsed devise is a part has come into operation. Strictly speaking, a devise which failed in the testator's lifetime was not <seg lang="la">caducum;</seg> it was, however, treated like a <seg lang="la">caducum</seg>, and so said to be <seg lang="la">in causa caduci</seg> (<title>Cod.</title> vi. 51, 2).</p>
 <p>Either a share of an inheritance or a particular <seg lang="la">legatum</seg> might become <seg lang="la">caducum.</seg> The law alluded to in the passage of Ulpian cited above is the Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea. This law, which was passed in the time of Augustus (A.D. 9), had the double object of encouraging marriages and enriching the treasury—<seg lang="la">aerarium</seg> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 25</bibl>) —and contained with reference to these two objects a great number of provisions. Martial (v. 75) alludes to a person who married in order to comply with the law. For the <seg lang="la">dos caduca</seg>, see <ref type="cross" target="crossdos">Dos</ref>.

<head orig="Bona Dea">Bona Dea</head>

 <p> (“The good goddess”). An Italian deity, supposed to preside over the earth and all the blessings which spring from it. She was also the patron goddess of chastity and fruitfulness in women. The names Fauna, Maia, and Ops were originally no more than varying appellations given by the priests to the Bona Dea. She is represented in works of art with a sceptre in her left hand, a wreath of vine leaves on her head, and a jar of wine at her side. Near her image was a consecrated serpent; indeed, a number of tame serpents were kept in her temple, which was situated in Rome on the slope of the Aventine. All kinds of healing plants were preserved in her sanctuary. She was regarded in Rome as an austere virgin goddess, whose temple men were forbidden to enter. She belonged, accordingly, to the circle of deities who were worshipped by the Vestal Virgins. The anniversary of the foundation of her temple was held on the 1st of May, when prayers were offered up to her for the averting of earthquakes. Besides this, a secret festival was held to her on behalf of the public welfare, in the house of the officiating consul or praetor of the city, by matrons and the Vestal Virgins, on the night of May 3-4. The mistress of the house presided. No man was allowed to be present at this celebration, or even to hear the name of the goddess. After offering a sacrifice of sucking pigs, the women performed a dance, accompanied by stringed and wind instruments. Under the Empire the festival degenerated into a mystic performance of extravagant and indecent character ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 313" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 313</bibl>).

 <p> As will be seen by reference to the article <ref type="cross" target="crossbonam-copiam-iurare">Bonam Copiam Iurare</ref>, the principle of relieving insolvent debtors, who fulfilled certain conditions, from liability to imprisonment was recognized to some extent under the Republic. Iulius Caesar, when consul, B.C. 48, as a temporary measure of relief in time of distress, owing to the Civil War, discharged debtors who made over their property to their creditors from their debts ( <title>De Bell. Civ.</title> iii. 1; cf. Poste's <title>Gaius</title>, p. 347, 2d ed.).</p>
 <p><title>Cessio bonorum</title> was introduced by a Lex Iulia. This law allowed an insolvent debtor to make a voluntary assignment of his property to his creditors. By making such assignment, the debtor obtained three advantages: (1) He escaped imprisonment.</p>
 <p>(2) He did not become <seg lang="la">infamis.</seg></p>
 <p>(3) In respect to property acquired subsequently to the assignment, he had the <seg lang="la">beneficium competentiae</seg> when sued by his old creditors—i. e. he could retain sufficient for his bare maintenance. He had not this right against creditors who had become so subsequent to the act of assignment. The property assigned by the debtor was sold by the process of <seg lang="la">bonorum emptio</seg> (q. v.), the proceeds being distributed among the creditors. It is to be noticed that the assignment did not operate as a discharge, after-acquired property being liable, subject to the limitation explained above.

<div2 id="crossbopp" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Bopp</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Franz</foreName>
 <p>The founder of the science of comparative philology, and one of the pioneers of Sanskrit studies in Germany, born at Mayence, September 14th, 1791. His parents having removed to Aschaffenburg, the young Bopp there attended the gymnasium, and afterwards enjoyed the instruction of Windischmann. At the suggestion of Windischmann, he went to Paris in 1812 to continue his studies in Oriental languages, especially in Sanskrit, and after five years in Paris to London, where he remained until 1820. During his sojourn in Paris and London he received from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences an annual stipend of 1000 florins. In 1820 he was anxious to be made Professor of Sanskrit at Würzburg, but the authorities considered it entirely unnecessary to create a chair for that language. In the following year, however, <cb /> the brothers Von Humboldt, after great exertions in his behalf, had him appointed <seg lang="la">professor extraordinarius</seg> for Oriental languages and the science of language at Berlin, where he was made a member of the Academy in 1822, and <seg lang="la">professor ordinarius</seg> in 1825—a position in which he was active until stricken with apoplexy in 1864. He died October 23d, 1867.</p>
 <p>His principal works in the field of comparative philology are: <bibl default="NO"><title>Ueber das Conjugationssystem der Sanskrit-Sprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen, lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache</title> (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1816)</bibl>, published in an English translation in 1819; <bibl default="NO"><title>Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Send, Armenischen, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litauischen, Altslawischen, Gotischen und Deutschen</title> (Berlin, 1833-52; second edition 1856-61, third edition, posthumously, 1868-71)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Die keltischen Sprachen in ihrem Verhältnisse zum Sanskrit u. s. w.</title> (Berlin, 1839)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Ueber das Albanesische in seinen verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen</title> (Berlin, 1855)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Vergleichendes Accentuationssystem</title> (Berlin, 1854)</bibl>. His Sanskrit publications include considerable extracts from the <title>Mahabhârata</title>, very valuable works on Sanskrit grammar, and the <title>Glossarium Sanscritum.</title></p>
 <p>Bopp was not, it is true, the first to remark upon the striking resemblance of Sanskrit to the classical and other European languages. That resemblance had been observed before 1588 by Filippo Sassetti, and subsequently by many others, noticeably by Père Coeurdoux in 1767, and by Sir William Jones in 1786; Jones claimed a common origin for Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, <ref type="cross" target="crosslatin">Latin, Gothic, and Keltic—an idea carried out in much greater detail by Friedrich von Schlegel</ref> (q.v.) in 1808. It was, however, reserved for Bopp to put this startling doctrine (for such, and even preposterous, it seemed to most classical scholars of that day) upon a scientific basis; and this he did, at the early age of twenty-five. His predecessors had noted chiefly the resemblances between individual words of Sanskrit and those other languages; Bopp turned his gaze upon the grammatical structure of all these tongues, and was convinced of its substantial identity in them all. The results of his investigations are embodied in the <title>Conjugationssystem.</title> The same method was thereafter applied successfully to the investigation of other families of speech. Bopp's object was, however, not merely the comparison of languages—this was with him only the means to an end—he sought to explain by this method the genesis of inflectional forms. His views on this point seem to have passed through three stages of development. (1) The first stage is represented by the <title>Conjugationssystem</title> of 1816. Friedr. von Schlegel (<bibl default="NO"><title>Sprache und Weisheit der Indier</title>, 1808</bibl>) had divided all languages into two groups, the <hi rend="italic">inflectional</hi> and the <seg lang="la">agglutinative;</seg> inflection he called exclusively an <seg lang="la">inner change</seg> of the word, and denied to “suffixes” a derivation from originally independent words. Bopp adopted Schlegel's theory, but expanded it thus: a word may not only modify itself internally, but may absorb the “verbum substantivum,” <seg lang="la">esse.</seg></p>
 <p>Bopp was clearly still under the influence of a doctrine commonly held at that time, that every sentence is necessarily a reflection of a logical judgment; as the result of this doctrine he declares that in strictness there can exist but one real verb, the verb <hi rend="italic">to be.</hi></p>
 <p>(2) Three years later, in the English edition of the <title>Conjugationssystem</title>, Bopp 
<pb n="217" /><cb />
 adopted the principle of <hi rend="italic">composition</hi> to account for inflectional forms. The doctrine of roots had been advanced in Europe some forty years before, and Bopp, finding it not only substantiated by the structure of Sanskrit, but also expressed in detail by the ancient Hindû grammarians, made it his own task to account for the existing forms of language. A more important deviation from Schlegel's views is Bopp's derivation of the personal endings of the verb from the personal pronouns—an idea probably obtained indirectly from observation of the Semitic languages. “Of real inflections (in the Schlegelian sense) Bopp now recognizes only certain vowel-changes and the reduplication.”</p>
 <p>(3) In his <bibl default="NO"><title>Comparative Grammar</title> (1833)</bibl>, Bopp, breaking completely with Schlegel, commits himself to the “agglutinative” theory, according to which all words of Indo-European languages are derived from monosyllabic roots, which are either <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pronominal;</hi> the forms of inflection arise entirely from the combination of different roots, of which, in each combination, all but one have assumed a purely subordinate and modifying character. A curious <hi rend="italic">symbolic</hi> principle is also advanced by him (e. g. the feminine forms are “fuller and rounder”), and a <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> principle of balance, regulating the “weight” of syllables. Bopp speaks often of “physical laws” (which are nowadays called “phonetic laws”), and draws frequent metaphors from the natural sciences. Of great significance for his linguistic views are also his frequent personification of language, and the persistence with which he speaks only of its <hi rend="italic">decay</hi>, of deterioration from an earlier stage of perfection, and not of its simultaneous <hi rend="italic">growth.</hi></p>
 <p>Bopp's discoveries resulted less from any strictly scientific method of investigation instituted by him than from his remarkable genius, and it can therefore hardly be said that he founded a school. Though his discoveries needed much supplementing in detail (which they received in very great measure through the learning and genius of Pott); though his inclusion of the Malay-Polynesian languages in the Indo-European group has been entirely rejected by later scholars; and though his <title>Comparative Grammar</title> has been superseded by later works; yet the foundations of comparative philology are still in the main as he constructed them; and but for him linguistic students might still be building upon sand, as they built, and could not but build, ere his day.</p>
 <p>The most recent and extensive work concerning Bopp is S. Lefmann's <bibl default="NO"><title>Franz Bopp: sein Leben und seine Wissenschaft</title> (vol. i., Berlin, 1891)</bibl>, containing in a voluminous appendix Bopp's correspondence, never before published, with Windischmann, De Sacy, and other scholars of note. The best characterization of Bopp's scientific position is, however, still to be found in Delbrück's <bibl default="NO"><title>Introduction to the Study of Language</title> (English translation by Miss Channing, Leipzig, 1884)</bibl>, from which the above sketch is largely taken. See also an article by Kuhn A. in <title>Unsere Zeit</title>, 1868; and one by Brugmann and Streitberg, forming an Introduction to vol. i. <bibl default="NO">(1891-92)</bibl> of their new periodical, <title>Indogermanische Forschungen.</title> The same volume also contains a notice of Lefmann's book.

A festival celebrated by the Athenians in honour of Boreas, which, as Herodotus (vii. 189) seems to think, was instituted during the Persian War, when the Athenians, being commanded by an oracle to invoke their <foreign lang="greek">γαμβρὸς ἐπίκουρος</foreign>, prayed to Boreas. The fleet of Xerxes was soon afterwards almost entirely destroyed by a north wind, near Cape Sepias, and the grateful Athenians erected to his honour a temple on the banks of the Ilissus. Possibly, however, this merely revived an earlier celebration. A similar festival of Boreas was celebrated annually at Megalopolis, and by the Thurians. See Aelian, <title>V. H.</title> xii. 61.

<head orig="Bospŏrus">Bosporus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βόσπορος</foreign>). A name applied to a strait of the sea. There were two straits known in antiquity by this appellation, namely, the Thracian and the Cimmerian Bosporus; the former now known by the name of the Straits or Channel of Constantinople, the latter the Straits of Caffa or 
<pb n="218" /><cb />
 Theodosia, or, according to a later denomination, the Straits of Yenikalé. It connects the Palus Maeotis (Sea of Azov) with the Euxine. Various reasons have been assigned for the name. The best is that which makes the appellation refer to the early passage of agricultural knowledge from East to West (<foreign lang="greek">βοῦς</foreign>, an ox, and <foreign lang="greek">πόρος</foreign>, a passage). Nymphius tells us, on the authority of Accarion, that the Phrygians, desiring to pass the Thracian strait, built a vessel, on whose prow was the figure of an ox, calling the strait over which it carried them <foreign lang="greek">βοὸς πόρος</foreign>, Bosporus, or the ox's passage (cf. Oxford in English). Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Valerius Flaccus and others of the ancient writers <figure id="fig.00218">
<head orig="Map of the Propontis and the Thracian Bosporus.">Map of the Propontis and the Thracian Bosporus.</head>
</figure> refer the name to the history of Io, who, when transformed into a cow (<foreign lang="greek">βοῦς</foreign>) by Heré, swam across this strait to avoid her tormentor. Arrian says that the Phrygians were directed by an oracle to follow the route which an ox would point out to them, and that on one being roused by them for this purpose, it swam across the strait. (See Aesch. <title>Prom. Vinc.</title> 732; <bibl n="Aristot.

It is said to be sixteen miles in length, including the windings of its course, and its ordinary breadth about one and a half miles. In several places, however, it is very narrow; and the ancients relate that a person might hear birds sing on the opposite side, and that two persons might converse across it.

<div2 id="crossboule" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Boulé">Boule</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βουλή</foreign>). In the Homeric Age, a Boulé, or council of principal men, was probably a wellestablished and important feature in every Greek state. The Boulé of the Greek army before Troy consists of the kings or principal chieftains (<foreign lang="greek">βασιλῆες, γέροντες</foreign>), who meet at the call of Agamemnon, commander-in-chief, for free and equal debate on questions of policy.</p>
 <p>In historical times, a Boulé is found in very many Greek states, but it is only at Athens that the institution is intimately known to us. Here there were, strictly speaking, two bodies bearing this name—the Senate of the Areopagus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossareopagus">Areopagus</ref>) and the Senate of Five Hundred. It is the latter body which is always meant when the Boulé is spoken of without further designation, and it is this which is here described.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Composition, Organization, etc</hi>.—The membership of the Boulé, which under the Solonian constitution had been 400, 100 from each of the four old tribes, was raised by Clisthenes (B.C. 508-507) to 500, 50 from each of the ten new tribes. When, in 306, the tribes were increased to twelve, the Boulé was increased to 600, but in the time of Hadrian it was reduced to 500 again. The senators (<foreign lang="greek">βουλευταί</foreign>) had to be at least thirty years of age. Their term of service was from the beginning to the end of an Attic year. They were selected by lot; the senators of one tribe not being taken indiscriminately from the entire tribe, but so that each deme of the tribe should have a fixed number of members. Possibly the demes nominated candidates by ballot, and the lot was used only to select the necessary number from among these nominees. Every senator, before entering into office, had to undergo an examination (<foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασία</foreign>) by the retiring Senate. At the expiration of his term he had to render an account (<foreign lang="greek">εὔθυνα</foreign>) of his official career.</p>
 <p>In order to facilitate the despatch of business and to secure rotation of authority, the year was divided into ten periods (35 or 36 days each, in ordinary years), called <hi rend="italic">prytanies</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖαι</foreign>); and the senators of each tribe in turn assumed the leadership for one prytany, under the name of <seg lang="la">prytanes</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πρυτάνεις</foreign>). The prytanes had their headquarters in the <seg lang="la">prytaneum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖον</foreign>), or <seg lang="la">tholos</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">θόλος</foreign>), a circular building near the Senate-house (<foreign lang="greek">βουλευτήριον</foreign>). Matters of business could here be brought before them, with a view to prompt consideration by Senate and Ecclesia. Every day one of the prytanes was selected by lot as <seg lang="la">epistates</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης τῶν πρυτανέων</foreign>). He kept the public 
<pb n="219" /><cb />
 seal and the keys of the temples in which were deposited the public treasure and the public archives. In the fifth century this epistates also presided at the meeting of the Boulé held on his day, as well as at the meeting of the Ecclesia, if one was held. Early in the fourth century, perhaps in 378-377, a more complicated method of securing a chairman was introduced. The aforesaid epistates selected by lot nine <seg lang="la">proëdri</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πρόεδροι</foreign>), one from each of the non-prytanizing tribes, and out of the proëdri a second <seg lang="la">epistates</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης τῶν προέδρων</foreign>), to serve as chairman and carry forward, with the assistance of his fellow-proëdri, the legislative business of the day. No one could serve as <foreign lang="greek">επιστάτης τῶν πρυτανέων</foreign> or as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης τῶν προ-</foreign> <figure id="fig.00219">

</figure> <foreign lang="greek">έδρων</foreign> for more than one day in the same year. The Boulé had also a secretary (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματεύς</foreign>), who kept the records of both Boulé and Ecclesia. A session was held every day, except holidays; there would perhaps be 300 sessions in a year. The usual place of meeting was the <foreign lang="greek">βουλευτήριον</foreign>, near the Agora. The pay for attendance was, in Aristotle's time, five obols per day.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Functions:</hi> (1) <title>Legislative.</title>—According to the theory of the Athenian constitution, no subject could be acted upon in the Ecclesia until it had been considered in the Boulé and a bill (<foreign lang="greek">προβούλευμα</foreign>) there drawn up. The Boulé, however, was a mere committee of the Ecclesia, not a co-ordinate legislative body. Its concurrence was not necessary to the passage of a measure.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>Administrative.</title>—These were very numerous and extensive. For example: the Boulé decided on the claims of pauper cripples to receive the dole provided for by law; it determined who should belong to the cavalry (<foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign>), and inspected the cavalry horses, condemning the unfit; it superintended the navy and the docks; above all, it had a general oversight of the public finance, presiding over the farming of taxes, the renting of mines, payments to the special financial officials, etc. These and other administrative duties doubtless constituted the bulk of the work of the Boulé.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <title>Judicial.</title>—The Boulé, like other magistracies, could punish those who violated its authority. It could also, either of its own motion or on the denunciation (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγγελία</foreign>) of a private citizen, pass sentence on officials, especially financial officials, for malfeasance in office. In the period of the developed democracy its power, in most cases, seems to have been limited to the imposition of a fine of 500 drachmas. The evidence, however, on this point is confusing. See J. W. Headlam, <title>Election by Lot at Athens</title>, chap. ii.

<div2 id="crossbracae" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Bracae">Bracae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναξυρίδες, θύλακοι</foreign>). Trousers; pantaloons. These were common to all the nations that encircled the Greek and Roman population, extending from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean. Hence Aristagoras, king of Miletus, in his interview with Cleomenes, king of Sparta, described the attire of a large portion of them in these terms: “They carry bows and a short spear, and go to battle in trousers and with hats upon their heads.” Hence, also, the phrase <seg lang="la">bracati militis arcus</seg>, implying that those who wore trousers were in general armed with the bow. In particular, we are informed of the use of trousers or pantaloons among the following nations: (1) The Medes and Persians (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ τὰ σκέλεα ἀναξυρίδας</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(2) The Parthians and Armenians.</p>
 <p>(3) The Phrygians.</p>
 <p>(4) The Sacae.</p>
 <p>(5) The Sarmatae.</p>
 <p>(6) The Dacians and Getae.</p>
 <p>(7) The Teutones.</p>

 <p>The Gallic term “brakes,” which Diodorus Siculus has preserved in the last-cited passage (lv. 30), also survives in the Scottish “breeks” and the English “breeches.” Corresponding terms are used in all the Northern languages. (See Skeat, 
<pb n="220" /><cb /> <title>Etymolog. Dict.</title> s. v. “Breeches.”) The Cossack and Persian trousers of the present day differ in no material respect from those which were anciently worn in the same countries.</p>
 <p>In conformity with the preceding list of testimonies, the monuments of every kind which contain representations of the nations included in it, exhibit them in trousers, thus clearly distinguishing them from Greeks and Romans. An example is seen in the annexed group of Sarmatians, taken from the Column of Trajan. <figure id="fig.00220">
<head orig="Sarmatians wearing Bracae. (Column of Trajan.)">Sarmatians wearing Bracae. (Column of Trajan.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The proper bracae of the Eastern and Northern nations were loose (<foreign lang="greek">κεχαλασμέναι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">laxae</seg>), and they are therefore very aptly, though ludicrously, described in Euripides as “variegated bags” (<foreign lang="greek">τοὺς θυλάκους τοὺς ποικίλους</foreign>).

</figure> have appeared highly ridiculous, although Ovid mentions the adoption of them by the descendants of some of the Greek colonists on the Euxine (<title>Trist.</title> v. 11, 34).</p>
 <p>Trousers were principally woollen; but Agathias states that in Europe they were also made of linen and of leather; probably the Asiatics made them of cotton and of silk. Sometimes they were striped (<seg lang="la">virgatae</seg>), ornamented with a woof of various colours.</p>
 <p>Roman soldiers fighting in the North were obliged to wear them, owing to the severity of the climate; and by the second century they were worn even at Rome. The emperor Alexander Severus wore white bracae; some of his predecessors, scarlet ones (<seg lang="la">coccineae</seg>).</p>

<div2 id="crossbracciolini" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Bracciolini</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gian Francesco Poggio</foreName>
 <p>, one of the most noted names in the history of classical study, was born at Terranova, near Florence, in 1380. He studied Latin under John of Ravenna, and Greek under Manuel Chrysoloras, after which he became a copyist of manuscripts, in which pursuit his dexterity brought him the acquaintance of the chief scholars of Florence, by whose aid he was received into the service of the Roman curia <bibl default="NO">(1403)</bibl> as a secretary. In this office he showed himself an enthusiastic advocate of classical study, and took a most important part in the revival of learning, caring little or nothing for the exciting political and ecclesiastical movements of the period. Bracciolini (or Poggio, as he is usually called) is best known for his remarkable success in recovering the lost masterpieces of Latin literature by his researches in the libraries of monasteries and convents, where manuscripts of priceless value to the classicist were lying hitherto unknown. In one of his epistles he relates how he discovered at St. Gall, in Switzerland, Quintilian, Verrius Flaccus (in part), and the commentaries of Asconius Pedianus. To him, likewise, we owe manuscripts of Lucretius, Columella, Silius Italicus, Manilius, Vitruvius, Ammianus Marcellinus, Nonius Marcellus , Probus, Flavius Caper, and Eutyches. At Langres he unearthed Cicero's oration <title>Pro Caecina</title>, and at Monte Cassino a codex of Frontinus. No considerations of morality stood in Bracciolini's way when the question of securing a valuable manuscript was before him. If a codex could be gained only by fraud, he employed fraud, as when he actually bribed a monk at Hersfeld to abstract manuscripts of Livy and Ammianus from the convent library.</p>
 <p>Bracciolini was an extensive traveller, and has left some lively pictures of the contemporary life and customs of different European countries, especially of England and Switzerland, as well as some curious notes on the remains of antique art in Rome. He likewise describes the trial of Jerome of Prague. To pure literature he was a voluminous contributor, writing orations, epistles, treatises on rhetoric, translations from the Greek, moral essays, and fabliaux, all in Latin, as well as a history of Florence, written in imitation of the style of Livy. His <title>Facetiae</title> are remarkable alike for their indecency and for their caustic satires on the secular clergy. Of this class, his most famous writings are his violent and often filthy diatribes against Valla and Filelfo, who retorted in kind, and thus established a bad precedent which was followed in the later controversies of the Scaligers (q. v.), Scioppius, Salmasius, and Milton.</p>
 <p>Bracciolini, who remained a layman until his death, retired in 1452 to Florence, of which republic he became the chancellor and historian. There he died in 1459, and was buried in the Church of Santa Croce. A statue of him by Donatello commemorates his services to the humanities. His life has been written in English by Shepherd <bibl default="NO">(Liverpool, 1802)</bibl>. See also  SymondsA. , <bibl default="NO"><title>The Renaissance in Italy</title> (1886)</bibl>.

<head orig="Brauronia">Brauronia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Βραυρώνια</foreign>). An Attic festival held every fifth year in the little town of Brauron, in honour of Artemis Brauronia. At Brauron, Orestes and <ref type="cross" target="crossiphigenia">Iphigenia</ref> (q.v.) on their return from Tauris were supposed to have landed and to have left the statue of the Tauric goddess. The festival was under the superintendence of ten <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign>; and the chief solemnity consisted in the circumstance that Attic girls between the ages of five and ten years, dressed in crocus-coloured garments, went in solemn procession to the sanctuary, where they were consecrated to the goddess. During this act, the <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign> sacrificed a goat, and the girls-performed a propitiatory rite in which they imitated bears. This rite may have simply arisen from the fact that the bear was sacred to Artemis, especially in Arcadia; but a tradition preserved in Suidas relates its origin as follows: In the Attic town of Phanidae a bear was <cb /> kept, which was so tame that it was allowed to go about quite freely, and received its food from and among men. One day a girl ventured to play with it, and, on treating the animal rather harshly, it turned round and tore her to pieces. Her brothers, enraged at this, went out and killed the bear. The Athenians thereupon were visited by a plague; and when they consulted the oracle, the auswer was given that they would rid themselves of the evil which had befallen them if they would compel some of their citizens to make their daughters propitiate Artemis by a rite called <foreign lang="greek">ἀρκτεύειν</foreign>, for the crime committed against the animal sacred to the goddess. The command was more than obeyed; for the Athenians decreed that from thenceforth all women, before they could marry, should have once taken part in this festival, and have been consecrated to the goddess. Hence the girls themselves were called <foreign lang="greek">ἄρκτοι</foreign>, the consecration <foreign lang="greek">ἀρκτεία</foreign>, the act of consecrating <foreign lang="greek">ἀρκτεύειν</foreign>, and to celebrate the festival <foreign lang="greek">ἀρκτεύεσθαι</foreign>.</p>
 <p>There was also a quinquennial festival called Brauronia, which was celebrated by men and dissolute women, at Brauron, in honour of Dionysus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βρεττανία</foreign>), called also <ref type="cross" target="crossalbion">Albion</ref>. An island in the Atlantic Ocean, and the largest in Europe. The Phoenicians appear to have been early acquainted with it, and to have carried on there a traffic for tin. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscassiterides">Cassiterides</ref>.) Commercial jealousy, however, induced them to keep their discoveries a profound secret. The Carthaginians succeeded to the Phoenicians, but were equally mysterious. <ref type="cross" target="crossavienus">Avienus</ref> (q.v.) in his poem entitled <title>Ora Maritima</title>, makes mention of the voyages of a certain Himilco, in this quarter, and professes to draw his information from the long-concealed Punic annals. Little was known of Britain until Caesar's time, who invaded and endeavoured, although ineffectually, to conquer the island. After a long interval, Ostorius, in the reign of Claudius, reduced the southern part of Britannia; and Agricola subsequently, in the reign of Domitian, extended the Roman dominion to the Frith of Forth and the Clyde. The whole force of the Empire, although exerted to the utmost under Septimius Severus, could not, however, reduce to subjection the hardy natives of the highlands. This emperor divided the country into two parts—Britannia Inferior or Southern 
<pb n="223" /><cb /> Britain, and Britannia Superior or Northern Britain—each under a special prefect. When the Empire was divided under Diocletian, Britain became a diocese of the <seg lang="la">praefectura</seg> of Gaul, and was governed by a <seg lang="la">vicarius</seg> residing at Eboracum (York). At this time it was marked out into five provinces, as follows: Britannia Prima (England south of the Thames), Britannia Secunda (Wales), Flavia Caesariensis (between the Thames, Severn, Mersey, and Humber), Maxima Caesariensis (all the rest of England up to the Wall of Hadrian), and Valentia (Scotland south of the Wall of Antoninus). Ptolemy enumerates fifty-six towns (<seg lang="la">coloniae, municipia</seg>) of Roman Britain, two of which (Eboracum and Verulamium) had the rights of Roman citizenship. Eboracum, Deva (Chester, <seg lang="la">castra</seg>), and Isca (Caerleon) were military centres, each being the station for a legion of Roman soldiers, chiefly, however, Gauls, Germans, and Iberians.</p>

</figure> Britain may be seen in the great number of their remains that have been found, including roads, houses, baths, painted walls, altars, ornaments, mosaics, sculpture, bronzes, coins, pottery, and various implements. Britain continued a Roman province until A.D. 426, when the troops, having been in a great measure withdrawn to assist Valentinian III. against the Huns, never returned. The Britons had become so enervated under the Roman yoke as to be unable to repel the incursions of the inhabitants of the north. They invoked, therefore, the aid of the Saxons (A.D. 407), by whom they were themselves subjugated and at length obliged to take refuge in the mountains of Wales.</p>
 <p>The name Britain was unknown to the Romans before the time of Caesar; though Aristotle as early as the fourth century B.C. speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">νῆσοι Βρεταννικαί</foreign>. Some deduce the name of the Britons from the Gallic <title>Britti</title> (Cymric <hi rend="italic">brîth</hi>), “painted,” in allusion to the custom of a part of the inhabitants of painting their bodies; but Rhys rejects this etymology, without suggesting any that is more plausible. The other name, Albion, is etymologically connected with the Gaelic <hi rend="italic">alp</hi>, “a high hill,” or the Latin <seg lang="la">albus</seg>, “white.” This was undoubtedly the Keltic name of the whole island.</p>
 <p>Britain was famous for its Roman walls, of which traces remain to the present day. The first was built by Agricola, A.D. 79, nearly in the situation of the rampart of Hadrian and wall of Severus mentioned below. In A.D. 81, Agricola built a line of very strong forts from the Frith of Forth to the Frith of Clyde. This, however, was insufficient to check the barbarians after his departure. In A.D. 120, therefore, Hadrian erected a famous wall from Boulness on Solway Frith to a spot a little beyond Newcastle-upon-Tyne. It was sixty-eight English or seventy-four Roman miles long. Twenty years after this, Lollius Urbicus, under the emperor Antoninus, restored the second wall of Agricola, which is commonly called the Vallum <cb /> Antonini. But the greatest of all was that of Severus, begun A.D. 209, and finished the next year, and which was only a few yards north of Hadrian's wall. It was garrisoned by ten thousand men.

Her sphere was Nature in its greatness and its freedom.

She was the danghter of a huntress much beloved by Zeus and Artemis. Minos loved her, and followed her for nine months over valley and mountain, through forest and swamp, till he nearly overtook her, when she leaped from a high rock into the sea.

The country is mountainous, as the Apennines run through it down to the Sicilian Straits; it contained excellent pasturage for cattle, and the valleys produced good corn, olives, and fruit. The earliest inhabitants of the country were Oenotrians. Subsequently some Lucanians, who had revolted from their countrymen in Lucania, took possession of the country, and were hence called Bruttii or Brettii, which word is said to mean “rebels” in the language of the Lucanians. This people, however, inhabited only the interior of the land; the coast was almost entirely in the possession of the Greek colonies. At the close of the Second Punic War, in which the Bruttii had been the allies of Hannibal, they lost their independence, and were treated by the Romans with great severity.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Iunius Brutus</hi>. A celebrated Roman, the author, according to the Roman legends, of the great revolution which drove Tarquin the Proud from his throne, and which substituted the consular for the regal government. He was the son of Marcus Iunius and of Tarquinia, the second daughter of Tarquin. While yet young in years, he saw his father and brother slain by the order of Tarquin, and having no means of avenging them, and fearing the same fate to himself, he affected a stupid air, in order not to appear at all formidable in the eyes of a suspicious and cruel tyrant. This artifice proved successful, and he so far deceived Tarquin and the other members of the royal family that they gave him, in derision, the surname of Brutus, as indicative of his supposed mental imbecility. At length, when Lucretia had been outraged by Sextus Tarquinius, Brutus, amid the indignation that pervaded all orders, threw off the mask, and suatching the dagger from the bosom of the victim, swore upon it eternal exile to the family of Tarquin. Wearied out with the tyranny of this monarch, and exasperated by the spectacle of the funeral solemnities of Lucretia, the people abolished royalty, and confided the chief authority to the Senate and two magistrates, named at first praetors, but subsequently consuls. Brutus and the husband of Lucretia were first invested with this important office. They signalized their entrance upon its duties by making all the people take a solemn oath never again to have a king of Rome. Efforts, nevertheless, were soon made in favour of the Tarquins: an ambassador sent from Etruria, under the pretext of procuring a restoration of the property of Tarquin and his family, formed a secret plot for the overthrow of the new government; and the sons of Brutus became

 connected with the conspiracy. A discovery having been made, the sons of the consul and their accomplices were tried, condemned, and executed by the orders of the father, although the people were willing that he should pardon them. From this time, Brutus sought only to die himself, and, some months after, a battle between the Romans and the troops of Tarquin enabled him to gratify his wish. He encountered, in the fight, Aruns, the son of the exiled monarch; and with so much impetuosity did they rush to the attack that both fell dead on the spot, pierced to the heart each by the weapon of the other. The corpse of Brutus was carried to Rome in triumph. <figure id="fig.00225.2">

 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Iunius Brutus</hi>, father of the Brutus who was concerned in the assassination of Caesar. He embraced the party of Marius, and was overcome by Pompey. After the death of Sulla , and the renewal of hostilities, he was besieged in Mutina by Pompey, who compelled him to surrender after a long resistance, and caused him to be put to death. He was brother-in-law to Cato by his wife Servilia. Brutus was an able <cb /> lawyer, and wrote on the Civil Wars ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>62</bibl>; id. <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 2. 32" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>ii. 32</bibl>; id. <title>Pro Cluent.</title> 51).</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Iunius Brutus</hi>, son of the preceding, was by the mother's side nephew of M. Cato (Uticensis). He accompanied his uncle to Cyprus, <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 695, where the latter was sent by Clodius to annex that island to the Roman Empire. It appears, however, that he did not copy the example of Cato 's integrity; for, having become the creditor of the citizens of Salamis to a large amount, he employed one Scaptius, a man of infamous character, to enforce the payment of the debt, together with an interest four times exceeding the rate allowed by law ( <title>Ad Att.</title> v. 21). When Cicero governed the province of Cilicia, to which Cyprus seems to have been annexed, Brutus wrote to him, and was supported by Atticus in his request, entreating him to give Scaptius a commission as an officer of the Roman government, and to allow him to employ a military force to exact from the Salaminians the usurious interest which he illegally demanded. Cicero was too upright a magistrate to comply with such requests, but they were so agreeable to the practice of the times that he continued to live on intimate terms with the man who could prefer them; and the literary tastes of Brutus were a recommendation which he could not resist; so that he appears soon to have forgotten the affair of Scaptius, and to have spoken and thought of Brutus with great regard. They both, indeed, were of the same party in politics, and Brutus actively exerted himself in the service of Pompey, although his own father had been put to death by the orders of that commander. Being taken prisoner in the battle of Pharsalia, he received his life from the conqueror. Before Caesar set out for Africa to carry on war against Scipio and Iuba, he conferred on Brutus the government of Cisalpine Gaul, and in that province Brutus accordingly remained, and was actually holding an office under Caesar while his uncle Cato was maintaining the contest in Africa and committed suicide rather than fall alive into the hands of the enemy. His character, however, seems to have been greatly improved since his treatment of the Salaminians, for he is said to have governed Cisalpine Gaul with great integrity and humanity. In the year B.C. 45 he returned to Rome, but afterwards set out to meet Caesar on his return from Spain, and, in an interview which he had with him at Nicaea, pleaded the cause of Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, with such warmth and freedom that Caesar was struck by it, and was reminded of what he used frequently to say of Brutus—that what his inclinations might be made a very great difference; but that, whatever they were, they would be nothing lukewarm. It was about this time also that Brutus divorced his first wife, Appia, daughter of Appius Claudius, and married the famous Porcia, his cousin, the daughter of Cato. Soon after, he received another mark of Caesar's favour, in being appointed praetor urbanus, B.C. 44; and he was holding that office when he resolved to become the assassin of the man whose government he had twice acknowledged by consenting to act in a public station under it. He was led into the conspiracy, it is said, by Cassius, who sought at 
<pb n="226" /><cb />
 first by writing, and afterwards by means of his wife Iunia, the sister of Brutus, to obtain his consent to become an accomplice; and Plutarch informs us that when the attack was made on Caesar in the Senate-house, the latter resisted and endeavoured to escape, until he saw the dagger of <figure id="fig.00226">
<head orig="Marcus Iunius Brutus.">Marcus Iunius Brutus.</head>
</figure> Brutus pointed against him, when he covered his head with his robe and resigned himself to his fate. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaesar">Caesar</ref>.</p>
 <p>After the assassination of Caesar, the conspirators endeavoured to stir up the feelings of the people in favour of liberty; but Antony, by reading the will of the dictator, excited against them so violent a storm of odium that they were compelled to flee from the city. Brutus retired to Athens, and used every exertion to raise a party there among the Roman nobility. Obtaining possession, at the same time, of a large sum of the public money, he was enabled to bring to his standard many of the old soldiers of Pompey who were scattered about Thessaly. His forces daily increasing, he soon saw himself surrounded by a considerable army, and Hortensius, the governor of Macedonia, aiding him, Brutus became master in this way of all Greece and Macedonia. He went now to Asia and joined Cassius, whose efforts had been equally successful. In Rome, on the other hand, the triumvirs were all-powerful; the conspirators had been condemned, and the people had taken up arms against them. Brutus and Cassius returned to Europe to oppose the triumvirs, and Octavius and Antony met them on the plains of Philippi. In this memorable conflict Brutus commanded the right wing of the republican army, and defeated the division of the enemy opposed to him, and would in all probability have gained the day if, instead of pursuing the fugitives, he had brought reinforcements to his left wing, commanded by Cassius, which was hard pressed and eventually beaten by Antony. Cassius, upon this, believing everything lost, slew himself in despair. Brutus bitterly deplored his fate, styling him, with tears of the sincerest sorrow, “the last of the Romans.” On the following day, induced by the ardour of the soldiers, Brutus again drew up his forces in line of battle, but no action took place, and he then took possession of an advantageous post, where it was difficult for an attack to be made upon him. His true policy was to have remained in this state, without hazarding an engagement, for his opponents were distressed for provisions, and the fleet that was bringing them supplies had been totally <cb /> defeated by the vessels of Brutus. The condition of things, however, was unknown to the latter, and, after an interval of twenty days, he hazarded a second battle. Where he himself fought in person, he was still successful; but the rest of his force was soon overcome, and the conflict ended in a total defeat of the republican army. Escaping with only a few friends, he passed the night in a cave, and, as he saw his cause irretrievably ruined, ordered Strato, one of his attendants, to kill him. Strato refused for a long time to perform the painful office; but, seeing Brutus resolved, he turned away his face, and held his sword while Brutus fell upon it. He died in the forty-third year of his age, B.C. 42.</p>
 <p>A great deal of false glamour has been thrown around the character of Brutus. That he was a stern and consistent patriot throughout the whole of his career, the sketch which we have given of his movements prior to the assassination of Caesar most clearly disproves. Why hold office under one who was trampling upon the liberties of his country? Why require so much solicitation before engaging in the conspiracy? Was he not aware that Caesar was a usurper?—this would show a miserable want of penetration. Or if he preferred security to danger, where was the Roman patriot in this? The truth is that Brutus, notwithstanding all that has been said of him, was but a tardy patriot. His motives towards the close of his career were no doubt pure enough, but he ought to have had nothing to do with Caesar from the moment when that general began to act with treason towards his country. As a student and man of letters, the character of Brutus appears to more advantage than as a patriot. He was remarkable for literary application, usually rising with this view long before day, and it is said that on the evening previous to a battle, while his army was in a state of anxious suspense and alarm, he calmly occupied himself in his tent with writing an abridgment of the history of Polybius. One of the most singular circumstances in the life of Brutus is that of the so-called apparition which, it was said, appeared to him on one occasion in his tent at midnight. “Who art thou?” inquired Brutus. “Thy evil genius,” replied the phantom; “we shall meet again at Philippi.” And so it happened. The spirit reappeared on the eve of the second battle of Philippi—a story that reminds one of the Bodach Glas in <title>Waverley.</title> See Plutarch's life of Brutus.

Plutarch states that the horse had been offered for sale to Philip by a Thessalian, but had proved so unmanageable that the monarch refused to purchase, and ordered it to be taken away. Alexander thereupon expressing his regret that they were losing so fine a horse for want of skill and spirit to manage it, Philip agreed to pay the price of the steed if his son would ride it. The prince accepted the offer, and succeeded in the attempt. Bucephalus, after this, would allow no one but Alexander to mount him, and he accompanied the monarch in all his campaigns. In the battle with Porus, he received, according to the same authority, several wounds, of which he died not long after.

 <p>A famous classical scholar, the most distinguished in the annals of Scottish classical philology. He was born of humble parentage at Killearn, in February, 1506. At the age of fourteen, his uncle sent him to the University of Paris, where he acquired a local reputation for his facility in writing Latin verse. In 1522, he returned to Scotland, and, after serving in a military expedition against the English, matriculated at the University of St. Andrews, from which at the end of one year he received the Bachelor's degree <bibl default="NO">(1525)</bibl>. In 1526, he returned to France, where he soon took the Master's degree at the Scottish College of Paris, and after two years of great destitution succeeded in winning a professorship at the College of Sainte Barbe. In 1535, he once more visited Scotland, having been made tutor to the son of the Earl of Cassilis. Soon after he undertook the education of an illegitimate son of the king (James V.). Having written two satires against the Franciscan clergy (entitled <title>Somnium</title> and <title>Franciscanus</title>), he was imprisoned at the instigation of Cardinal Beaton, but escaping fled to France <bibl default="NO">(1539)</bibl>, and was appointed to a professorship in the College of Bordeaux, by André de Gouvéa, its head. At the end of three years, an outbreak of the <cb /> plague forced him to leave Bordeaux, whence he went to Paris, receiving a professorship in the college of the Cardinal le Moyne. By the influence of De Gouvéa he was called to the newly founded University of Coimbra in Portugal <bibl default="NO">(1547)</bibl>. Here his heretical opinions led to his enforced seclusion in a monastery, where he began his celebrated version of the Psalms in Latin verse. Upon his release he visited England, subsequently returning to France to become tutor to the son of the Maréchal de Brissac <bibl default="NO">(1555)</bibl>. In 1560, he returned to Scotland, which he now made his permanent home. In the struggles between Queen Mary and the Scottish peers, Buchanan bore a prominent part. He had been the classical tutor of the queen, to whom he dedicated his version of the Psalms, but after the death of Darnley, took sides with the faction of the nobles, joining at the same time the Reformed Church. In 1566, the regent, Murray, appointed him Principal of St. Leonard's College in the University of St. Andrews, and soon after Mary's imprisonment in Lochleven, Buchanan was made Moderator of the General Assembly. In 1568, he accompanied Murray to the famous Conference of York. While Lennox was regent, Buchanan assumed charge of the education of the young king, James VI., afterwards James I. of England, who in after-years always spoke of his learned tutor with respect and pride. From 1570 to 1578, Buchanan was Keeper of the Privy Seal, resigning it to devote his time to the preparation of a history of Scotland, which was published a month before his death. This event took place on September 28th, 1582, and was followed by his burial in the Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh.</p>
 <p>As a classicist, Buchanan was best known for his skill in Latin verse, in which he easily ranked first among his contemporaries; and he is generally regarded as the most brilliant of all the British humanists of the sixteenth century. His range of subjects was wide, from versions of the Psalms, theological topics, and political pasquinades, to erotic verses whose indecency may be regarded as purely conventional, though grotesque enough as the production of a professed reformer of religion.</p>
 <p>As a man, Buchanan was stern, strong-willed, and domineering, making many enemies, whom he attacked with a violence of invective that belonged to the customs of the age in which he lived. Besides the works mentioned above, he wrote a violent diatribe against the queen, <title>Detectio Mariae Reginae</title>, and a bold political tract <title>De Iure Regni</title>, in which he states the doctrine that kings exist only by the will of the people and for the people's good.</p>
 <p>His writings were edited in the last century by the elder Burmann. See <bibl default="NO">Irving, <title>Life of George Buchanan</title> (1817)</bibl>.

The first who offended against this last command was a person named Thaulon, who, at the feast of <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Πολιεύς</foreign>, observing a steer eating the sacred <foreign lang="greek">πόπανον</foreign> on the altar, took up an axe and slew the trespasser. The

 expiation-feast (<foreign lang="greek">βουφόνια</foreign>), instituted for the purpose of atoning for this involuntary offence, it was found afterwards expedient to continue. The ceremonies observed in it are not a little amusing. First was brought water by women appointed for the office, for the purpose of sharpening the axe and knife with which the slaughter was to be committed. One of these women having handed the axe to the proper functionary, the latter felled the beast and then took to flight. To slay the beast outright was the office of a third person. All present then partook of the flesh. The meal finished, the hide was stuffed, and the beast, apparently restored to life, was put to the plough. Now commenced the steer-trial. A judicial assembly was held in the Prytaneum, to which all were summoned who had been partakers in the above transaction. Each lays the blame upon the other. The water-bearers throw the guilt upon the sharpener of the axe and knife; the sharpener of the knife casts it upon the person delivering it to the feller of the beast; the feller of the beast upon the actual slaughterer, while this last ascribes the whole guilt to the knife itself. The knife, unable to speak, is found guilty and thrown into the sea.

<head orig="Burmann">Burmann</head>

 <p> The name of two celebrated Dutch classical scholars. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pieter</hi>, known as “the elder,” born at Utrecht, June 26th, 1668. He studied at the university of his native town, from which he received a degree in laws in 1688. He spent some time in travel, visiting the great seats of learning in Germany and Switzerland, and on his return practised law. In 1691, he was appointed receiver of taxes, and in 1696, Professor of Eloquence and History in his Alma Mater. To the duties of this chair he soon added those pertaining <cb /> to the chair of Greek. In 1715, he was called to the University of Leyden to succeed the renowned Perizonius (q. v.) as Professor of Greek, Rhetoric, and History, where he remained until his death, which occurred March 31st, 1741. He was an indefatigable editor, producing commentaries on  Phaedrus<bibl default="NO">(1698)</bibl>, Horace <bibl default="NO">(1699)</bibl>, Valerius Flaccus <bibl default="NO">(1701)</bibl>, Petronius <bibl default="NO">(1709)</bibl>, Velleius Paterculus <bibl default="NO">(1719)</bibl>, Quintilian <bibl default="NO">(1720)</bibl>, Ovid <bibl default="NO">(1727)</bibl>, and Lucan <bibl default="NO">(1740)</bibl>. He likewise edited the works of the Scottish scholar, George <ref type="cross" target="crossbuchanan">Buchanan</ref> (q.v.), and continued the <seg lang="la">magnum opus</seg> of Graevius, <title>Thesaurus Antiquitatum et Historiarum Italiae</title>, besides preparing a short manual of Roman Antiquities entitled <bibl default="NO"><title>Antiquitatum Romanarum Brevis Descriptio</title> (1711)</bibl>. A number of his poems and orations in Latin were collected and published after his death. As a commentator, Burmann was diffuse, laborious, and pedantic, and his stately quartos are to-day but little consulted; yet they have furnished much material for succeeding editors who possessed the taste and discretion which he unfortunately lacked. As a controversialist, he possessed a most irascible temper, and was involved in many violent disputes with contemporary scholars, notably with Le Clerc and Bentley.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pieter</hi>, known as “the younger,” the nephew of the preceding, was born at Amsterdam in 1714, and after studying at Utrecht, filled professorships at Franeker and at the Amsterdam Athenaeum, besides acting as the keeper of the public library at the latter place. His published works comprise editions of Aristophanes, Vergil, Claudian, and Propertius, besides a selection of the Latin Anthology <bibl default="NO">(1759 and 1773)</bibl>. In 1777, he retired on a pension and died in the following year. The Anthology is his only work that is now regarded as important. See L. Müller, <bibl default="NO"><title>Geschichte der class.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βούσιρις</foreign>). (1) A reputed king of Egypt, son of Poseidon and Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphus, or (as Plutarch states, from the Samian Agatho ) of Poseidon and Anippé, daughter of the Nile. This king, in consequence of an oracle, offered up strangers on the altar of Zeus; for Egypt having been afflicted with a dearth for nine years, a native of Cyprus named Thrasius, a great soothsayer, came thither, and said that it would cease if they sacrificed a stranger every year to Zeus. Busiris sacrificed the prophet himself first of all, and then continued the practice. When Heracles, in the course of his wanderings, came into Egypt, he was seized and dragged to the altar; but he burst his bonds, and slew Busiris, his son Amphidamas, and his herald Chalbes. Historically, there is no such king as Busiris, and the myth is in all probability only a legend of the former sacrifice of human victims to <ref type="cross" target="crossosiris">Osiris</ref> (q.v.), of which name Busiris is only a corruption.</p>

<div2 id="crossbutyrum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Butyrum">Butyrum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βούτυρον</foreign>). Butter. The oldest mention of butter, though dubious and obscure, is in the account given of the Scythians by Herodotus (iv. 2). According to him they poured the milk of mares into wooden vessels, caused it to be violently stirred or shaken by their blind slaves, and thus separated the part that arose to the surface, which they considered more valuable and more delicious than that which was collected below it. Herodotus here evidently speaks of the richest part of the milk being separated from the rest by shaking; and that what he alludes to here was actually butter would plainly appear from comparing with what he says the much clearer account of his contemporary Hippocrates. “The Scythians,” remarks this latter writer, “pour the milk of their mares into wooden vessels, and shake it violently; this causes it to foam, and the fat part, which is light, rising to the surface, becomes what is called butter (<foreign lang="greek">ὃ βούτυρον καλοῦσι</foreign>).” Mention of butter occurs several times, in fact, in the writings of Hippocrates, and he prescribes it externally as a medicine; though he gives it another name, <hi rend="italic">pikerion</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">πικέριον</foreign>).</p>
 <p>It would appear, however, that butter must have been very little known to the Greeks and Romans till the end of the second century. It appears, also, that when they had learned the art of making it, they employed it only as an ointment in their baths, and particularly in medicine. Pliny recommends it, mixed with honey, to be rubbed over children's gums, in order to ease the pain of teething, and also for ulcers in the mouth. The Romans, in general, seem to have used butter for anointing the bodies of their children to render them pliable; and we are told that the ancient Burgundians smeared their hair with it. Except in Dioscorides there is no indication that it was used by the Greeks or Romans in cookery or the preparation of food. No notice is taken of it by Apicius, nor is it mentioned by Galen for any other than medical purposes. This is easily accounted for by the ancients having entirely accustomed themselves to the use of oil; and, in like manner, butter at present is very little employed in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the southern parts of France. One chief cause of this is the difficulty of preserving it for any length of time in warm countries, and it would seem that among the ancients in the south of Europe it was rather in an oily state and almost liquid.

<head orig="Byzantīnum Imperium">Byzantinum Imperium</head>

 <p> The Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire, comprehending at first, in Asia, the country on this side of the Euphrates, the coasts of the Black Sea, and Asia Minor; in Africa, Egypt; and in Europe, all the countries from the Hellespont to the Adriatic and Danube. This survived the Western Empire 1000 years, and was even increased by the addition of Italy and the coasts of the Mediterranean. It commenced in 395, when Theodosius divided the Roman Empire between his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius. The Eastern Empire fell to the elder, Arcadius, through whose weakness it suffered many misfortunes. During his minority Rufinus was his guardian and minister, between whom and Stilicho, the minister of the Western Empire, a fierce rivalry existed. The Goths laid waste Greece; Eutropius, the successor, and Gainas, the murderer of Rufinus, were ruined by their own crimes. The latter lost his life in a civil war excited by him (A.D. 400). Arcadius and his Empire were now ruled by his proud and covetous wife, Eudoxia, till her death (A.D. 404). The Isaurians and the Huns wasted the provinces of Asia and the country along the Danube.

</figure> <cb /> of his sister Pulcheria. Naturally of an inferior mind, his education had made him entirely imbecile, and unfit for self-command. Pulcheria, who bore the title of Augusta, administered the kingdom ably. Of the Western Empire, which had been ceded to Valentinian, Theodosius retained western Illyria. The Greeks fought with success against the king of the Persians, Varanes. The kingdom of Armenia, thrown into confusion by internal dissensions, and claimed at the same time by the Romans and the Persians, became now an apple of contention between the two nations (A.D. 440). <ref type="cross" target="crossattila">Attila</ref> (q.v.) laid waste the dominions of Theodosius, and obliged him to pay tribute. After the death of her brother, Pulcheria was acknowledged empress (A.D. 450), being the first woman who attained this dignity. She gave her hand to the senator Marcian, and raised him to the throne. His wisdom and valour averted the attacks of the Huns from the frontiers, but he did not support the Western Empire in its wars against the Huns and Vandals with sufficient energy. He afforded shelter to a part of the Germans and Sarmatians, who were driven to the Roman frontiers by the incursions of the Huns. Pulcheria died before him, in 453. Leo I. (A.D. 457), a prince praised by contemporary authors, was chosen successor of His expeditions against the Vandals (A.D. 467) were unsuccessful. His grandson Leo would have succeeded him, but died a minor shortly after him, having named his father, Zeno, his colleague (A.D. 474). The government of this weak emperor, who was hated by his subjects, was disturbed by rebellions and internal disorders of the Empire. The Goths depopulated their provinces till their king, Theodoric, turned his arms against Italy (A.D. 489). Ariadné, widow of Zeno, raised the minister Anastasius, whom she married, to the throne (A.D. 491). The nation, once excited to discontents and tumults, could not be entirely appeased by the alleviation of their burdens and by wise decrees. The forces of the Empire, being thus weakened, could not offer an effectual resistance to the Persians and the barbarians along the Danube. To prevent their incursions into the peninsula of Constantinople, Anastasius built the Long Wall, as it is called. After the death of Anastasius the soldiers proclaimed Justin emperor (A.D. 518). Notwithstanding his low birth, he maintained possession of the throne. Religious persecutions, which he undertook at the instigation of the clergy, and various crimes into which he was seduced by his nephew Justinian, disgrace his reign. After his early death, in 521, he was succeeded by the same Justinian, to whom, though he deserves not the name of the Great, many virtues of a ruler cannot be denied. He was renowned as a legislator, and his reign was distinguished by the victories of his general Belisarius; but how unable he was to revive the strength of his Empire was proved by its rapid decay after his death. Justin II., his successor (A.D. 565), was an avaricious, cruel, weak prince, governed by his wife. The Lombards tore from him part of Italy (A.D. 568). His war with Persia, for the possession of Armenia, was unsuccessful; the Avari plundered the provinces on the Danube, and the violence of his grief at these misfortunes deprived him of reason. Tiberius, his minister, a man of merit, was declared Caesar, and the general Justinian conducted the war against 
<pb n="232" /><cb /> Persia with success. The Greeks now allied themselves, for the first time, with the Turks. Against his successor, Tiberius II. (A.D. 578), the empress Sophia and the general Justinian conspired in vain. From the Avari the emperor purchased peace; from the Persians it was extorted by his general Mauritius or Maurice (A.D. 582). This commander Tiberius declared Caesar in the same year. Mauritius, under other circumstances, would have made an excellent monarch, but for the times he wanted prudence and resolution. He was indebted for the tranquillity of the eastern frontiers to the gratitude of King Chosroës II., whom, in 591, he restored to the throne from which he had been deposed by his subjects. Nevertheless, the war against the Avari was unsuccessful, through the errors of Commentiolus. The army was discontented and irritated, now by untimely severity and parsimony and now by timid indulgence. It finally proclaimed Phocas, one of its officers, emperor. Mauritius was taken in his flight and put to death (A.D. 602). The vices of Phocas and his incapacity for government produced the greatest disorders in the Empire. Heraclius, son of the governor of Africa, took up arms, conquered Constantinople, and caused Phocas to be executed (A.D. 610). He distinguished himself only in the short period of the Persian War. During the first twelve years of his reign the Avari, and other nations of the Danube, plundered the European provinces, and the Persians conquered the coasts of Syria and Egypt. Having finally succeeded in pacifying the Avari, he marched against the Persians (A.D. 622), and defeated them; but during this time the Avari, who had renewed the war, made an unsuccessful attack on Constantinople in 626. Taking advantage of an insurrection of the subjects of Chosroës, he penetrated into the centre of Persia. By the peace concluded with Siroës (A.D. 628) he recovered the lost provinces and the Holy Cross. But the Arabs, who, meanwhile, had become powerful under Mohammed and the califs, conquered Phoenicia, the countries on the Euphrates, Iudaea, Syria, and all Egypt (A.D. 631-641). Among his descendants there was not one able prince. He was succeeded by his son Constantine III., probably in conjunction with his step-brother Heracleonas. The former soon died, and the latter lost his crown and was mutilated. After him, Constans, son of Constantine, obtained the throne (A.D. 642). His sanguinary spirit of persecution and the murder of his brother Theodosius made him odious to the nation. The Arabs, pursuing their conquests, took from him part of Africa, Cyprus, and Rhodes, and defeated him at sea (A.D. 653). Internal disturbances obliged him to make peace. After this he left Constantinople (A.D. 659), and in the following year carried on an unsuccessful war against the Lombards in Italy, in which he lost his life at Syracuse (A.D. 660). Constantine IV., Pogonatus, son of Constans, vanquished his Syracusan competitor Mezizius, and in the beginning of his reign shared the government with his brothers Tiberius and Heraclius. The Arabs inundated all Africa and Sicily, penetrated through Asia Minor into Thrace, and attacked Constantinople for several successive years by sea (A.D. 669). Nevertheless, he made peace with them on favourable terms. But, on the other hand, the Bulgarians obliged him to pay a tribute (A.D. 680). Justinian II., <cb /> his son and successor, weakened the power of the Maronites, but fought without success against the Bulgarians and Arabs. Leonitius dethroned this cruel prince, had him mutilated, and sent to the Tauric Chersonese (A.D. 695). Leonitius was dethroned by Apsimar, or Tiberius III. (A.D. 698), who was himself dethroned by Trebelius, king of the Bulgarians, who restored Justinian to the throne (A.D. 705); but Philippicus Bardanes rebelled anew against him. With Justinian II. the race of Heraclius was extinguished. The only care of Philippicus was the spreading of Monotheism, while the Arabs wasted Asia Minor and Thrace. In opposition to this prince, who was universally hated, the different armies proclaimed their leaders emperors, among whom Leo III., the Isaurian, obtained the hegemony (A.D. 713-714). Leo repelled the Arabs from Constantinople, which <figure id="fig.00232">
<head orig="Gold Coin of Leo III. (British Museum.)">Gold Coin of Leo III. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> they had attacked for almost two years, and suppressed the rebellion excited by Basilius and the former emperor Anastasius. From 726 the abolition of the worship of images absorbed his attention, and the Italian provinces were allowed to become a prey to the Lombards, while the Arabs plundered the Eastern provinces. After his death (A.D. 741) his son Constantine V. ascended the throne, a courageous, active, and noble prince. He vanquished his rebellious brother-in-law Artabasdus, wrested from the Arabs part of Syria and Armenia, and overcame at last the Bulgarians, against whom he had been long unsuccessful. He died (A.D. 775), and was succeeded by his son Leo IV., who fought successfully against the Arabs; and this latter, by his son Constantine VI., whose imperious mother Irené, his guardian and associate in the government, raised a powerful party by the restoration of the worship of images. He endeavoured in vain to free himself from dependence on her and her favourite Stauratius, and died in 797, after having had his eyes put out. <figure id="fig.00232.2">

</figure> The war against the Arabs and Bulgarians was long continued; against the former it was unsuccessful. The design of the empress to marry Charlemagne excited the discontent of the patricians, who placed one of their own order, Nicephorus, upon the throne (A.D. 802). Irené died in a monastery. Nicephorus became tributary to the Arabs, and fell in the war against the Bulgarians (A.D. 811). Stauratius, his son, was deprived of the crown by Michael I., and he in turn by Leo V. (A.D. 813). Leo was dethroned and put to 
<pb n="233" /><cb />
 death by Michael II. (A.D. 820). During the reign of the latter the Arabs conquered Sicily, Lower Italy, Crete, and other countries. Michael prohibited the worship of images, as did also his son Theophilus. Theodora, guardian of his son Michael III., put a stop to the dispute about images (A.D. 841). During a cruel persecution of the Manichaeans, the Arabs devastated the Asiatic provinces. The dissolute and extravagant Michael confined his mother in a monastery. The government was administered in his name by Bardas, his uncle, and after the death of Bardas by Basil, who was put to death by Michael (A.D. 867). Basil I., who came to the throne in 867, was <figure id="fig.00233">

</figure> not altogether a contemptible monarch. He died A.D. 886. The reign of his learned son, Leo VI., was not very happy. He died A.D. 911. His son, Constantine VII., Porphyrogenitus, a minor when he succeeded his father, was placed under the guardianship of his colleague Alexander, and after Alexander's death, in 912, under that of his mother Zoé. Romanus Lacopenus, his general, obliged him, in 919, to share the throne with him and his children. Constantine subsequently took sole possession of it again, and reigned mildly but weakly. His son Romanus II. succeeded him in 959, and fought successfully against the Arabs. To him succeeded, in 963, his general Nicephorus, who was put to death by his own general, John Zimisces (A.D. 970), who carried on a successful war against the Russians. Basil II., son of Romanus, succeeded this able prince. He vanquished <figure id="fig.00233.2">

Romanus III. became emperor <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1028)</bibl> by a marriage with Zoé, daughter of Constantine. This dissolute but able princess caused her husband to be executed, and successively raised to the throne Michael IV. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1034)</bibl>, Michael V. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1041)</bibl>, and Constantine X. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1042)</bibl>.

Her successor, Michael VI. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1056)</bibl>, was dethroned by Isaac Comnenus in 1057, who became a monk <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1059)</bibl>. His successor, Constantine XI., Ducas, fought successfully against the Uzes. Eudocia, his wife, guardian of his sons Michael, Andronicus, and Constantine, was intrusted with the administration <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1067)</bibl>, married Romanus IV., and brought him the crown. He carried on an unsuccessful war against the Turks, who kept him for some time prisoner. Michael VII., son of Constantine, deprived him of the throne <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1071)</bibl>. Michael was dethroned by Nicephorus III. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1078)</bibl>, and the latter by Alexius I., Comnenus <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1081)</bibl>. Under his reign the crusades commenced. His son, John II., came to the throne in 1118, and fought with great success against the Turks and other barbarians. The reign of his son Manuel I., who succeeded him in 1143, was also not unfortunate. His son, Alexius II., succeeded <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1180)</bibl>, and was dethroned by his guardian Andronicus, as was the latter by Isaac <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1185)</bibl>. After a reign disturbed from without and within, Isaac was dethroned by his brother, Alexius III. <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1195)</bibl>. The crusaders restored him and his son Alexius IV., but the seditious Constantinopolitans proclaimed Alexius V., Ducas Murzuphlus, emperor, who put Alexius IV. to death. At the same time Isaac II. died. During the last reigns, the kings of Sicily had made many conquests on the coasts of the Adriatic. The Latins now forced their way to Constantinople <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1204)</bibl>, conquered the city, and retained it, together with most of the European territories of the Empire. Baldwin, count of Flanders, was made emperor; Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, obtained Thessalonica as a kingdom, and the Venetians acquired a large extent of territory. In Rhodes, Philadelphia, Corinth, and Epirus, independent sovereigns arose. Theodore Lascaris seized on the Asiatic provinces, bore the title of emperor at Nice, and was, at first, more powerful than Baldwin. A descendant of the Comneni, named Alexius, established a principality at Trebisond, in which his great-grandson John took the title of emperor. Neither Baldwin nor his successors were able to secure the tottering throne. He himself died in captivity among the Bulgarians <bibl default="NO">(1206)</bibl>. To him succeeded Henry, his brother, with Peter, brother-in-law of Henry, and his son Robert <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1221)</bibl>. With the exception of Constantinople, all the remaining Byzantine territory, including Thessalonica, was conquered by John, emperor of Nice. Baldwin II., brother of Robert, under the guardianship of his colleague, John Brienne, king of Jerusalem, died in 1237. Michael Palaeologus, king of Nice, conquered Constantinople in 1261, and Baldwin died in the West a private person. The sovereigns of Nice, up to this period, were Theodore Lascaris <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1204)</bibl>; John Ducas Patatzes, a good monarch and successful warrior <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1222)</bibl>; Theodore II., his 
<pb n="234" /><cb />
 son <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1259)</bibl>, who was deprived of the crown by Michael Palaeologus <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1260)</bibl>. In 1261, Michael took Constantinople from the Latins. He laboured to unite himself with the Latin Church, but his son Andronicus renounced the connection. Internal disturbances and foreign wars, particularly with the Turks, threw the exhausted Empire into confusion. Andronicus III., his grandson, obliged him to divide the throne <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1322)</bibl>, and at length wrested it entirely from him. Andronicus died a monk <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1328)</bibl>. Andronicus IV., who ascended the throne in the same year, waged war unsuccessfully against the Turks, and died A.D. 1341. His son John was obliged to share the throne with his guardian, John Cantacuzenus, during ten years. The son of the latter, Matthew, was also made emperor, but John Cantacuzenus resigned the crown, and Matthew was compelled to abdicate <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1355)</bibl>. Under the reign of John, the Turks first obtained a firm footing in Europe, and conquered Gallipolis <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1357)</bibl>. The family of Palaeologus, from this time, were gradually deprived of their European territories, partly by revolt and partly by the Turks. The Sultan Amurath took Adrianople A.D. 1361. Bajazet conquered almost all the European provinces except Constantinople, and obliged John to pay him tribute. The latter was, some time after, driven out by his own son Manuel <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1391)</bibl>. Bajazet besieged Constantinople, defeated an army of Western warriors under Sigismund, near Nicopolis, and Manuel was obliged to place John, son of Andronicus, on his throne. Timour's invasion of the Turkish provinces saved Constantinople for this time <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1402)</bibl>. Manuel then recovered his throne, and regained some of the lost provinces from the contending sons of Bajazet. To him succeeded his son John <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1425)</bibl>, whom Amurath II. stripped of all his territories except Constantinople, and extorted from him a tribute <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1444)</bibl>. To the emperor John succeeded his brother Constantine. With the assistance of his general, the Genoese Justinian, he withstood the superior forces of the enemy with fruitless courage, and fell in the defence of Constantinople, by the conquest of which, May 29th, A.D. 1453, Mohammed II. put an end to the Greek or Byzantine Empire.</p>
 <p>The events which have just been detailed are recorded by a series of Greek authors, known by the general name of Byzantine historians. Their works relate to the history of the lower Empire, from the fourth century to the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks, and to the Turkish history for some period later. They display in their writings the faults of a degenerate age, but are valuable for the information which they furnish, being the principal source from which we obtain the history of the decay of the Eastern Empire. The most valuable of the number are Zonaras, Nicetas, Nicephorus, and Chalcondylas. These four form a continued history of the Byzantine Empire to the year 1470. Of the remaining authors, who give us histories of detached portions of this same period, the following deserve particular mention, and are given in chronological <cb /> order: (1) Procopins (q. v.);</p>

<head orig="Byzantium">Byzantium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Βυζάντιον</foreign>). A celebrated city of Thrace, on the shore of the Thracian Bosporus, called at a later period <ref type="cross" target="crossconstantinopolis">Constantinopolis</ref>, and made the capital of the Eastern Empire of the Romans. It was founded by a Dorian colony from Megara, or, rather, by a Megarian colony in conjunction with a Thracian prince. For Byzas, whom the city acknowledged, and celebrated in a festival as its founder, was, according to the legend, a son of Poseidon and Ceroëssa the daughter of Io, and ruled over all the adjacent country. The early commerce of Megara was directed principally to the shores of the Propontis, and this people had founded Chalcedon seventeen years before Byzantium, and Selymbria even prior to Chalcedon ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 144" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 144</bibl>). When, however, their trade was extended still farther to the north, and had reached the shores of the Euxine, the harbour of Chalcedon sank in importance, and a commercial station was required on the opposite side of the strait. This station was Byzantium. The appellation of “blind men” given to the Chalcedonians by the Persian general Megabazus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 144" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 144</bibl>), for having overlooked the superior site where Byzantium was afterwards founded, does not therefore appear to <figure id="fig.00234">
<head orig="Map of Byzantium, or Constantinople.">Map of Byzantium, or Constantinople.</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="235" /><cb />
 have been well merited. As long as Chalcedon was the northernmost point reached by the commerce of Megara, its situation was preferable to any offered by the opposite side of the Bosporus, because the current on this latter side runs down from the north more strongly than it does on the side of Chalcedon, and the harbour of this city, therefore, is more accessible to vessels coming from the south. On the other hand, Byzantium was far superior to Chalcedon for the northern trade, since the current that set in strongly from the Euxine carried vessels directly into the harbour of Byzantium, but prevented their approach to Chalcedon in a straight course (Polyb. iv. 43). The harbour of Byzantium was peculiarly favoured by nature, being deep, capacious, and sheltered from every storm. From its shape, and the rich advantages thus connected with it, the harbour of Byzantium obtained the name of Chrysoceras, or “the Golden Horn,” which was also applied to the promontory or neck of land that contributed to form it. And yet, notwithstanding all these advantages, Byzantium remained for a long time an inconsiderable town. The declining commerce of Megara, and the character which Byzantium still sustained of being a half-barbarian place, may serve to account for this.</p>
 <p>At a subsequent period, the Milesians sent hither a strong colony, and so altered for the better the aspect of things that they are regarded by some ancient writers as the founders of the city itself. When, at a later day, the insurrection of the Asiatic Greeks had been crushed by Darius, and the Persian fleet was reducing to obedience the Greek cities along the Hellespont and the Propontis, the Byzantines, together with a body of Chalcedonians, would not wait for the coming of the Persians, but, leaving their habitations, and fleeing to the Euxine, built the city of Mesembria on the upper coast of Thrace ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 33</bibl>). The Persians destroyed the empty city, and no Byzantium for some time thereafter existed. This will explain why Seylax, in his <title>Periplus</title>, passed by Byzantium in silence, while he mentions all the Grecian settlements in this quarter, and among them even Mesembria itself.</p>
 <p>Byzantium reappeared after the overthrow of Xerxes, some of the old inhabitants having probably returned; and here Pausanias, the commander of the Grecian forces, took up his quarters (B.C. 479). He gave the city a code of laws, and a government modelled, in some degree, after the Spartan form, and hence he was regarded by some as the true founder of the city. The Athenians succeeding to the hegemony, Byzantium fell under their control, and received so many important additions from them that Ammianus Marcellinus, in a later age, calls it an Attic colony (xxii. 8). The city, however, was a Doric one, in language, customs, and laws, and remained so even after the Athenians had the control of it. The maintenance of this military post became of great importance to the Greeks during their warfare with the Persians in subsequent years, and this circumstance, together with the advantages of a lucrative and now continually increasing commerce, gave Byzantium a high rank among Grecian cities. After Athens and Sparta had weakened the power of each other by national rivalry, and neither could lay claim to the empire of the sea, Byzantium became an independent city, and turned <cb /> its whole attention to commerce. Its strong situation enabled it, at a subsequent period, to resist successfully the arms of Philip of Macedon; nor did Alexander, in his eagerness to march into Asia, make any attempt upon the place. It preserved also a neutral character under his successors. The great evil to which the city of Byzantium was exposed came from the inland country, the Thracian tribes continually making incursions into the fertile territory around the place, and carrying off more or less of the products of the fields. The city suffered severely also from the Gauls, being compelled to pay a yearly tribute amounting at least to eighty talents.</p>
 <p>After the departure of the Gauls it again became a flourishing place, but its most prosperous period was during the Roman sway. It had thrown itself into the arms of the Romans as early as the war against the younger Philip of Macedon, and enjoyed from that people not only complete protection, but also many valuable commercial privileges. It was allowed, more<figure id="fig.00235">
<head orig="Coin of Byzantium.">Coin of Byzantium.</head>
</figure> over, to lay a toll on all vessels passing through the straits—a thing which had been attempted before without success—and this toll it shared with the Romans. But the day of misfortune at length came. In the contest for the Empire between Severus and Niger, Byzantium declared for the latter, and stood a siege in consequence which continued long after Niger's overthrow and death. After three years of almost incredible exertions the place surrendered to Severus. The few remaining inhabitants whom famine had spared were sold as slaves, the city was razed to the ground, its territory given to Perinthus, and a small village took the place of the great commercial emporium. Repenting soon after of what he had done, Severus rebuilt Byzantium, and adorned it with numerous and splendid buildings, which in a later age still bore his name; but it never recovered its former rank until the days of Constantine. Constantine had no great affection for Rome as a city, nor had the inhabitants any great regard for him. He felt the necessity, moreover, of having the capital of the Empire in some more central quarter, from which the movements of the German tribes on the one hand, and those of the Persians on the other, might be observed. He long sought for such a locality, and believed at one time that he had found it in the neighbourhood of the Sigaean promontory, on the coast of Troas. He had even commenced building here when the superior advantages of Byzantium as a centre of empire attracted his attention, and he finally resolved to make this the capital of the Roman world. For a monarchy possessing the western portion of Asia and the largest part of Europe, together with the whole coast of the Mediterranean Sea, nature herself seemed to have destined Byzantium as a capital.</p>
 <p>Constantine's plan was carried into rapid execution (A.D. 330). The ancient city had possessed a circuit 
<pb n="236" /><cb />
 of forty stadia, and covered merely two hills, one close to the water, on which the Seraglio at present stands, and another adjoining it, and extending towards the interior to what is now the <title>Besestan</title>, or great market. The new city, called Constantinopolis, or “City of Constantine,” was three times as large, and covered four hills, together with part of a fifth, having a circuit of somewhat less than fourteen geo<figure id="fig.00236">
<head orig="St. Sophia, at Constantinople.">St. Sophia, at Constantinople.</head>
</figure> graphical miles. Every effort was made to embellish this new capital of the Roman world: the most splendid edifices were erected, including an imperial palace, numerous residences for the chief officers of the court, churches, baths, a hippodrome; and inhabitants were procured from every quarter. Its rapid increase called, from time to time, for a corresponding enlargement of the city, until, in the <cb /> reign of Theodosius II., when the new walls were erected (the previous ones having been thrown down by an earthquake), Constantinople attained to the size which it at present has. Chalcondylas supposes the walls of the city to be 111 stadia in circumference; Gyllius, about 13 Italian miles; but, according to the best modern plans of Constantinople, it is not less than 19,700 yards. The number of gates is twentyeight—fourteen on the side of the port, seven towards the land, and as many on the Propontis. The city is built on a triangular promontory, and the number of hills which it covers is seven. Besides the name of Constantinopolis (<foreign lang="greek">Κωνσταντίνου πόλις</foreign>), this city had also the more imposing one of New Rome (<foreign lang="greek">Νέα Ῥώμη</foreign>), which, however, gradually fell into disuse. According to some, the peasants in the neighbourhood, while they repair to Constantinople, say in corrupt Greek that they are going <seg lang="la">es tam bolin</seg> (i.e. <foreign lang="greek">ἐς τὰν πόλιν</foreign>), “to the city,” whence has arisen the Turkish name of the place, Stamboul. Constantinople was taken by the Turks under Mohammed II. on the 29th of May, A.D. 1453.
