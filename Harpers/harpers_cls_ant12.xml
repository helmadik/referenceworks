<head orig="Labărum">Labarum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λάβαρον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λάβουρον</foreign>). The sacred banner or standard borne before the Roman emperors in war from the time of Constantine. It is described as a long pike intersected by a transverse beam. A silken veil, of a purple colour, hung down from the beam, and was adorned with precious stones, and curiously inwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his children. The summit of the pike supported a crown of gold, which enclosed the monogram at once expressive of the figure of the cross, and the two initial letters (X and P) of the name of Christ. The safety of the Labarum was intrusted to fifty <cb /> guards of approved valour and fidelity. In the Second Civil War, Licinius felt the power of this consecrated banner, the sight of which, in the stress of battle, animated the soldiers of Constantine with an invincible enthusiasm, and scattered terror and dismay through the adverse legions. Eusebius (<title>Vit. Const.</title> i. 2, 7 foll.) introduces the Labarum before the Italian expedition of Constantine; but his narrative seems to indicate that it was never shown at the head of an army till Constantine, about ten years afterwards, declared himself the enemy of Licinius and the deliverer of the Church. The Christian emperors, who re<figure id="fig.00911">
<head orig="Labarum.">Labarum.</head>
</figure> spected the example of Constantine, displayed in all their military expeditions the standard of the cross; but when the successors of Theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies, the Labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the palace of Constantinople. Its form is still preserved on the medals of the Flavian family; and there is extant a medal of the emperor Constantius, where the standard of the Labarum is accompanied with these memorable words: “By this sign thou shalt conquer.”</p>
 <p>The history of this standard is a curious one. A contemporary writer (Caecilius) affirms that in the night which preceded the last battle against Maxentius (A.D. 312), Constantine was admonished in a dream to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the “celestial sign of God,” the sacred monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the command, and that his obedience was rewarded by a decisive victory at the Milvian bridge. The dream of Constantine may be naturally explained either by the enthusiasm or the policy of the emperor. While his anxiety for the approaching day, which must decide the fate of the Empire, was suspended 
<pb n="912" /><cb />
 by a short and interrupted slumber, the revered form of the Saviour and the well-known symbol of his religion might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced the name, and had, perhaps, secretly implored the power of the God of the Christians. As readily, on the other hand, might a consummate statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military stratagems, one of those pious frauds, which Philip and Sertorius had employed with such art and effect.</p>
 <p>The account given by Eusebius , however, is different from this. According to his statement, Constantine is reported to have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the cross placed above the meridian sun, and inscribed with the following words in Greek: <foreign lang="greek">Ἐν τούτῳ νίκα</foreign>. This appearance in the sky astonished the whole army, as well as the emperor himself, who was yet undetermined in the choice of a religion; but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision of the ensuing night. The Saviour appeared before his eyes, and displayed the same celestial sign of the cross, directing Constantine to frame a similar standard, and to march, with an assurance of victory, against Maxentius and all his enemies.</p>
 <p>The form of the Labarum and monogram may be seen, as we have already said, on the medals of the Flavian family. The etymology of the term itself has given rise to many conflicting opinions. Some derive the name from <seg lang="la">labor;</seg> others from <foreign lang="greek">εὐλάβεια</foreign>, “reverence”; others from <foreign lang="greek">λαμβάνειν</foreign>, “to take”; and others, again, from <foreign lang="greek">λάφυρα</foreign>, “spoils.” One writer makes Labarum to be like S.P.Q.R., only a <seg lang="la">notatio</seg>, or combination of initials to represent an equal number of terms; and thus, L.A.B.A.R.V.M. will stand for <title>Legionum aquila Byzantium antiqua Roma urbe mutavit.</title>

<div2 id="crosslaberius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Laberius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Decĭmus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman knight of good family, born about B.C. 107. He was famed for his talent in writing mimes, in the composition of which productions he occasionally amused himself. He was at length requested by Iulius Caesar, in B.C. 45, to appear on the stage and act the mimes which he had written (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 7" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 7</bibl>). Laberius was sixty years of age when this occurrence took place. Aware that the entreaties of a dictator were equivalent to commands, he complied; but, in the prologue to the first piece which he acted, he complained bitterly to the audience of the degradation to which he had been subjected. The whole prologue, consisting of twenty-nine lines, which have been preserved by Macrobius, is written in a lofty vein and with all the high spirit of a Roman citizen. He is said to have represented the feigned character with inimitable grace and spirit; yet in the course of the performance he could not refrain from expressing strong sentiments of freedom and detestation of tyranny. In one of the scenes he personated a Syrian slave; and, while escaping from the lash of his master, he exclaimed, <lb />“Porro, Quirites, libertatem perdidimus;”</p>
 <p>and shortly after he added, <lb />“Necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent,”</p>
 <p>on which the whole audience turned their eyes towards Caesar, who was present in the theatre (Macrob. l. c.). It was not merely to entertain the people, who would have been as well amused with the representation of any other actor; nor to wound the private feeling of Laberius that Caesar forced him on the stage. His sole object was to degrade the Roman knighthood, to subdue their spirit of independence, and to strike the people with a sense of his unlimited sway. This policy formed part of the same system which afterwards led him to persuade a senator to fight in the ranks of the gladiators. Though Laberius complied with the wishes of Caesar in exhibiting himself on the stage, and acquitted himself with ability as a mimetic actor, it would appear that the dictator had been hurt and offended by the freedoms which he used in the course of the representation, and, either on this or some subsequent occasion, bestowed the dramatic crown on Publilius Syrus in preference to the Roman knight. Laberius submitted with good grace to this fresh humiliation; he pretended to regard it merely as the ordinary chance of theatric competition. He did not long survive, however, this double mortification, but retired from Rome, and died at Puteoli about ten months after the assassination of Caesar. The titles and fragments of forty-three of the mimes of Laberius are still extant; but, excepting the prologue already cited, none is important. They will be found collected in Ribbeck's <title>Comicorum Romanorum Fragmenta</title>, pp. 279-302 <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1873)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosslabyrinthus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Labyrinthus">Labyrinthus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λαβύρινθος</foreign>). A name given to a species of structure full of intricate passages and windings, so that when once entered, it is next to impossible for an individual to extricate himself without the assistance of a guide. The origin of the term will be considered at the close of the article. There were four very famous labyrinths among the ancients—one in Egypt near the Lake Moeris, another in Crete, a third at Lemnos, and a fourth near Clusium in Italy. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Egyptian</hi>. This was situated in Lower Egypt, near Lake Moeris, and in the vicinity of Arsinoë or Crocodilopolis. The accounts which the ancient writers give of it are very different from each other. Herodotus, who saw the structure itself, assigns to it twelve courts ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 148" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 148</bibl>). Pliny , whose description <cb /> is much more highly coloured and marvellous than the former's, makes the number sixteen ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 19</bibl>); while Strabo, who, like Herodotus, beheld the very structure, gives the number of courts as twenty-seven. The following imperfect sketch, drawn from these different sources, may give some idea of the magnitude and nature of this singular structure: A large edifice, divided, most probably, into twelve separate palaces, stretched along with a succession of splendid apartments, spacious halls, etc., the whole adorned with columns, gigantic statues, richly carved hieroglyphics, and every other appendage of Egyptian art. With the northern side of the structure were connected six courts, and the same number with the southern. These were open places surrounded by lofty walls, and paved with large slabs of stone. Around these courts ran a vast number of the most intricate passages, lower than the corresponding parts of the main building; and around all these again was thrown a large wall, affording only one entrance into the Labyrinth; while at the other end, where the Labyrinth terminated, was a pyramid forty fathoms high, with large figures carved on it, and a subterraneous way leading within. According to Herodotus, the whole structure contained 3000 chambers, 1500 above ground, and as many below. The historian informs us that he went through all the rooms above the surface of the earth, but that he was not allowed by the Egyptians who kept the place to examine the subterraneous apartments, because in these were the bodies of the sacred crocodiles and of the kings who had built the Labyrinth. “The upper part, however,” remarks the historian, “which I carefully viewed, seems to surpass the art of men; for the passages through the buildings and the variety of windings afforded me a thousand occasions of wonder, as I passed from a hall to a chamber, and from the chamber to other buildings, and from chambers into halls. All the roofs and walls within are of stone, but the walls are further adorned with figures of sculpture. The halls are surrounded with pillars of white stone, very closely fitted.”</p>
 <p>According to Herodotus, the Labyrinth was built by twelve kings, who at one time reigned over Egypt, and it was intended as a public monument of their common reign ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 148" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 148</bibl>). Others make it to have been constructed by Psammetichus alone, who was one of the twelve; others again, by Ismandes or Petosuchis. Mannert assigns it to Memnon. Opinions are also divided as to the object of this singular structure. Some regard it as a burial-place for the kings and sacred crocodiles, an opinion very prevalent among the ancients. Others view it as a kind of Egyptian Pantheon. Others, again, make it to have been a place of assembly for the deputies sent by each of the twelve nomes of Egypt; while another class think that the Egyptian Mysteries were celebrated here. According to Galterer, however, the Labyrinth was an architectural symbolical representation of the zodiac and the course of the sun through the same. The twelve palaces are the twelve zodiacal signs; the one half of the building above ground and the other below is a symbol of the course of the sun above and below the horizon.</p>
 <p>As regards the name Labyrinth itself, much diversity of opinion exists. By a sort of antiphrasis it was formerly derived <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν θύραν</foreign>, from its difficulty of egress; but very probably 
<pb n="914" /><cb /> from <foreign lang="greek">λαύρα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">λάϝρα</foreign>), “a passage-way;” the termination being found in such words as <foreign lang="greek">μήρινθος, ὑάκινθος</foreign>. Others, finding in Manetho that an Egyptian king, named Lachares or Labaris, had erected the structure in question, make the term equivalent to “the abode of Labaris.” Brugsch regards it as the corruption of an Egyptian word meaning “the building at the entrance to a reservoir” (<title>Egypt under the Pharaohs</title>).</p>
 <p>The position of the Egyptian Labyrinth is clearly indicated by the words of Herodotus, “a little above the Lake Moeris.” It is now certain that the remains of the Labyrinth must be sought for near Sakkara in the district called Fayûm. Vast piles of rubbish are here to be seen, and the destruction is supposed to be owing to the Arabs, who may have thought that treasures were concealed under ground here. The ruins were first carefully explored, and an imperfect idea of their original plan made out by the Prussian expedition of 1843, of which Prof. Lepsius was the head. More recent expeditions are those of Mr. Petrie, to whose work the reader is referred (<title>Hawâra, Biahma, and Arsinoë</title> [1889]).

 <p> (practically identical with the Greek <foreign lang="greek">χλαμύς</foreign>). The Latin term for a coarse, dark-coloured cloak, fastened on the shoulder by a brooch, which was in use as a protection against rain. It was provided with a hood. In later times the name was given to a light and elegant mantle, either white or dyed in Tyrian purple, which was worn over the toga to complete the costume at games or other outdoor occasions. In the time of Augustus, who forbade its use in the Forum or Circus, it formed part of the military uniform. It was afterwards commonly worn even in Rome itself.

<div2 id="crosslachmann" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Lachmann</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm</foreName>
 <p>One of the greatest of modern philologists and text-critics, born at Brunswick, March 4, 1793. He began his studies at the Katharineum in Brunswick, and at once showed an extraordinary aptitude for classical literature and linguistics. In 1809 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he studied philology and theology, soon, however, transferring himself to the University of Göttingen, where the stimulating influence of Heyne and Dissen powerfully affected his intellectual development. Besides working hard at classical philology, he pursued with much ardour the scientific study of Italian, English, and Old German. In 1815, carried away by the patriotic enthusiasm which swept over Germany, he enlisted as a volunteer in the army which in that year marched upon Paris; but he had no part in active fighting.</p>
 <p>In 1816 he took the position of assistant master in the Friedrich Werder Gymnasium at Berlin, and, soon after, habilitated at the University of that place, publishing a dissertation on the <title>Nibelungennoth</title>, and almost simultaneously an edition of Propertius. Receiving an appointment as master in the Fridericianum of Königsberg, he assisted his colleague Köpke in editing Rudolf von Monfort's text of <bibl default="NO"><title>Barlaam and Josaphat</title> (1818)</bibl>, and also in preparing notes for an edition of Walther von der Vogelweide. In January, 1818, he was appointed Professor Extraordinarius of Classical Philology in the University of Königsberg, where he had Lobeck for a colleague, and where he also lectured on Middle High German literature and Old German grammar. In 1824, having received leave of absence for this purpose, he devoted some time to a thorough search through the libraries of Germany, especially of Southern Germany, for unpublished material relating to these subjects. In February, 1825, he was called to the University of Berlin as Professor Extraordinarius of Classical and German Philology, and in 1827 was promoted to Professor Ordinarius. He died March 13, 1851.</p>
 <p>Lachmann was one of the most truly scientific scholars that Germany has ever produced, and possessed a mind of singular originality, sagacity, and subtle power. In both classical and Germanic philology, and in New Testament criticism as well, his independent work has justly been styled “epoch-making.” “His influence,” says Nettleship, “on the general course of philological study has probably been greater than that of any single man during the present century. Many scholars who never saw him, and to whom he is only known by his books, have been inspired by the extraordinary impulse which he gave to critical methods. Greek, Latin, and German philology have alike felt the touch of the magician.” 
<pb n="915" /><cb /></p>
 <p>His chief classical works are the following: Editions of Propertius <date>(1816)</date>, Catullus <date>(1829)</date>, Tibullus <date>(1829)</date>, Genesis <date>(1834)</date>, Terentianus Maurus <date>(1836)</date>, Babrius <date>(1845)</date>, Avianus <date>(1845)</date>, Gaius <date>(1841- 1842)</date>, the <bibl default="NO"><title>Agrimensores Romani</title> (1848-52)</bibl>, Lucilius, and, above all, Lucretius <date>(1850)</date>. Of this last great work, Professor Munro has justly said that it is “a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied.” In his <bibl default="NO"><title>Betrachtungen über die Ilias</title> (1837, 1841)</bibl>, he attempted to show that the <title>Iliad</title> consists of sixteen independent “lays” that were subsequently enlarged and altered. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>.) In New Testament criticism he first carried out the plan first put forth by Richard <ref type="cross" target="crossbentley">Bentley</ref> (q.v.) of restoring the ancient readings current in the Eastern MSS., using the Latin authorities (and West Greek) as evidence in case of a divergence of readings in the oldest Eastern MSS. His smaller edition of the New Testament appeared in 1831 <bibl default="NO">(3d ed. 1846)</bibl>; the larger one, in two volumes (<title>Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine</title>), in the preparation of which he was aided by Philip Buttmann, in 1842-50. Of his work in Germanic philology and literature it is not necessary to speak here. Lachmann's life has been written by M. Hertz, <bibl default="NO"><title>Karl Lachmann, eine Biographie</title> (Berlin, 1851)</bibl>; and see Bursian, <title>Geschichte der class.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λακωνική</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">γῆ</foreign>), called by the Roman writers <hi rend="bold">Laconia.</hi> A country of the Peloponnesus, situated at its southern extremity, having Messenia on the west, and Arcadia and Argolis on the north. The extent of Laconia from east to west, where it reached farthest, was 1° 45', but it became narrower towards the north, and its extent from north to south was about fifty miles. As the southern parts were encompassed by the sea, and the east and northeast parts by the Sinus Argolicus, it had a great number of promontories, the chief of which were those of Malea and Taenarum, now Capes Malio and Matapan. The sea-coast of Laconia was furnished with a considerable number of seaports, towns, and commodious harbours, the chief of which were Trinnassus, Acria, Gytheum, and Epidaurus. The Laconian coasts were famous for yielding a shellfish (<seg lang="la">murex</seg>) whence was obtained <cb /> a beautiful purple dye, inferior only to that which was brought from the Red Sea and Phoenicia. The mountains of Laconia were numerous, the most famous being Taÿgetus. The principal river was the Eurotas, on which stood the capital, Sparta or Lacedaemon. The soil was very rich, especially in the low grounds, and, being well watered, was excellent for pasture; but the number of its mountains and hills prevented its being tilled so well as it might otherwise have been.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Firmiānus</hi> (in some MSS. called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius Caecilius</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crosscaelius">Caelius</ref>). An eminent Christian writer of the early part of the fourth century, whose birthplace is uncertain. He taught rhetoric at Nicomedia in Bithynia, and it was probably there that he became converted to Christianity. About the year 313 he was invited by Constantine the Great to act as tutor to his son Crispus. He died about 325. His chief work is a defence of Christianity, in seven books, entitled <title>Institutiones Divinae</title>, written in reply to an attack upon the faith made by two pagan writers. He also wrote treatises <title>De Ira Dei</title> and <title>De Opificio Dei</title>, the latter being an account of anthropology from the Christian standpoint. A fourth book, by some not credited to him, is entitled <title>De Mortibus Persecutorum</title>, in which he tries to show that all the persecutors of the Christians have met with violent deaths. There exists, also, an epitome of the <title>Institutiones Divinae</title>, made by Lactantius. His Latinity is so pure that he is styled “the Christian Cicero.” During the Middle Ages his writings were extremely popular, and the MSS. of them are very numerous. The first book ever printed in Italy <bibl default="NO">(1465)</bibl> was a Lactantius. The earlier texts are enumerated by Dufresnoy in his edition <bibl default="NO">(2 vols. 1748)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λαΐς</foreign>). The name of two celebrated Grecian hetaerae, or courtesans. (1) The elder, a native probably of Corinth, lived in the time of the Peloponnesian War, and was celebrated as the most beautiful woman of that age. She was notorious also for her avarice and caprice. One of her lovers was the Cyrenaic philosopher Aristippus, two of whose works were inscribed with her name. In her old age she took to drink. At her death she was buried in Corinth, and over her was placed a monument representing a lioness tearing a ram. So much was her reputation a part of that of her city that there arose the proverb <foreign lang="greek">οὐ Κόρινθος οὔτε Λαΐς</foreign>. A number of anecdotes regarding her are preserved in Athenaeus.</p>
 <p>(2) The younger daughter of Timandra, probably born at Hyccara in Sicily. According to some accounts she was brought to Corinth when seven years old, having been taken prisoner in the Athenian expedition to Sicily, and bought by a Corinthian. This story, however, involves numerous difficulties, and seems to have arisen from a confusion between this Laïs and the other woman of the same name. She was a contemporary and rival of <ref type="cross" target="crossphryne">Phryné</ref> (q.v.). She became enamoured of a Thessalian named Hippolochus, or Hippostratus, and accompanied him to Thessaly, where, it is said, some Thessalian women, jealous of her beauty, enticed her into a temple of Aphrodité, and there stoned her to death (Pausan. ii. 2, 5).

<head orig="Lamiae">Lamiae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λαμίαι</foreign>). Fabulous monsters, the vampires of ancient legend, commonly represented with the head and breast of a woman and the body of a serpent. According to some, they changed their forms at pleasure, and, when about to ensnare their prey, assumed such appearances as were most seductive and calculated to please. The blood of young persons was believed to possess peculiar attractions for them, and for the purpose of quaffing this they were wont to take the forms of beautiful women, the better to allure young men. The Lamiae possessed also another means of accomplishing their object. This was a species of hissing sound emitted by them, so soothing and 
<pb n="918" /><cb /> attractive in its nature that persons found themselves irresistibly allured by it. When not in disguise and when they had sated their horrid appetites, their form was hideous, their visages glowed like fire, their bodies were besmeared with blood, and their feet appeared of iron or of lead. Sometimes they showed themselves completely blind; at other times they had a single eye, either in the forehead or on one side of the visage. The popular belief made them frequent Africa and Thessaly, in both of which countries they watched along the main roads and seized upon unwary travellers.</p>
 <p>The fable of Queen Lamia has some analogy to this fiction, and both, in all probability, owe their origin to one and the same source. Lamia, according to Diodorus Siculus and other ancient authorities, was a queen of Africa, remarkable for beauty, who, on account of her cruel disposition, was eventually transformed into a wild beast. Having lost, it seems, her own children by the act of Heré, who was jealous of Lamia's intercourse with Zeus, she sought to console her sorrow by seizing the children of her subjects from their mothers' arms, and putting them to death. Hence the transformation inflicted upon her by the gods ( <bibl n="Diod.  20. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xx. 41</bibl>; Wesseling, <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Diod. l. c.). The Lamiae figured extensively in the nursery-legends of antiquity, and their names and attributes were standing objects of terror to the young ( Diod. l. c.; cf. <title>A. P.</title> 340;  <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 1177" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>1177</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λαμπαδηδρομία</foreign>, also <foreign lang="greek">λαμπαδηφορία</foreign>). A torch-race, such as were celebrated at <figure id="fig.00918">
<head orig="Torch used in the race. (Coin in Mionnet, pl. 49, fig. 6.)">Torch used in the race. (Coin in Mionnet, pl. 49, fig. 6.)</head>
</figure> Athens, Corinth, Ceos, Syros, Amphipolis, Byzantium, and other places, in honour of different deities, and probably at any great funeral games. At Athens it took place on five special occasions: at the Promethea, in honour of Prometheus; at the Panathenaea, in honour of Athené; after the Apaturia, in honour of Hephaestus; and in honour of Bendis.</p>
 <p>The race was run usually on foot, but sometimes on horses by <seg lang="la">ephebi.</seg> The torches were of two kinds—one a sort of candlestick, shown in the above illustration, and the other one of a more conventional kind, like that shown in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossfax">Fax</ref>. There were two different methods of conducting the race. The first or earlier system required lines of runners (<foreign lang="greek">λαμπαδισταί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λαμποδηφόροι</foreign>), posted at intervals, the first in each line who receives the torch, or takes it from the altar, running at his best speed and handing it to the second in his own line, and the second to the third, until the last in the line is reached, who runs with it up to the appointed spot. Of course, if any torch went out, the line to which it belonged was out of the race. The victory (<foreign lang="greek">νικᾶν λαμπάδι</foreign>) fell to that line of runners whose torch first reached the goal alight. Assuming that all the gymnasiarchs contended on each occasion, there would be ten such lines (or, after B.C. 307, twelve), one for each tribe; but it is possible that each gymnasiarch performed his service only once a year, and that only a certain number were told off for each festival. All the runners in the winning line or chain contributed to the victory, and this may possi bly <cb /> be the explanation of the well-known line of Aeschylus ( <bibl n="Aesch. Ag. 314" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ag.</title>314</bibl>), “the last and the first (i. e. all alike in the chain) are successful.” The beacons are all victorious, because all belong to the successful chain of light, as in the torch-race each person in the line shares the victory.</p>
 <p>A different kind of torch-race is described by Pausanias (i. 30. 2), in which there was no handing of the torch from one to another, but several torch-bearers started, possibly one for each tribe; the first who reached the goal with his torch alight won; the competition was individual, not one chain of runners against another; and it is no doubt to such a race that inscriptions, which speak of a single victor with a single prize, refer. The race in honour of Bendis was run on horseback.</p>
 <p>The starting-point of the race at Athens was the altar of Prometheus in the Academy, and the course was through the Ceramicus to the city, a little more than a mile. The archon basileus presided and awarded the prize.</p>
 <p>The origin of the custom is probably to be found in the honour paid to the giver of fire, Prometheus, and after him to the deities associated with the arts in which fire is used—Athené, Hephaestus, etc. See Preller, <title>Griech. Mythol.</title> p. 80 <bibl default="NO">(1872)</bibl>.

At the bottom is a circular plate of metal, resting on three balls. Within is a bronze lamp attached to the centre of the base, and provided with an extinguisher, shown on the right hand of the lantern. The plates of translucent horn, forming the sides, probably had no aperture; but the hemispherical cover may be raised so as to admit the hand and to serve instead of a door, and it is also perforated with holes through which the smoke might escape. To the two upright pillars supporting the frame-work, a front view of one of which is shown on the left hand of the lantern, chains are attached for carrying the lantern by means of the handle at the top.</p>

Those great artists, Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus, Rhodians, executed the principal figure and the sons and the wonderful folds of the serpents out of one block of marble.”</p>
 <p>This group is justly considered, by all competent judges, to be a masterpiece of art. It combines, in its class, all that sculpture requires, and both admits of, and may truly be studied as, a canon. The subject is of the most affecting and interesting kind; and the expression in every part of the figures reaches, but does not exceed, the limits of propriety. Intense mental suffering is portrayed in the countenances, while the physical strength of all the three figures is evidently sinking under the irresistible power of the huge reptiles wreathed around their exhausted limbs. One son, in whose side a serpent has fixed his deadly fangs, seems to be fainting; the other, not yet bitten, tries to disengage one foot from the serpent's embrace. The father, Laocoön, himself, is mighty in his sufferings: every muscle is in extreme action, and his hands and feet are convulsed with painful energy. Yet there is nothing frightful, disgusting, or contrary to beauty in the countenance. Suffering is faithfully and strongly depicted there, <cb /> but it is rather the exhibition of mental anguish than of the repulsive and undignified contortions of mere physical pain. The whole of this figure displays the most intimate knowledge of anatomy and of outward form; the latter selected with care, and freed from any vulgarity of common individual nature. Indeed, the single figure of Laocoön may be fairly referred to as one of the finest specimens existing of that combination of truth and beauty which is so essential to the production of perfect sculpture, and which can alone insure for it lasting admiration. The sons are of a smaller standard than the proportion of the father—a liberty hardly justifiable, but taken, probably, with the view of heightening the effect of the principal figure by the so-called “pyramidal” arrangement. The right arm of Laocoö is a restoration; but so ably done, though only in plaster, that the deficiency is said to be scarcely a blemish. Some antiquarians have thought that the original action of the arm was not extended, but that this limb was bent back towards the head; and they have supported their hypothesis by the fact of there being a rough and broken surface where they think the hand, or perhaps a fold of the serpent, may have come in contact with the hair. This view is rendered still more probable by a smaller figure of Laocoön, now in the Museum at Naples. Though much mutilated, it is evidently copied from the famous group, and is sufficiently preserved to show that the arms were drawn back, as described above.</p>

When the two gods had done their work, Laomedon refused them the reward he had promised them, and expelled them from his dominions. <cb /> Thereupon Poseidon sent a marine monster to ravage the country, to which the Trojans were obliged, from time to time, to sacrifice a maiden. On one occasion it was decided by lot that Hesioné, the daughter of Laomedon, should be the victim; but she was saved by Heracles, who slew the monster, upon Laomedon promising to give him the horses which Tros had once received from Zeus as a compensation for Ganymedes. But when the monster was slain, Laomedon again broke his word. Thereupon Heracles sailed with a squadron of six ships against Troy, killed Laomedon, with all his sons except Priam, and gave Hesioné to Telamon.

<head orig="Lares">Lares</head>

 <p> Gods of inferior power worshipped at Rome, of human origin and presiding over houses and families. There were various classes of them, such as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Urbāni</hi>, to preside over the cities; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Familiāres</hi>, over houses; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Rustĭci</hi>, over the country; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Compitāles</hi>, over crossways; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marīni</hi>, over the sea; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Viāles</hi>, over roads, etc. The Lares were originally human beings themselves, who lived upon the earth, and, becoming pure spirits after death, loved still to hover round the dwelling which they once inhabited, to watch over its safety, and to guard it with as much care as the faithful dog does the possessions of its master. They keep off, therefore, danger from without, while the <ref type="cross" target="crosspenates">Penates</ref> (q.v.), residing in the interior of the dwelling, pour forth benefits upon its inmates. The fundamental idea, on which rests the doctrine of the Lares, is intimately connected with all the psychology and pneumatology of the ancient Italians. According to Apuleius the <seg lang="la">daemones</seg> which once had inhabited, as souls, human bodies, were called Lemures: this name therefore designated, in general, the spirit separated from the body. Such a spirit, if it adopted its posterity—if it took possession, with favourable power, of the abode of its children—was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lar familiaris</hi>. If on the contrary, by reason of the faults committed in life, it found in the grave no resting place, it appeared to men as a phantom; inoffensive to the good, but terrible to the wicked. Its name was in that case <hi rend="SmallCaps">Larva</hi>. As, however, there was no way of precisely ascertaining what had been the lot of a deceased person, whether he had become, for example, a Lar or a Larva, it was customary to give to the dead the general appellation of <ref type="cross" target="crossmanes">Manes</ref>. The mother of the Lares was called Lara or Larunda (Arnob. <title>Adv. Gent.</title> iii. 41; Macrob. i. 7). This conception of the Lares, as the souls of fathers and of forefathers, protectors of their children, and watching over the safety of their descendants, necessarily gave rise to the custom of burying the dead within the dwelling ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 5. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>v. 64</bibl>; vi. 152;  <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 15. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xv. 11</bibl>). Men wished to have near them these tutelary genii, in order to be certain of their assistance and support. In process of time, however, this custom was prohibited at Rome by the laws of the Twelve Tables.</p>
 <p>The Etrurians, and the Romans after them, had their <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lares publĭci</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lares privāti</hi>. The Lares were supposed to assist at all gatherings of men, at all public assemblies or reunions, in all transactions of men, and in all the most important affairs of State as well as of individuals. As each <cb /> individual had his Lar, his genius, his guardian spirit, even the infant at the breast, so entire families, and whole races and nations, were equally under the protection of one of these tutelar deities. Here the Lares became in some degree confounded with the Heroes, that is, with the spirits of those who, having deserved well of their country while on earth, continued to watch over and protect it. It would seem, too, that at times the worship of these public Lares, like that of the public Penates, was not without some striking resemblance to that rendered to the great national divinities.</p>
 <p>All that the house contained was confided to the superintending care of these vigilant genii: they were set as a watch over all things large and small, and hence the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Praestĭtes</hi>, which is sometimes given them (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5. 128" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>v. 128</bibl><bibl n="Ov. Fast. 132" default="NO" valid="yes"> Fast., 132</bibl>). Hence the dog was the natural symbol of the Lares; an image of this animal was placed by the side of their statues, or else these were covered with the skin of a dog. The ordinary altar on which sacrifices were offered to the Lares was the domestic hearth. The victims consisted of a hog ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>iii. 23</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 4</bibl>) or a fowl; sometimes, with the rich, of a young steer; to them were also presented the first fruits of the season, and libations of wine were poured out. In all the family repasts, the first thing done was to cast a portion of all the viands into the fire that burned on the hearth, in honour of the Lares. In the form of marriage, called <hi rend="italic">coëmptio</hi>, the bride always threw a piece of money on the hearth to the Lares of her family, and deposited another in the neighbouring cross-road, in order to obtain admission, as it were, into the dwelling of her husband. Young persons, after their fifteenth year, consecrated to the Lares the bulla which they had worn from infancy ( <bibl n="Pers.  5. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.v. 31</bibl>). Soldiers, when their time of service was once ended, dedicated to them the arms with which they had fought (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iv. 8, 21). Captives and slaves restored to freedom consecrated to the Lares the fetters from which they had just been freed ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl>). Before undertaking a journey, or after a successful return, homage was paid to these deities, their protection was implored, or thanks were rendered for their guardian care (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> i. 3, 33). The new master of a house crowned the Lares, in order to render them propitious; a custom which was of the most universal nature, and which was perpetuated to the latest times (Plaut. <title>Trinum.</title> i. 2, 1). The proper place for worshipping the Lares, and where their images stood, was called Lararium, a sort of domestic chapel in the atrium, where were also to be seen the images and busts of the family ancestors. The rich had often two Lararia, one large and the other small; they had also “Masters of the Lares,” and “Decuries of the Lares”—namely, slaves specially charged with the care of these domestic chapels and the images of their divinities. As to the poor, their Lares had to be content with the simple hearth, where honours not less simple were paid to them. Certain public festivals were also celebrated in honour of the Lares, called <ref type="cross" target="crosslararia">Lararia</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosscompitalia">Compitalia</ref>. The period for their celebration fell in the month of December, a little after that of the Saturnalia. The Compitalia, dedicated to the Lares Compitales, were celebrated in the open air, in the cross-roads. The day of their celebration was not fixed. They were introduced at Rome by Servius Tullius, who left to the Senate the care of determining the period 
<pb n="923" /><cb />
 when they should be held. In early times, children were immolated to the goddess Mania, the mother, according to some, of the Lares, to propitiate her favour for the protection of the family. This barbarous rite was subsequently abolished, and little balls of wool were hung up in the stead of human offerings at the gates of dwellings. Macrobius ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 7" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 7</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 34" default="NO"> Sat., 34</bibl>) informs us that it was Junius Brutus who, after the expulsion of the Tarquins, introduced a new form of sacrifice, by virtue of which heads of garlic and poppies were offered up in place of human heads, <seg lang="la">ut pro capitibus capitibus supplicaretur</seg>, in accordance with the oracle of Apollo.</p>
 <p>As regards the forms under which the Lares were represented, it may be observed that it dif<figure id="fig.00923">
<head orig="Lares. (Duruy.)">Lares. (Duruy.)</head>
</figure> fered often but little from that of the Penates. Thus, on the coins of the Caesian family, they are represented as two young men, seated, their heads covered with helmets, and holding spears in their hands, while a dog watches at their feet. Sometimes, as has already been remarked, the heads of the Lares are represented as covered with, or their mantle as formed of, the skin of a dog. At other times we find the Lares resembling naked children, with the bulla hanging from the neck.

 <head>Pronunciation of <term>Latin</term></head>
 <p>Three methods of pronouncing Latin are in use in this country at the present time, described respectively as the English method, the Continental method, and the Roman or Phonetic method.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. The English Method</hi>, in general, pronounces Latin words as though they were English. The tendency of this system is frequently to obscure the vowel sounds. Thus, before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> final, or followed by another consonant, <seg lang="la">e, i</seg>, and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are scarcely distinguishable from one another. Between <hi rend="italic">qu</hi> and <seg lang="la">rt, a</seg> receives a sound like <seg lang="la">o</seg>—e. g. in <seg lang="la">quartus.</seg> The quantities of unaccented syllables are not carefully rendered. The diphthongs <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> are sounded like <hi rend="italic">ē</hi> in <hi rend="italic">be; au</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">author; eu</hi>, as in <seg lang="la">neuter; ui</seg>, like <hi rend="italic">ī</hi> in <hi rend="italic">like</hi>—e. g. <seg lang="la">cui, huic</seg>, etc. <title>C</title> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> are pronounced soft (like English <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi>) before <seg lang="la">e, i, y, ae</seg>, or <title>oe. Ch</title> is hard, like <hi rend="italic">k; c, s</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">t</hi>, in such words as <title>socius, militia, Alsium, anxius</title>, receive the sound of <title>sh. G</title> and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> are silent before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (e. g. <title>Gnaeus, Mnemon); ch</title> and <hi rend="italic">ph</hi> before a mute (e. g. <title>Chthonia, Phthia); p</title> before <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">t</hi> (e. g. <title>Psyche, Ptolemaeus</title>); and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> before <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (e. g. <title>Tmolus</title>).</p>
 <p>The English method is falling into desuetude in this country, and will probably soon be wholly obsolete. In England, the leading Latinists have long since repudiated it in theory, but the conservatism of the schools clings to it as being the old <cb /> historic usage of English scholarship; whereas it is nothing of the kind, but a comparatively modern innovation, as shown below.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. The Continental Method</hi> gives to the consonants in general the same sounds as in the English method, and to the vowels the following sounds: <seg lang="la">a</seg>, as in <seg lang="la">father; e</seg>, like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <seg lang="la">make; i</seg>, as in <seg lang="la">machine; o</seg>, as in <hi rend="italic">go; u</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">moo; y</hi>, like <seg lang="la">e</seg> in <seg lang="la">me; ae</seg> and <hi rend="italic">oe</hi>, like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <hi rend="italic">make; au</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> in <hi rend="italic">out.</hi> The tendency of this method also is to neglect difference of quantity in unaccented syllables.</p>
 <p>The name “Continental Method” is rather a misnomer, as there is on the continent of Europe no uniform system, the scholars of each nation pronouncing the consonants as in their own language. Thus, a German pronouncing <title>Cicero</title>, says <title>Tsitsĕro;</title> an Italian, <title>Chichĕro;</title> a Frenchman, <title>Sisĕro;</title> a Spaniard, <title>Thithĕro</title>, and so on. Yet the practical identity of the vowel-sounds in all the chief continental languages and the fact that only a few of the consonants vary in pronunciation, make the so-called Continental System, as used in this country, one that is easily intelligible to any Continental Latinist. It is used by the Catholic clergy and in a number of colleges, and is substantially the system that has always prevailed at the Scotch universities.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. The Roman</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phonetic Method</hi> aims to reproduce, so far as our present knowledge makes such a thing possible, the pronunciation used by the Romans themselves in the classical period. It distinguishes very carefully between long and short vowels, even in syllables where the natural vocalic quantities are obscured by their position before two consonants.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ā</hi>, as in <seg lang="la">father; ă</seg>, as in <title>Cuba.</title></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ē</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">they; ĕ</hi>, like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <title>Senate.</title></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ī</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">machine; ĭ</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">pin.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ō</hi>, as in <seg lang="la">note; ŏ</seg>, as in <hi rend="italic">obey.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ū</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">moo; ŭ</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">hood.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ae=ah-ee</hi> quickly spoken.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">au</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> in <hi rend="italic">out.</hi></p>
 <p><seg lang="la">ei</seg>, as in <hi rend="italic">eight.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">oe=oh-ee</hi> quickly spoken.</p>
 <p><seg lang="la">ui</seg>, like <hi rend="italic">wee</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> (nearly).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">eu</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">feud</hi> (nearly).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">ȳ</hi>, like German <hi rend="italic">ü; y</hi>, the same sound short.</p>
 <p>The pronunciation of the consonants is as follows:</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">b=b</hi> in English; before <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">t=p.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">c=k</hi> (always).</p>

 <p><hi rend="italic">f=f</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">g=g</hi> in <hi rend="italic">get</hi> (always hard).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">h=h</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">j </hi> (<seg lang="la">i</seg>-consonant)=<hi rend="italic">y</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">l=l</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">m=m</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">n=n</hi> in English; but before <hi rend="italic">c, q, g</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">x=ng</hi> in <hi rend="italic">linger.</hi></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">p=p</hi> in English.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">q=q</hi> in English. (It is always, in Latin, followed by <hi rend="italic">u.</hi>) </p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">r=r</hi> in English with a slight trill.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">s=s</hi> in <seg lang="la">sit.</seg></p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">t=t</hi> in English, and never assibilated.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">v </hi> (<hi rend="italic">u</hi>-consonant)=<hi rend="italic">w</hi> in English.</p>

 <p>Our knowledge of how the Romans pronounced 
<pb n="925" /><cb />
 their own language is derived from several sources: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) from the statements of the Roman writers themselves, especially of the grammarians; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) from the orthography of the language, which was, in the main, phonetic ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 7</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 11</bibl>); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) from the way in which the Greeks represented Roman sounds in Greek characters—spelling by ear; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) from a comparison of all the modern languages derived from the Latin with reference to the points which they possess in common; (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) from the spelling of the Latin words taken into German, Gothic, and Anglo-Saxon at an early period; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) from the traditions of scholars as set forth in the treatises of Erasmus, Lipsius, and others, as cited below; (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) from the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church, which has employed Latin in its rites from the first century to the present time; (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) from the general principles of the science of phonology. These sources were very carefully investigated, and the results they yield were correlated by Dr. Wilhelm <ref type="cross" target="crosscorssen">Corssen</ref> (q.v.) in his great work, <title>Ueber Aussprache, Vokalismus, und Betonung der lateinischen Sprache</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1858-59; 2d ed. 1868-70)</bibl>, since the appearance of which the ancient system of pronunciation has made steady progress in gaining the acceptance of scholars all over the world. In 1859, Professor J. F. Richardson, of the University of Rochester, put forth an excellent little volume advocating the true method; and in 1872, Professors Munro and Palmer in England, at the request of the head-masters of the public schools, prepared and published a condensed statement of the Roman system, entitled <bibl default="NO"><title>A Syllabus of Latin Pronunciation</title> (Oxford and Cambridge, 1872)</bibl>, which received the approval of the two great universities and of all the leading Latinists of England. The Roman system has now practically supplanted the other two in the leading schools, colleges, and universities of the United States. This is not due to the greater willingness of Americans to accept what is new, but to practical considerations that will readily occur to any one. In the United States, the inconveniences of having no standard system have been very great. New England, being wholly settled from Old England, long continued the English system of pronouncing Latin. In the Middle States, the Germans and Dutch introduced their own methods; in the South and West, the French pronunciation came in quite frequently; and all over the Union, the Catholic clergy in their schools and colleges have propagated the traditional usage of their Church. Hence, a Babel of pronunciations and systems existing and practised side by side in a picturesque confusion such as no European country ever knew; and hence the general willingness to accept a single method, especially one that is based upon historic truth.</p>
 <p>The advantages of the Roman system, briefly stated, are these: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) It is approximately the system used by the Romans themselves. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) It is more musical and harmonious in sound, and makes the structure of Latin verse clear even to the beginner. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) It is simpler than the English system, giving as it does but one sound to each alphabetical character, and thus always distinguishing words of different orthography and meaning by their sounds, while the English system often confuses them—e. g. <seg lang="la">census</seg> and <seg lang="la">sensus; caedo, cedo</seg>, and <seg lang="la">sedo; circulus</seg> and <seg lang="la">surculus; cervus</seg> and <seg lang="la">servus; amici</seg> and <seg lang="la">amisi. (d)</seg> It makes the connection of <cb /> Latin words with their Greek cognates plain at once, and renders easier the study of Greek, of the modern Romance languages, and of the science of Comparative Philology.</p>
 <p>Advocates of other systems have made their chief assault upon the Roman method because of its dictum regarding the pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> They say that Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> must have had a modified sound before <seg lang="la">e</seg> and <seg lang="la">i</seg>, because every modern language derived from the Latin has so modified it.</p>
 <p>But it must be remembered that the modern Romance languages are the children, not of the classical Latin spoken in the days of Cicero, but of the provincial Latin spoken five or six centuries later. There is no doubt that at this late period Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> had become modified before <seg lang="la">e</seg> or <seg lang="la">i</seg> so as to be equivalent to <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> Latin words received into German at this time represent <hi rend="italic">c</hi> before <seg lang="la">e</seg> or <seg lang="la">i</seg> by <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> But had this modification been a part of the usage of the classical language, it would have been noticed by the grammarians, who discuss each letter with great minuteness. Now, no grammarian ever mentions more than one sound for Latin <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Again, if Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> had ever had the sound of <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, surely some of the Greeks, ignorant of Latin and spelling by ear, would at least occasionally have represented Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> by <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>—a thing which none of them has ever done, always using <foreign lang="greek">κ</foreign>. It is probable that the modification of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> which is noticed in the modern languages was a characteristic of the Umbrian and Oscan dialects (the Umbrian had a special character to denote the modified sound), and so prevailed to some extent in the provinces; but there is absolutely not the slightest evidence to show that it formed a part of the pronunciation of cultivated men at Rome. On the other hand, words taken into Gothic and Old High German from the Latin at an early period invariably represent Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> by <hi rend="italic">k</hi>: thus, Latin <seg lang="la">carcer</seg> gives the Gothic <hi rend="italic">karkara</hi> and the German <title>Kerker;</title> Latin <title>Caesar</title> gives the German <title>Kaiser;</title> Latin <seg lang="la">lucerna</seg> gives the Gothic <hi rend="italic">lukarn;</hi> the Latin <seg lang="la">cellarium</seg> gives the German <title>Keller;</title> the Latin <seg lang="la">cerasus</seg> gives the German <title>Kirsche.</title> Also in late Hebrew, Latin <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is regularly represented in transliteration by the hard consonant <hi rend="italic">kôph.</hi> In Latin inscriptions, also, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> alternates with <hi rend="italic">k</hi>, showing it to have had the same sound. Thus we find <title>Caelius</title> and <title>Kaelius, Cerus</title> and <title>Kerus, decembres</title> and <hi rend="italic">dekembres.</hi> (See, also, <bibl n="Quint.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 7</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  10" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 10</bibl>).</p>
 <p>As to <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, the Greeks transliterated it by <hi rend="italic">ou</hi>, writing <foreign lang="greek">Οὐαλήριος</foreign> for <title>Valerius</title>, <foreign lang="greek">Οὐόλσκοι</foreign> for <title>Volsci</title>, etc., while it passes easily into <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in such forms as <seg lang="la">cautum</seg> for <seg lang="la">cavitum, fautor</seg> for <seg lang="la">favitor</seg>, etc.</p>
 <p>“It is not always remembered that only very gradually was the true pronunciation of Latin lost in Europe. Scholars long retained the essential features of it, and by the fact of their constant intercourse long prevented the growth of local and national variations from the established method. Great teachers like Erasmus passed from country to country, lecturing in Latin at the universities of Italy, Germany, Holland, France, and England; teaching pupils of all nationalities, and being everywhere understood without any difficulty, for Latin was the <seg lang="la">lingua franca</seg> of the educated, and one general pronunciation of it prevailed. Even in England, it was only after that country's isolation, political and religious, in the sixteenth century, that an ‘English pronunciation’ arose, and this was long protested against—e. g. by Cardinal 
<pb n="926" /><cb /> Wolsey, by Milton, and as late as the last century by Ainsworth <bibl default="NO">(1746)</bibl> and Philipps <bibl default="NO">(1750)</bibl>. For the Continental traditions, see Justus Lipsius in his <title>Dialogus de Recta Pronunciatione Linguae Latinae;</title> and Erasmus, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Recta Latini Graecique Sermonis Pronunciatione</title> (Basle, 1528)</bibl>. In Scotland, the Continental sound of the vowels was long retained, on which see the incident imagined by Sir Walter Scott in his novel <title>The Fortunes of Nigel</title>, ch. ix.” (Peck).</p>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Ius Latii</hi> designated, in the later republican and early imperial period, a special legal status conferred upon the inhabitants of many provincial municipalities—a status midway between that of Roman citizens (<seg lang="la">cives</seg>) and that of aliens (<seg lang="la">peregrini</seg>). Historically, the Latin allies of Rome had always enjoyed special treaty rights; and when the people of Latium received full citizenship, similar rights were bestowed upon certain colonies in other parts of Italy. After the Social War and the extension of Roman citizenship on the entire peninsula, <title>Latini colonarii</title> were found only in the provinces. Where <title>minus ius Latii</title> was conferred upon a municipality, all its citizens who were chosen as municipal magistrates became <seg lang="la">ipso facto</seg> Roman citizens; where <title>maius ius Latii</title> was given, the <seg lang="la">decuriones</seg> or municipal senators also became Roman citizens. In both cases all free inhabitants of the municipality enjoyed <seg lang="la">commercium</seg> with Rome, but not <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> —i. e. the Roman law of property could be invoked by them, but they had no part in Roman family law. With the edict of Caracalla, conferring citizenship upon all the free inhabitants of the Roman Empire, the <title>Latini colonarii</title> disappeared.</p>
 <p>A second and distinct class of Latins was established in the early imperial period by a <title>lex Iunia</title> or <title>Iunia Norbana</title> (A.D. 19?). This law enacted that freedmen (<seg lang="la">liberti</seg>) who had been informally manumitted from slavery, and who were free only by virtue of praetorian protection (<seg lang="la">tuitione praetoris</seg>) should have, with some exceptions, the status of <title>Latini colonarii.</title> These <title>Latini Iuniani</title> were not citizens, and had no political rights; they had no <seg lang="la">conubium</seg>, and their marriages, like those of slaves, were purely <seg lang="la">de facto</seg> matters, creating neither <seg lang="la">manus</seg> over the wife nor <seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg> over the children; and they had only a restricted <seg lang="la">commercium—inter vivos</seg>, but not <seg lang="la">mortis causa.</seg> Their contracts were perfectly valid, but they could neither <cb /> take inheritances or legacies nor dispose of their property by testament. Their estates, in fact, were treated as <seg lang="la">peculia</seg> or slave-estates, and went at death to the former master or his heirs. There were, however, several methods in which this <title>Latina libertas</title> might be converted into full citizenship (cf. Ulpian, <title>Fragmenta</title>, iii. 1-6). The <title>Latini Iuniani</title> were unaffected by the edict of Caracalla, but disappeared under the legislation of Justinian (Gains, <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1.  23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 23</bibl> foll.<bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 3.  85" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., iii. 85</bibl> foll.; Codex, 7, 6, 1. 1).

<div2 id="crosslatium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Latium">Latium</head>

 <p> (from <seg lang="la">latus</seg>, “the level land”). A country of Italy, lying south of Etruria, from which it was separated by the Tiber. The earliest records of Italian history, as we are assured by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (i. 9), represented the plains of Latium as first inhabited by the Siculi, a people of obscure origin, but who would be entitled to our notice from the circumstance above mentioned, even had they not acquired additional historical importance from their subsequent migration to the celebrated island from them named Sicily. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssiculi">Siculi</ref>.) Ancient writers do not seem agreed as to the name of the people who compelled the Siculi to abandon Latium. Dionysius informs us that Philistus ascribed their expulsion to the Umbri and Pelasgi. Thucydides refers the same event to the Opici; while Antiochus of Syracuse, a still more ancient writer, represents the Siculi as flying from the Oenotri. Notwithstanding this apparent discrepance, it is pretty evident that under these different names of Umbri, Opici, and Oenotri, the same people are designated whom Dionysius and the Roman historians usually term Aborigines (<title>Ant. Rom.</title> i. 10). The Aborigines, intermixing with several Pelasgic colonies, occupied Latium, and soon formed themselves into the several communities of Latini, Rutuli, Hernici, and Volsci, even prior to date of the supposed arrival of Aeneas.</p>
 <p>The name Prisci Latini was first given to certain cities of Latium (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspagus">Pagus</ref>), supposed to have been colonized by Latinus Silvius, one of the kings of Alba, but most of which were afterwards conquered and destroyed by Ancus Marcius and Tarquinius Priscus (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 3</bibl>). In the reign of Tarquinius Superbus the Latin nation was united under the form of a confederate Republic, and acknowledged that ambitious king as the protector of their league (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 50</bibl>). After the expulsion of the tyrant from Rome, we are told that the Latins, who favoured his cause, experienced a total defeat near the Lake Regillus, and were obliged to sue for peace (Dion. Hal. vi. 18). According to this historian, the Latins received the thanks of the Roman Senate, some years afterwards, for having taken no advantage of the disturbances at Rome, which finally led to the secession of the people to Mons Sacer, and for having, on the contrary, offered every assistance in their power on that occasion; he adds, also, that a perpetual league, known as the Latin League, was formed at that time between the Romans and the Latins. However, 
<pb n="927" /><cb /> about 143 years afterwards, we find the latter openly rebelling, and refusing to supply the usual quota of troops which they had agreed to furnish as allies of Rome. Their bold demand, which was urged through L. Annius Setinus, in the Roman Senate, that one of the consuls at least should be chosen out of their nation, led to an open rupture. A war followed (B.C. 340-338), known as the Latin War, which was rendered remarkable from the circumstances of the execution of the young Manlius by order of his father, and the devotion of Decius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecius">Decius</ref>.) After having been defeated in several encounters, the Latins were reduced to subjection, with the exception of a few towns, which experienced greater lenity, and Latium thenceforth ceased to be an independent State (<bibl n="Liv.  8. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, viii. 14</bibl>; <bibl n="Plin.  34. 5" default="NO">Pliny, xxxiv. 5</bibl>). At that time the rights of Roman citizens had been granted to a few only of the Latin cities; but at a later period the Gracchi sought to level all such distinctions between the Latins and the Romans. This measure, however, was not carried. The Social War followed; and though the confederates were finally conquered, after a long and desperate contest, the Senate thought it advisable to decree that all the Latin cities which had not taken part with the allies should enjoy the rights of Roman citizens. Many of these towns were, however, deprived of their privileges by Sulla ; and it was not till the close of the Republic that the Latins were admitted generally to participate in all the rights and immunities enjoyed by the Quirites. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfoederatae-civitates">Foederatae Civitates</ref>.</p>
 <p>The name of Latium was at first given to that portion of Italy only which extends from the mouth of the Tiber to the Circeian promontory, a distance of about fifty miles along the coast; but subsequently this latter boundary was removed to the river Liris, whence arose the distinction of <title>Latium Antiquum</title> or <title>Vetus</title> and <title>Novum</title> or <title>Adiectum</title> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 59" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iii. 59</bibl>). At a still later period, the southern boundary of Latium was extended from the Liris to the mouth of the river Vulturnus and the Massic Hills. See <ref type="cross" target="crossitalia">Italia</ref>.

<head orig="Latruncŭli">Latrunculi</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πεσσοί, ψῆφοι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">calces, calculi</seg>). A game of skill not unlike our game of checkers or draughts. It was played in a variety of ways by both the Greeks and the Romans; and in Egypt there have been found paintings representing the game, while checkers of metal, glass, etc., have been taken from the tombs. Homer represents the suitors of Penelopé as playing the game (<title>Odyss.</title> <figure id="fig.00927">
<head orig="Egyptian Checker-player. (Papyrus at Leyden of B.C. 1700.)">Egyptian Checker-player. (Papyrus at Leyden of B.C. 1700.)</head>
</figure> i. 107), which was traditionally said to have been invented by Palamedes, to whom dice are also ascribed ( <title>Frag.</title> 380, 381 Dind.). The older form of the Greek game was the game of five lines (<foreign lang="greek">πέντε γραμμαί</foreign>, <bibl n="Poll.  9. 97" default="NO">Poll.ix. 97</bibl>). It is probable that in this the object of the player was to hem in the enemy's men or place one of them between two of his, in which case it could be removed from the board; and thus the game was won when all the enemy's pieces had been taken or else so hemmed in as to be unable to move. The men were perhaps moved along lines rather than squares; but Liddell and Scott suggests that the five lines marked off thirtysix squares (i. e. divided by five lines each way).</p>
 <p>The other kind of Greek <foreign lang="greek">πεττεία</foreign> was called <foreign lang="greek">πόλεις</foreign>, this name indicating the <foreign lang="greek">χῶραι</foreign> or squares, which in this form of the game are distinctly mentioned ( <bibl n="Poll.  9. 98" default="NO">Poll.ix. 98</bibl>). Here, too, the pieces are of different colours and are called <foreign lang="greek">κύνες</foreign> (“dogs”). The object in this form of the game was the same as in the other—to bring the opponent to a standstill or to capture all his men. 
<pb n="928" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the Roman forms of the game we find mention of some pieces more powerful than the others, like the “kings” of modern checkers. The latrunculi are sometimes called <seg lang="la">latrones</seg> and sometimes <seg lang="la">milites</seg>, and the game was regarded as representing a combat between two armies. The pieces stood on squares and not on lines (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> x. 22). The phrase for blocking an opponent's moves is <seg lang="la">ad incitas (calces) redigere;</seg> to attack his <seg lang="la">ligare, obligare</seg> or (more usually) <seg lang="la">adligare.</seg></p>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Latomiae.</hi> A name properly denoting a quarry, and derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">λᾶας</foreign>, <cb /> “a stone,” and <foreign lang="greek">τέμνω</foreign>, “to cut” or “quarry.” This appellation was particularly applied to certain quarries near Syracuse, one of which still bears the name of “The Ear of Dionysius,” because it is said to have been used by that tyrant for a prison, and to have been so constructed that all the sounds uttered in it converged to and united in one particular point, termed, in consequence, the tympanum. This point communicated with an apartment (the famous “Ear of Dionysius”), where Dionysius placed himself, and thus overheard all that was said by his unsuspecting captives. There is no doubt that these quarries actually served as places of imprisonment, and Cicero reproaches Verres with having employed them for this purpose in the case of Roman citizens ( <title>Verr.</title> v. 27). Aelian informs us that some of the workmen in the quarries near Syracuse remained so long there as to marry and rear families in them, and that some of their children, having never before seen a city, were terrified on their coming to Syracuse, and beholding for the first time horses and oxen (Aelian, <title>V.

<head orig="Lectisternium">Lectisternium</head>

 <p> A festival of Greek origin, first ordered at Rome by the Sibylline Books in B.C. 399. It was held on exceptional occasions, particularly in times of great distress. Images of the gods (probably portable figures of wood draped with robes, and with their heads made of marble, clay, or wax) were laid on a couch (called the <seg lang="la">lectus</seg> or <seg lang="la">pulvinar</seg>). A table was placed before them, on which was laid out a meal, always a free-will offering. At the first Lectisternia, there were three <seg lang="la">lecti</seg> arranged for three pairs of non-Roman divinities—Apollo and Latona, Heracles and Artemis (Diana), Hermes (Mercury), and Poseidon (Neptune). Afterwards, this sacrifice was offered to the six pairs of Roman gods, who corresponded to the twelve great gods of the Greeks: Iupiter, Iuno, <cb /> Neptune, Minerva, Mars, Venus, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Vesta, Mercury, and Ceres. These banquets to the gods generally took place at festivals of prayer and thanksgiving, which were called Sup<figure id="fig.00929.2">

</figure> plicationes (q. v.), and were performed in the market-places or at appointed temples, in which the arrangements for the purpose were on a permanent footing. It was customary to have connected with this a domestic feast, to which both strangers and friends were invited, and in which even those imprisoned for debt were allowed to participate. From the commencement of the third century B.C. a banquet was regularly given to the three Capitoline divinities, Iupiter, Iuno, and Minerva, on every 13th of November, in conjunction with the Plebeian Games. Under the Empire, the celebra<figure id="fig.00929.3">

<div2 id="crosslegatum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Legātum">Legatum</head>

 <p> A legacy; a term of Roman law defined in the <title>Digest</title> (31, 1, 36), as <seg lang="la">donatio testamento relicta</seg>—i. e. a legatum implies a formal testament and universal succession. A legacy could only be given in the Latin language. If given unconditionally, it was said to be given <seg lang="la">pure;</seg> if otherwise, <seg lang="la">sub condicione.</seg></p>
 <p>There were four forms in which a legacy could be left: <seg lang="la">per vindicationem, per damnationem, sinendi modo, per praeceptionem.</seg></p>
 <p>A legatum <seg lang="la">per vindicationem</seg> was given in these words: <title>Hominem Stichum do, lego</title>, or the words might be with reference to the legatee, <title>Capito, sumito, sibi habeto.</title> A legatum <seg lang="la">per vindicationem</seg> was so called with reference to the legal means by which the legatee asserted his right to the legacy against the heir or any possessor, which was by a <seg lang="la">vindicatio</seg> (q. v.) or an <seg lang="la">actio in rem</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossactio">Actio</ref>); for as soon as the <seg lang="la">hereditatis aditio</seg> had taken place, the legatee had the quiritary (<title>ex iure Quiritium</title>) ownership of the legacy. If the same thing was given to more than one person, either jointly (<seg lang="la">coniunctim</seg>), so as to make them <hi rend="italic">collegetarii</hi>, or severally (<hi rend="italic">disiunctim</hi>), each took an equal share. A legatum was given <seg lang="la">coniunctim</seg>, thus: <title>Titio et Seio hominem Stichum do, lego; disiunctim</title>, thus: <title>Titio hominem Stichum do, lego; Seio eundem hominem do, lego.</title> If one <seg lang="la">collegatarius</seg> failed to take, his portion went to the others.</p>
 <p>The formula <seg lang="la">per damnationem</seg> was this: <title>Heres meus Stichum servum meum dare damnas esto;</title> but the word dato was equally effective. A thing which belonged to another (<seg lang="la">aliena res</seg>) could be thus left, and the heres was bound to procure the thing for the legatee, or to pay him the value of it. A thing not in existence at the date of the will might be left by this form—i. e. the future produce of a female slave (<seg lang="la">ancilla</seg>). The legatee did not acquire the quiritary ownership of the legacy by virtue of the <seg lang="la">hereditatis aditio;</seg> the thing still remained the property of the heir, and the legatee could only sue for it by an <seg lang="la">actio in personam.</seg> If it was a thing <seg lang="la">mancipi</seg>, the legatee could only acquire the quiritary ownership of it by <seg lang="la">mancipatio</seg> or in <seg lang="la">iure cessio</seg> from the heir; if it was merely delivered, the <seg lang="la">legatarius</seg> only acquired the complete ownership (<seg lang="la">plenum ius</seg>) by <hi rend="italic">usucapion</hi> (q. v.).</p>
 <p>The form of legacy <seg lang="la">sinendi modo</seg> was <quote lang="la">Haeres meus damnas esto sinere L. Titium hominem Stichum sumen sibique habere</quote>, 
<pb n="931" /><cb /> by which formula the testator could bequeath anything that belonged to himself or to his heir, at the time of his decease; and as in the previous case, the legatee had merely an <seg lang="la">actio in personam</seg> against the heir, though it was doubted whether the form of bequest imposed any active duty on the latter, it being argued that his only obligation was to allow the legatee to “take” the object bequeathed to him.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">legatum per praeceptionem</seg> was in this form: <title>Lucius Titius hominem Stichum praecipito</title>—i. e. “take first.” The Sabiniani were of opinion that a legacy could only thus be left to one who was also made an heir; but a <seg lang="la">senatus consultum</seg> of Nero made the legacy good, even if it was thus left to another than the heir, provided the legatee was a person to whom a legacy could be left in any of the three other modes.</p>
 <p>By the Twelve Tables, a man could dispose of his property as he pleased, and he might exhaust (<seg lang="la">erogare</seg>) the whole <seg lang="la">hereditas</seg> by legacies and bequests of freedom to slaves, so as to leave the heir nothing. The consequence was that in such cases the heirs refused to take the <seg lang="la">hereditas</seg>, and there was, of course, an intestacy. The first legislative measure on this subject was the Lex Furia Testamentaria (B.C. 183), which did not allow a testator to give as a <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa</seg> or as a legacy more than a thousand asses to one person, certain relatives excepted. But this measure did not prevent a man from giving as many several thousands to as many persons as he pleased, and so exhausting his estate. The Lex Voconia (B.C. 169) afterwards enacted that no person should take, by way of legacy or <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa</seg>, more than the heirs (severally, as it seems); but this was also ineffectual; for, by distributing the <seg lang="la">hereditas</seg> among numerous legatees, the heir might have so small a portion as not to make it worth his while to assume the burdens attached to the inheritance. The Lex Falcidia (B.C. 40) at last took away all means of evasion by declaring that a testator should not give more than three fourths in legacies, and thus a fourth was secured to the heir. The Lex Falcidia applied to the wills of persons who died in captivity (<seg lang="la">apud hostes</seg>), for a previous Lex Cornelia had given to the wills of such persons the same force as if they had died <seg lang="la">cives.</seg></p>
 <p>Legata were <seg lang="la">inutilia</seg> or void if they were given before an heir was instituted by the will, for the will derived all its legal efficacy from such institution; there was the same rule as to a gift of freedom. It was void if in form the gift was given after the death of the heir, but it might be given on the event of his death; it was also void if given in form on the day before the death of the testator. A legatum could not be left in the way of a penalty (<seg lang="la">poenae nomine</seg>) —that is, for the purpose of compelling the heir to do, or restraining him from doing, any particular act. A legacy could not be left to an uncertain person (<seg lang="la">incerta persona</seg>). The notion of an uncertain person was not of a person who could never be ascertained, but the notion of the uncertainty was referred to the mind of the testator at the time of making his testament. Accordingly, the person was not considered uncertain where he was one of a certain class, such as <seg lang="la">cognati</seg>, though the individual of the class might be uncertain till the event happened <cb /> which was to determine who out of the class was intended by the testator. Such a form of bequest was called a <seg lang="la">certa demonstratio incertae personae.</seg> A legacy could not be left to a <seg lang="la">postumus alienus</seg>, nor could such a person be a <seg lang="la">heres institutus</seg>, for he was an <seg lang="la">incerta persona.</seg> It has been explained elsewhere who is a <seg lang="la">postumus</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstestamentum">Testamentum</ref>); a <seg lang="la">postumus alienus</seg> is one who, when born, cannot be among the <seg lang="la">sui heredes</seg> of the testator.

<div2 id="crosslegatus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Legātus">Legatus</head>

 <p> An envoy from one State to another; an ambassador. (1) Envoys were sent from Rome, in the regal period, by the king; in the republican period by the consuls, with the advice and authority of the Senate. In the later Republic the sending and receiving of <seg lang="la">legati</seg> was practically an exclusive function of the Senate. In the Empire these rights passed to the emperor. In the royal and early Republican periods envoys were always taken from the college of fetial priests. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfetiales">Fetiales</ref>; Ius Fetiale.) When the Senate gained substantial control of foreign affairs, <seg lang="la">legati</seg> were always chosen from the senatorial order. Like the fetials, the secular <seg lang="la">legati</seg> were neutral and inviolable persons (<seg lang="la">iure gentium</seg>). In the last century of the Republic, senators travelling on private business or for pleasure were frequently invested with the character of <seg lang="la">legati</seg> without the least pretence of an actual mission, the appointment assuring them not merely special consideration and protection, but also free transportation at the cost of the State.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Envoys were also sent by the Senate to convey tidings or counsel to magistrates in the field. When an important treaty was to be concluded by such a magistrate, a board of senatorial legati was frequently sent, nominally to advise the general, actually to settle the terms of the treaty. When conquered territory began to be organized into provinces (see <ref type="cross" target="crossprovincia">Provincia</ref>), it became customary to send out one or more senatorial legati with the magistrate to whom the government of a province was intrusted. These legati were legally under the command of the governor, and served as his assistants in military, administrative, and judicial matters; but they also represented the authority of the Senate, and the necessity of hearing their advice operated as a check upon the governor's arbitrary powers. In the last two centuries of the Republic, legati were regularly appointed to accompany consuls or praetors charged with important military operations; and these legates, often nominated by the general in command, served as corps commanders. As the military power began to overshadow that of the Senate, the generals obtained free hand in selecting their legati (cf. the Lex Gabinia, B.C. 66, which gave Pompey the selection of his own legati for the conduct of the war against the pirates), and the way was prepared for the development of the imperial office of <seg lang="la">legatus.</seg> This whole evolution from envoy to officer is indicated, according to Mommsen, in the successive forms of expression: <seg lang="la">legatus ad aliquem, legatus alicui, legatus alicuius.</seg></p>
 <p>The Republican legatus had no <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> and bore no <seg lang="la">fasces.</seg> The symbol and credential of his office was a ring. Here again the Gabinian law marked an innovation: the legati of Pompey had propraetorian powers. The same was true of the legates of Iulius Caesar in Gaul (<title>B. G.</title> i. 21).
 </p>
 <p>(3) In the Early Empire certain provinces were 
<pb n="932" /><cb /> assigned to the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, and these provinces he governed through legati of his own selection. These legates had propraetorian powers and bore <seg lang="la">fasces</seg> (not of twelve or six rods, like the consuls and praetors, but of five—<seg lang="la">legati quinquefascales</seg>). Similar powers and insignia were accorded to the legates in the senatorial provinces, who were now selected by the governor with the approval of the emperor. In the imperial system, accordingly, the <seg lang="la">legati pro praetore</seg> are vice-governors, subordinated in the provinces of Augustus to the emperor and in the other provinces to the senatorial governor. Besides these, the emperors appointed other <seg lang="la">legati pro praetore</seg> without fixed provinces and with purely military duties.</p>
 <p>Still other legates were appointed for the provinces with special military or judicial duties, the <seg lang="la">legati legionis</seg> and the <seg lang="la">legati iuridici.</seg> These had no <seg lang="la">imperium</seg>, and were subordinated to the provincial governors and vice-governors.

 <p>The first and second lines of the legion, drawn up in unbroken order like the Greek phalanx, consisted of citizens of the first class, equipped with helmet, cuirass, round shield (<seg lang="la">clipeus</seg>), and greaves, all of bronze. The third and fourth lines were from the second class, and had no cuirass, but had the helmet and greaves and large oblong shields (<seg lang="la">scutum</seg>). The fifth and sixth were armed similarly, but without greaves, and were drawn from the third class. The fourth class was armed with the <seg lang="la">scutum</seg> as its only weapon of defence, but, like the others, provided with spear (<seg lang="la">hasta</seg>) and sword. It either filled the seventh and eighth lines, or, with the fifth class, formed the <seg lang="la">rorarii</seg>, who opened the battle with slings and other light missiles.</p>
 <p>An important alteration, ascribed to Camillus (about B.C. 390), was the abolition of the phalanx and introduction of the manipular formation, which prevailed till the time of Marius (end of the second century B.C.). In the flourishing days of the Republic, the normal strength of a legion, which could be increased in time of need, consisted of 300 knights (<seg lang="la">equites</seg>) and 4200 foot soldiers (<seg lang="la">pedites</seg>). In respect to the weapons used, the latter were divided into four kinds, according to <cb /> their length of service and familiarity with warfare: (1) 1200 <seg lang="la">hastati</seg>, all in early manhood;</p>
 <p>(2) 1200 <seg lang="la">principes</seg>, in the full vigour of life;</p>
 <p>(3) 600 <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, who were proved veterans; and</p>
 <p>(4) 1200 <seg lang="la">velites</seg>, who were lightly armed, and were drawn from the lowest classes of the census. The first three classes had a bronze helmet (<seg lang="la">cassis</seg>) with a lofty plume of feathers, a <seg lang="la">scutum</seg>, a leathern cuirass (<seg lang="la">lorica</seg>, q. v.), greaves, and a sword (<seg lang="la">gladius</seg>), which, after the Second Punic War, was of the Spanish kind, being short, strong, and two-edged, fitted for thrusting rather than cutting, and worn on the right side. There was also a spear, which in the first two divisions was a <seg lang="la">pilum</seg> (q. v.), and among the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg> a lance (Polyb. vi. 23). The <seg lang="la">velites</seg> were armed with a leather helmet (<seg lang="la">galea</seg>), a light shield (<seg lang="la">parma</seg>), and a sword and several light javelins. The 3000 heavily armed men were divided into 30 <seg lang="la">manipuli</seg>, numbering 120 men each among the <seg lang="la">hastati</seg> and <seg lang="la">principes</seg>, and 60 each among the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, and were again subdivided into two bodies called <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>, and led by centurions (q. v.). Of the 1200 <seg lang="la">velites</seg>, 20 were allotted to each century, and they formed the final complement of each maniple. On the field of battle the maniples were drawn up in open order, separated laterally from one another by intervals corresponding to the breadth of each maniple in front. The arrangement of the maniples would thus resemble that of the black squares on a chess-board. They fell into three divisions—the <seg lang="la">hastati</seg> in the front rank, with the <seg lang="la">principes</seg> behind them, and the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg> in the rear. If the first division, the <seg lang="la">hastati</seg>, were compelled to give way, then the second division, the <seg lang="la">principes</seg>, advanced through the intervals left by the maniples of the first division; if the <seg lang="la">principes</seg>, in their turn, had to retreat, then the third division, the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, who had been previously kneeling, protected by their shields, allowed the <seg lang="la">hastati</seg> and <seg lang="la">principes</seg> to fall back into the intervals separating the maniples of the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, and themselves, closing their ranks, pressed forward to meet the enemy. The 300 knights of the legion were divided into 10 <seg lang="la">turmae</seg> of 30 men each, and were equipped with a bronze cuirass, leathern greaves, helmet, shield, a long sword for attacking, and a long lance provided at both ends with an iron point. Each <seg lang="la">turma</seg> was under three decurions and three under-officers (<seg lang="la">optiones</seg>). The legion, as a whole, was under the command of six <seg lang="la">tribuni militum</seg> (q. v.).</p>
 <p>The consular army consisted of two legions. Four legions were regularly levied in each year; in other words, 16,800 foot soldiers and 1200 cavalry. This levy of citizens was further swelled by the Italian allies (<seg lang="la">socii</seg>), a body of 20,000 foot soldiers and 3600 cavalry, thus adding to each of the two consular armies 10,000 foot soldiers and 1800 cavalry. The former were in twenty cohorts (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscohors">Cohors</ref>), each consisting of 420 men. Ten of these cohorts fought on the right wing and ten on the left wing of the legions. Besides these, four cohorts of 400 men each were formed into a picked body. The cavalry were in six squadrons (<seg lang="la">alae</seg>) of 300 men each. Four of these belonged to the main army, and two to the picked body. In wars beyond the limits of Italy there were also auxiliary forces (<seg lang="la">auxilia</seg>), consisting either of soldiers raised in the country where the war was being carried on, or of light-armed troops furnished by allied kings and nations. Besides the ordinary component parts of the legion there was also the bodyguard of the commander-in-chief, the <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosscohors">Cohors</ref>.
<pb n="933" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the course of the first century B.C. the organization of the legion was essentially altered. In the first place, in the time of Marius, the census ceased to be the basis of the levy, and all the citizens collectively were placed on the same footing in respect to their military service and the uniform which they wore. All the soldiers of the legion alike received the heavy equipment and the <seg lang="la">pilum</seg>, while the light-armed <seg lang="la">velites</seg> were done away with. After the right of citizenship had been conferred on the Italian allies, these no longer formed a separate part of the legions, but were incorporated with them. Thus the Roman army now consisted only of heavy-armed legions and of light-armed auxiliary troops. The latter were partly raised in the provinces and divided into cohorts, and partly enlisted as slingers and archers. The cavalry of the legions ceased to exist. Like the light-armed soldiers, the whole of the cavalry consisted of auxiliary troops, who were partly enlisted and partly levied from the provinces, while some were supplied according to agreement by allied nations and princes. A further important novelty introduced by Marius was the use of the cohort-formation, instead of the maniple-formation, which broke up the front too much. The legion was now divided into ten cohorts, in each of which there were three maniples of <seg lang="la">hastati, principes</seg>, and <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, designations which now only concerned the relative rank of the six centurions of the cohort. The customary battle array was in three divisions, the first being formed of four cohorts, and the second and third of three each. Again, while in earlier times the obligation of service extended at the most in the infantry to twenty campaigns and in the cavalry to ten, from the days of Marius the soldier remained uninterruptedly for twenty years with the army, an earlier dismissal being only exceptional. For this reason the well-to-do classes sought to withdraw themselves from the general military service, and it thus came to pass that the legions were for the greater part manned by means of conscriptions from the lowest ranks of the burgher population of Italy, in which the service was regarded simply as a means of livelihood. Thus from the original army of citizens there was gradually developed a standing army of mercenaries.</p>
 <p>Under the Empire we find what is really a standing army, bound to the emperor by oath. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssacramentum">Sacramentum</ref>.) Apart from the legions this army consisted of the <seg lang="la">auxilia</seg> (q. v.), the guards stationed in Rome and the neighbourhood (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspraetoriani">Praetoriani</ref>), and the city-cohorts (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscohors">Cohors</ref>), the artillery and the corps of workmen (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfabri">Fabri</ref>), the marines (see <ref type="cross" target="crossclassiarii">Classiarii</ref>), and the municipal and provincial militia. The legions are now once more provided with a corps of cavalry 120 strong, and are designated not only by numbers, but also by distinctive names. Together with the auxiliary troops they form the garrison of the imperial provinces under the command of the imperial <seg lang="la">legati legionum</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslegatus">Legati</ref>), whose place was taken in the middle of the third century A.D. by the <seg lang="la">praefecti legionum.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspraefecti">Praefecti</ref>.) The strength of the legion now amounted to 5000-6000 men, raised partly by a regular levy, partly by drawing recruits from the Roman citizens of all the provinces beyond the bounds of Italy. As under the Republic, <cb /> it was divided into 10 cohorts of 6 centuries each; the first cohort was, however, twice the strength of the remainder. It was not until the second half of the third century A.D. that a new division of the 10 cohorts into 55 centuries came into use, with 10 centuries in the first cohort, and 5 in each of the rest. At the death of Augustus, the number of the legions was 25; it was then increased to 30, and this number was maintained until the end of the second century, when three new legions were added by Septimius Severus. From the beginning of the fourth century it gradually rose to about 175, each of them, however, mustering a considerably smaller contingent. In course of time, and especially after the second century, owing to the conflicts with the barbarians, the legion was drawn up more and more after the manner of the Greek phalanx, without intervals in its line and with a division of troops in its rear. In its equipment there was an important alteration beginning with the second half of the third century, when all the soldiers of the legion carried long swords (<seg lang="la">spathae</seg>), and the first five cohorts two <seg lang="la">pila</seg>, one larger and another smaller, while the last five had <seg lang="la">lanceae</seg>, or javelins serving as missiles, and fitted with a leather loop to help in hurling them with precision.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λέλεγες</foreign>). An ancient race, frequently mentioned with the Pelasgians as the prehistoric inhabitants of Greece.

Piracy was probably their chief occupation; and they are represented as the ancestors of the Teleboans and the Taphians, who were notorious for their piracies. The name of the Leleges was derived by the Greeks from an ancestor, Lelex, who is called king of either Megaris or Lacedaemon (Pausan. iii. 1, 1). They must be regarded as a branch of the great Indo-Germanic race, who became gradually incorporated with the Hellenes, and thus ceased to exist as an independent people. They are spoken of as inhabiting Acarnania and Aetolia, and afterwards Phocis, Locris, Boeotia, Megaris, Elis, and Laconia, which last was originally called Lelegia; also (in Asia Minor) Ionia, the southern part of the Troad, and Caria ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 171" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 171</bibl>).

Its area is about 180 square miles. It was sacred to Hephaestus, who is said to have fallen here when he was hurled down from Olympus. Hence the workshop of the god is sometimes placed in this island. The legend appears to have arisen from the volcanic nature of Lemnos. Its earliest inhabitants, according to Homer, were the Thracian Sinties, a name which probably signifies “robbers,” from <foreign lang="greek">σίνομαι</foreign>. When the Argonauts landed at Lemnos, they found it inhabited only by women who had murdered all their husbands, and had selected Hypsipylé as their queen. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshypsipyle">Hypsipylé</ref>.) By the Lemnian women some of the Argonauts became the fathers of the Minyae, who inhabited the island till they were expelled by the Pelasgians.

 <p> The spectres or spirits of the dead.

But the common idea was that the Lemures and Larvae were the same. They were said to wander about at night as spectres, and to torment and frighten the living. In order to propitiate them, the Romans celebrated the festival of the Lemuralia or Lemuria in the month of May (the 9th, 11th, and 13th). It was said to have been originally instituted by Romulus to appease the spirit of Remus (Ovid, <title>Fast</title>, v. 473, etc.). At this festival it was the custom to appease or expel the evil spirits by walking barefoot and throwing black beans over the shoulder at night (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, v. 473 foll.). Because of this festival to the dead, the whole month of May was supposed to be unlucky

 <p> A haughty patrician family of the Cornelia gens ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> iii. 7), of which the most important persons were: (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Lentulus Sura</hi>, the person of chief note among Catiline's conspirators. He was quaestor to B.C. 81; praetor in 75; consul in 71. In the next year he was ejected from the Senate, with sixtythree others, for infamous life and manners. It was this, probably, that led him to join Catiline and his band. From his distinguished birth and high rank, he calculated on becoming chief of the conspiracy; and a prophecy of the Sibylline Books was applied by flattering haruspices to him. Three Cornelii were to rule Rome, and he was the third after Sulla and Cinna ; the twentieth year after the burning of the Capitol, etc., was to be fatal to the city. To gain power and recover his place in the Senate, he became praetor again in 63. When Catiline quitted the city for Etruria, Lentulus was left as chief of the home conspirators, and his irresolution probably saved the city from being fired; for it was by his over-caution that the negotiation with the ambassadors of the Allobroges was entered into, and these unstable allies revealed the secret to the consul Cicero. The sequel will be found in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscatilina">Catilina</ref>. Lentulus was deposed from the praetorship, and was strangled in the Capitoline prison on the 5th of December.</p>

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Diacŏnus</hi>, or the Deacon, a Byzantine historian of the tenth century. His history, in ten books, includes the period from the Cretan expedition of Nicephorus Phocas, in the reign of the emperor Romanus II. (A.D. 959), to the death of Ioannes I. Zimisces (975). The style of Leo is corrupt; he employs unusual and inappropriate words, many of them borrowed from Homer, Agiathias the historian, and the Septuagint, in the place of common ones; and he abounds in tautological phrases. His history, however, is a valuable contemporary record of a stirring time, honestly and fearlessly written. It is edited by Migne <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1863)</bibl>.</p>

 <p>(6) Leo was also the name of six Byzantine emperors. Of these, Leo VI., “the philosopher,” who reigned 886-911, is celebrated in the history of the later Greek literature. He wrote a treatise on Greek tactics, and several other works, which are still extant. He is also celebrated in the history of legislation. As the Latin language had long ceased to be the official language of the Eastern Empire, Basil, the father of Leo, had formed and partly executed the plan of issuing an authorized Greek version of Iustinian's legislation. This plan was carried out by Leo. The Greek version is known under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Βασιλικαὶ Διατάξεις</foreign>, or shortly, <foreign lang="greek">Βασιλικαί</foreign>; in Latin, <title>Basilica</title>, which means “Imperial Constitutions,” or “Laws.” See <ref type="cross" target="crossbasilica">Basilica</ref>.

 <p> A name given especially to a form of the Latin hexameter and pentameter rhymed in the middle and at the end. They are ascribed to Leoninus, Canon of the Church of St. Victor in Paris about the middle of the twelfth century, and by some to Pope Leo II.; but they occur in the classical Latin writers of the Augustan Age. Such is the line of Vergil: <lb />“Limus ut hic durescit et haec ut cera liquescit;”</p>
 <p>and this from Ovid: <lb />“Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas.”</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages, however, they were systematically written and chiefly by poets who let their rhyme take the place of syllabic quantity. Many famous old couplets are leonine. Such is the original of “When the devil was ill,” etc.— <lb />“Daemon languebat, monachus tunc esse volebat: <lb />Ast ubi convaluit, mansit ut ante fuit.”</p>
 <p>And the famous epitaph of Bede in Durham Cathedral: <lb />“Hac sunt in fossa, Bedae venerabilis ossa.”</p>
 <p>And this skit on the legal profession: <lb />“Dirue iuristas, Deus, ut Satanae citharistas; <lb />O Deus extingues hos pingues atque bilingues!”</p>
 <p>And the punning line on the Fair Rosamond: <lb />“Hic iacet in hac tumba rosa mundi non rosa munda.”</p>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius Aemilius Paulus</hi>, brother of M. Lepidus, the triumvir. His surname of Paulus was probably given him by his father, in honour of the celebrated Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia; but since he belonged to the family of the Lepidi, and not to that of the Pauli, he is mentioned in this place and not under the title <ref type="cross" target="crosspaulus">Paulus</ref>. Aemilius Paulus commenced his public career by supporting the aristocratic party. His first public act was the accusation of Catiline in B.C. 63. He was quaestor in Macedonia in 59; aedile, 55; praetor, 53; and consul, 50, with M. Claudius Marcellus. Paulus was raised to the consulship, on account of his being one of the most determined enemies of Caesar, but Caesar gained him over to his side by a bribe of 1500 talents, which he is said to have expended on the completion of a magnificent basilica commenced by him in his aedileship. After the murder of Caesar (B.C. 44), Paulus joined the senatorial party. He was one of the senators who declared M. Lepidus a public enemy, on account of his having joined Antony; and, accordingly, when the Second Triumvirate was formed, his name was set down first in the proscription list by his own brother. The soldiers, however, who had been ordered to kill him, allowed him to escape. He passed over to Brutus in Asia, and after the death of the latter repaired to Miletus, where he remained, and refused to go to Rome, although he was pardoned by the triumvirs.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Aemilius</hi>, the triumvir, son of the M. Lepidus, consul B.C. 78, who took up arms to rescind the laws of Sulla , but was defeated by Pompey and Catulus. The son was praetor in 49, and supported Caesar in the Civil War. In 46 he was consul with Caesar, and in 44 he received from the latter the government of Narbonese Gaul and Nearer Spain. He was in the neighbourhood of Rome at the time of the dictator's death; and having the command of an army, he was able to render M. Antony efficient assistance. Lepidus was now chosen pontifex maximus, which dignity had become vacant by Caesar's death, and then repaired to his provinces of Gaul and Spain. Antony, after his defeat at Mutina (43), fled to Lepidus, who espoused his cause against the Senate. They crossed the Alps at the head of a powerful army, and were joined in the north of Italy by Octavian (afterwards Augustus). In the month of October the celebrated Second Triumvirate was formed, by which the Roman world was divided between Augustus, Antony, and Lepidus. In the fresh division of the provinces after the battle of Philippi (42), Lepidus received Africa, where he remained till 36. In this year Augustus summoned him to Sicily to assist him in the war against <cb /> Sex. Pompey. Lepidus obeyed; but, tired of being treated as a subordinate, he resolved to make an effort to acquire Sicily for himself. He was easily subdued by Augustus, who spared his life, but deprived him of his triumvirate, his army, and his provinces; and commanded that he should live at <figure id="fig.00937">

<head orig="Lesches">Lesches</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λέσχης</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Lescheus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Λέσχευς</foreign>). A Cyclic poet, a native of Mitylené or Pyrrha, in the island of Lesbos, and considerably later than Arctinus. The best authorities concur in placing him in the time of Archilochus, or about B.C. 708-676. Hence the account which we find in ancient authors, of a contest between Arctinus and Lesches, can only mean that the latter competed with the <cb /> earlier poet in treating the same subjects. His poem, in four books, which was attributed by many to Homer, and, besides, to very different authors, was called the “Little Iliad” (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰλιὰς Μικρά</foreign>), and was clearly intended as a supplement to the great <title>Iliad.</title> It is learned from Aristotle (<title>Poët.</title> 23) that it comprised the events before the fall of Troy, the fate of Aiax, the exploits of Philoctetes, Neoptolemus, and Odysseus, which led to the taking of the city, as well as the account of the destruction of Troy itself; which statement is confirmed by numerous fragments. The last part of this (like the first part of the poem of Arctinus) was called the “Destruction of Troy” (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰλίου Πέρσις</foreign>), from which Pausanias makes several quotations with reference to the sacking of Troy and the partition and carrying away of the prisoners.

<div2 id="crossleto" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Leto">Leto</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λητώ</foreign>), called by the Romans <hi rend="bold">Latōna.</hi> According to Hesiod, a daughter of the Titan Coeus and Phoebé, a sister of Asteria. She was the mother of Apollo and Artemis by Zeus, to whom she was married before Heré. Homer likewise calls her the mother of Apollo and Artemis by Zeus; he mentions her in the story of Niobé, who paid so dearly for her conduct towards Leto, and he also describes her as the friend of the Trojans in the war with the Greeks. In later writers these elements of her story are variously embellished, for they do not describe her as the lawful wife of Zeus, but merely as his mistress, who was persecuted by Heré during her pregnancy. All the world being afraid of receiving Leto on account of their dread of Heré, she wandered about till she came to Delos, which was then a floating island, and bore the name of Asteria or Ortygia. When Leto arrived there, Zeus fastened it by adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea, that it might be a secure resting-place for his beloved, and here she gave birth to Apollo and Artemis. The tradition is also related with various other modifications. Some said that Zeus changed Leto into a quail (<foreign lang="greek">ὄρτυξ</foreign>), and that in this state she arrived in the floating island, which was hence called Ortygia. Others related that Zeus was enamoured of Asteria, but that she, being metamorphosed into a bird, flew across the sea; that she was then changed into a rock, which, for a long time, lay under the surface of the sea; and that this rock arose from the waters and received Leto when she was pursued by Python. Leto was generally worshipped only in conjunction with her children. Delos was the chief seat of her worship, and in the sanctuary devoted to her honour she was represented by a shapeless wooden image. See <ref type="cross" target="crossapollo">Apollo</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedala">Daedala</ref>.</p>
 <p>It is probable that the name of Leto belongs to the same class of words as the Greek <foreign lang="greek">λήθη</foreign> and the <seg lang="la">lateo</seg>, as typifying night. Leto would therefore signify “the obscure” or “concealed,” not as a physical power, but as a divinity yet quiescent and invisible, from whom issued the visible divinity with all his splendour and brilliancy. This view is supported by the account of her genealogy 
<pb n="939" /><cb /> given by Hesiod. (See Preller, <title>Röm. Myth.</title> i. 190; Lang, <title>Myth, Ritual</title>, etc., ii. 199.)

<head orig="Leucas">Leucas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λευκάς</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">πέτρα</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Leucadia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Λευκαδία</foreign>). The modern Santa Maura. An island in the Ionian Sea, off the western coast of Acarnania, about twenty miles in length and from five to eight miles in breadth. It derived its name from the numerous calcareous hills which cover its surface. It was originally united to the mainland at its northeastern extremity by a narrow isthmus. Homer speaks of it as a peninsula, and mentions its well-fortified town Nericus. It was at that time inhabited by the Teleboans and Leleges. Subsequently the Corinthians under Cypselus, between B.C. 665 and 625, founded a new town called Leucas. They also cut a canal through the isthmus, and thus converted the peninsula into an island. This canal was afterwards filled up by deposits of sand, but was opened again by the Romans. At present the channel is dry in some parts, and has from three to four feet of water in others. During the war between Philip and the Romans, Leucas was the place where the meetings of the Acarnanian League were held. The other towns of the island were Hellomenum and Phara.</p>
 <p>At the southern extremity of the island, opposite Cephallenia, was the celebrated promontory, variously called <ref type="cross" target="crossleucas">Leucas</ref>, Leucātas, Leucātes, or <ref type="cross" target="crossleucate">Leucāté</ref>, on which was a temple of Apollo Leucadius. At the annual festival of the god it was the custom to cast down a criminal from this promontory into the sea; birds were attached to him in order to break his fall; and if he reached the sea uninjured, boats were ready to pick him up. This appears to have been an expiatory rite; and it gave rise to the well-known story that lovers leaped from this rock in order to seek relief from the pangs of love. Thus Sappho is said to have leaped down from this rock when in love with Phaon. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssappho">Sappho</ref>.

<head orig="Lex">Lex</head>

 <p> (1) A statute; a rule of law (<seg lang="la">ius</seg>) laid down by some authorized organ of the State. In the royal period the kings are said to have exercised legislative power (whether the assent of the Comitia Curiata was required, is disputed; cf. Dionysius, 4, 13; <title>Dig.</title> 1, 2, 2. 1, 2); but the so-called <seg lang="la">leges regiae</seg> seems to be mainly rules of the old religious law formulated by the priests. A collection of the <seg lang="la">leges regiae</seg>, made towards the end of the Republic by Sextus Papirius, was called, from its editor, the <title>ius Papirianum </title> (<title>Dig.</title> 1, 2, 2. 2; 50, 16, 144). With the establishment of the Republic the initiative in legislation passed to the magistrates, but their proposals (<seg lang="la">rogationes</seg>) required the assent of the Comitia Centuriata (<seg lang="la">uti rogas</seg>=yes; <seg lang="la">antiquo</seg>=no). All the earlier leges of the Republic, including the Twelve Tables, were thus enacted. The tribunes might similarly propose bills to the assembly of the <seg lang="la">plebs;</seg> but these, if ratified (<hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi>), originally bound the plebeians only. By a <title>lex Hortensia</title> (B.C. 286) <hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi> became binding on the whole people, and the Comitia Tributa thus obtained concurrent legislative power. In the last centuries of the Republic the <hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi> were more numerous and more important than the leges voted by the Comitia Centuriata. Within the limits of their respective powers, resolves of the Senate and edicts of the magistrates had also the force of laws. In the Empire all legislative power was practically vested from the outset (by the <seg lang="la">lex de imperio</seg>, also called <seg lang="la">lex regia</seg>) in the emperor. Bills were still submitted by Augustus to the popular assembly and by his successors to the Senate; but the imperial measures were invariably approved, and the jurists often cited laws voted by the Senate not as <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg>, but as <seg lang="la">orationes principis.</seg> The emperors had also the full <seg lang="la">ius edicendi</seg>, or right of issuing edicts, which had been exercised by the republican magistrates. As late as the third century, however, the jurists confined the term <seg lang="la">leges</seg>, in the stricter sense, to the enactments of the Comitia Centuriata, distinguishing between these and all other forms of law (cf. Gaius Iust. i. 5; <title>Dig.</title> 1, 1, 7, pr.; 1, 4, 1, pr.). In a wider sense <title>plebiscita, Senatus consulta, edicta praetorum</title>, and <seg lang="la">constitutiones principum</seg> were all termed <seg lang="la">leges</seg> (cf. <title>Dig.</title> 9, 2, 1. 1; 14, 6, 9. 4; 38, 8, 1. 2; 1, 4, 1. 1). In the later Empire <seg lang="la">leges</seg> designated primarily the imperial constitutions, all the earlier statutes having become a part of the <seg lang="la">ius</seg> (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossius">Ius</ref> [1]). A complete collection of all the older leges and fragments of leges that have come down to us in texts or inscriptions (including reconstructions of the <seg lang="la">leges regiae</seg> and the Twelve Tables) is to be found in Bruns and Mommsen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Fontes Iuris Romani Antiqui</title> (5th ed. 1887)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) In a looser sense any rule of law, even of customary origin, is occasionally termed <seg lang="la">lex</seg> (cf. <title>Dig.</title> 1, 5, 24; 1, 3, 32. 1); and in the later imperial constitutions <seg lang="la">leges</seg> is occasionally used in a collective sense, as equivalent to <seg lang="la">ius</seg> or the whole body of the law (so <seg lang="la">legum scientia, legum prudentes</seg>).</p>
 <p>(3)  <title>Lex</title>was also used, from the earliest period, to denote the rule which private persons impose upon themselves and their successors by contracts or other legal acts. So <seg lang="la">lex contractus </seg> (<title>Dig.</title> 16, 3, 24), <seg lang="la">lex donationis </seg> (<hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 1, 5, 22), for the provisions or conditions of a contract, gift, etc., <cb /> and <seg lang="la">legum testamento dicere </seg> (<hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 28, 1, 14). <title>Lex commissoria</title> was a clause in a contract by which one of the parties reserved the right of annulling the contract. So in sales it was frequently agreed that if the price were not paid at a certain time <seg lang="la">res inempta fuerit.</seg> In mortgages <seg lang="la">lex commissoria</seg> was an agreement that if the debtor failed to pay at a stipulated time the mortgagee need not sell the property and account for any surplus, but might simply appropriate it. Such an agreement Constantine declared null.</p>

 <p>ATILIA. See Iulia Lex et Titia; <ref type="cross" target="crosstutor">Tutor</ref>.</p>
 <p>ATINIA (of perhaps B.C. 198), allowed no usucapion in a stolen thing. See <ref type="cross" target="crossusucapio">Usucapio</ref>.</p>
 <p>ATINIA, of uncertain date, was a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> which gave the rank of senator to a tribune. The measure perhaps originated with C. Atinius, who was tribune B.C. 130 ( <bibl n="Gel.  14. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiv. 8</bibl>).</p>

 <p>BAEBIA (B.C. 192), enacted that four praetors and six praetors should be chosen alternately; but the law was not observed (Livy , xl. 44).</p>
 <p>CAECILIA DE CENSŌRIBUS or CENSORIA (B.C. 52), proposed by Metellus Scipio, repealed a <title>Clodia lex</title> (B.C. 58) which had prescribed certain regular forms of proceeding for the censors in exercising their functions as inspectors of morals, and had required the concurrence of both censors to inflict the <seg lang="la">nota censoria.</seg> When a senator had been already convicted before an ordinary court, the law permitted the censors to remove him from the Senate in a summary way.</p>
 <p>CAECILIA DE VECTIGALIBUS (B.C. 62), released lands and harbours in Italy from the payment of taxes and dues (<seg lang="la">portoria</seg>).

 <p>There were various Gabinian laws, some of which were <seg lang="la">privilegia</seg>, as that for conferring extraordinary power on Cn. Pompeius for conducting the war against the pirates.</p>
 <p>A Gabinian law (B.C. 58) forbade all loans of money at Rome to <seg lang="la">legationes</seg> from foreign parts (<title>Salaminii cum Romae versuram facere vellent, non poterant, quod lex Gabinia vetabat</title>). The object of the law was to prevent money being borrowed for the purpose of bribing the senators at Rome.</p>
 <p>GELLIA CORNELIA (B.C. 72), which gave to Cn. Pompeius the extraordinary power of conferring Roman citizenship on Spaniards in Spain, with the advice of his council (<seg lang="la">de consilii sententia</seg>).</p>
 <p>GENUCIA (B.C. 343) forbade altogether the taking of interest for the use of money. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfenus">Fenus</ref>. <cb /></p>
 <p>HIERONICA was not a law properly so called.

 <p>HORTENSIA DE PLEBISCĪTIS. See <ref type="cross" target="crossplebiscitum">Plebiscitum</ref>.</p>
 <p>Another <title>lex Hortensia</title> enacted that the <seg lang="la">nundinae</seg>, which had hitherto been <seg lang="la">feriae</seg>, should be <seg lang="la">dies fasti.</seg> This was done for the purpose of accommodating the inhabitants of the country.</p>
 <p>ICILIA (B.C. 456), by which the Aventine Hill was assigned to the plebs as a dwelling-place. This was the first instance of the public land being assigned to the plebs.</p>
 <p>Another <title>lex Icilia</title>, proposed by the tribune Sp. Icilius, B.C. 469, had for its object to prevent all interruption to the tribunes while acting in the discharge of their duties. In some cases the penalty was death.</p>
 <p>IULIAE. Most of these were passed in the time of Iulius Caesar and Augustus. The following are the most important:</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Agraria</hi> (B.C. 59), providing for the assignment of lands in Campania to the veterans of Pompey and to poor citizens, especially to those who had three children.</p>

On one side is a Greek <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign> of the town of Heraclea; on the other is a part of a Roman law containing various police regulations of the city of Rome, and rules for the constitution of colonies, muncipalities, etc. A lithographed copy of the table is given by Ritschl, tab. xxxiii., xxxiv. For the text, see <bibl default="NO">Spangenberg's <title>Monumenta Legalia</title> (1830)</bibl>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Iulia et Papia Poppaea</hi>. Augustus appears in his sixth consulate (B.C. 28) to have issued an edict ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 28</bibl>) on the subject of marriage, which he followed up (B.C. 18) by proposing a law to the Senate regulating certain marriages, imposing disabilities on unmarried persons (<hi rend="italic">caelibes</hi>), and establishing rewards for those who had married and reared children (Dio Cass. liv. 16). This he carried, with difficulty, through the Senate; but, apparently owing to the organized resistance of the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, it was rejected at the Comitia ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>34</bibl>). Towards the end of his reign, however (A.D. 3), 
<pb n="943" /><cb /> he succeeded in passing it, with its rewards increased and its penalties mitigated; it is referred to in the <title>Carmen Saeculare</title> of Horace, which was written B.C. 17, and is mentioned under the name <title>lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus</title> in <title>Dig.</title> 38, 11; 23, 2. The opposition of the knights was overcome by a provision that it should not come into force for three, a period subsequently extended to six, years; and taking advantage of this, Augustus passed, in A.D. 9, another statute (called Papia Poppaea from the <seg lang="la">consules suffecti</seg> for the year, M. Papius Mutilus and Q. Poppaeus Secundus: Dio Cass. lvi. 1-10), containing further enactments on the same subject. Sometimes they are cited by reference to their various chapters—e. g. <title>lex Caducaria, lex Decimaria, lex Miscella</title>, etc.</p>
 <p>Many commentaries were written on these laws by the Roman jurists, of which considerable fragments are preserved in the Digest. Gaius wrote fifteen books, Ulpian twenty, and Paulus at least ten. The joint statute contained at least thirtyfive chapters (<title>Dig.</title> 22, 2, 19); but, as a rule, it is impossible to say to which of the two laws, included under the general title of <title lang="la">lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea</title>, the several provisions, as now known to us, belong.</p>
 <p>Among the enactments of these statutes are the following:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Prohibition of certain marriages under penalties: viz. of <seg lang="la">ingenui</seg> and <seg lang="la">infames</seg> (e. g. actresses and prostitutes); and of senators or their children with freed women, freedmen, and actors' daughters. Marriages between a senator or his issue and <seg lang="la">libertini</seg> were declared void by a <seg lang="la">senatus consult</seg> passed under M. Aurelius, and the rule was subsequently extended to actors and actresses (<title>Dig.</title> 42, 1).</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Avoidance of conditions against marriage annexed to legacies and inheritances.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Provisions to encourage marriage. <title>Caelibes</title> were disabled by the <title>lex Iulia</title> from taking either as heirs or as legatees under a will, unless the testator was related to them within the sixth degree, or unless they married within 100 days. <title>Spadones</title> and Vestal Virgins were exempted from the operation of the statute, as were widows for twelve months, and divorced women for six. Again, the penalty of the statute could be evaded by an engagement to marry, if carried out within two years ( <bibl n="Sen.  Oct. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oct.</title>34</bibl>). Finally, males were released from its provisions in this respect on attaining sixty, women on attaining fifty years of age; but a <title>senatus consultum Persicianum</title>, passed under Tiberius, enacted that they should be regarded as <hi rend="italic">caelibes</hi> in perpetuity if they postponed marrying till so late in life. A <title>senatus consultum Claudianum</title> so far modified the strictness of the new rule as to give a man who married after sixty the same advantage that he would have had if he had married under sixty, provided he married a woman who was under fifty; but it was enacted by a <title>senatus consultum Calvisianum</title> under Nero, that if a woman over fifty married a husband under sixty, even the latter should not escape the disabilities imposed by the statute. Similarly, by the <title>lex Papia, orbi</title> (persons who had married, but had no children living) were disqualified from taking more than half of what was left them by way of either inheritance or legacy, unless related to the testator within the sixth degree. Males escaped the penalties of <seg lang="la">orbitas</seg> by having a single (even adoptive) child (Iuv. xix. 83, 86-89), but by a <seg lang="la">senatus consultum Memmianum</seg> <cb /> adoption was deprived of this effect when resorted to merely in order to evade the statute; but women were not so well off, <seg lang="la">ingenuae</seg> being released only by three, <seg lang="la">libertinae</seg> only by four children. There were exceptions to these rules if the wife was under twenty or over fifty, or the husband under twenty-five or over sixty, and also if the husband was residing away from the wife <seg lang="la">reipublicae causa.</seg> Legacies and inheritances which could not be taken either in whole or part, owing to these provisions of the <title>lex Iulia</title> or <title>lex Papia Poppaea</title>, became <seg lang="la">caduca</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbona-caduca">Bona Caduca</ref>), the law upon which subject was considerably modified by these statutes.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Among other provisions may be noticed the rule giving a preference to candidates for office according to the number of their children; the release of <seg lang="la">ingenuae</seg> with three and <seg lang="la">libertinae</seg> with four children from tutela; and of <seg lang="la">libertini</seg> with a certain number of children from <seg lang="la">operarum obligationes </seg> (<title>Dig.</title> 38, 1). The exemption of persons from discharging the office of tutor or curator <seg lang="la">iure liberorum</seg> was based on these statutes.</p>
 <p>After the enactment of the <title>lex Papia Poppaea</title>, it became not unusual to obtain a grant of a fictitious <seg lang="la">ius liberorum</seg> by special favour from the Senate, and later from the emperor, whereby those who had no children, or not enough, were enabled to escape its disabilities and even enjoy most of its benefits. This privilege is mentioned in some inscriptions, on which the abbreviation I. L. H. (<seg lang="la">ius liberorum habens</seg>) sometimes occurs. The emperor Marcus Aurelius enacted that children should be registered by name within thirty days of their birth with the Praefectus Aerarii Saturni.</p>
 <p>The penalties of <seg lang="la">caelibatus</seg> and <seg lang="la">orbitas</seg> were abolished by Constantine and his sons, and little is left of these statutes in the law of Justinian.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Iulia et Titia</hi> (about B.C. 31), assigning to the <seg lang="la">praesides</seg> of provinces the duty of appointing guardians for women and <hi rend="italic">impaberes</hi> who were not in <seg lang="la">patria potestate</seg>, or already provided with one.</p>

 <p>IUNIA DE PEREGRĪNIS, proposed B.C. 126 by M. Iunius Pennus, a tribune, banished <seg lang="la">peregrini</seg> from the city.</p>
 <p>A law of C. Fannius, consul, B.C. 122, contained the same provisions respecting the Latini and Italici; and a law of C. Papius, perhaps B.C. 65, contained the same respecting all persons who were not domiciled in Italy.</p>
 <p>IUNIA LICINIA. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Licinia Iunia</hi>, below.</p>
 <p>IUNIA NORBĀNA, of uncertain date, but probably about A.D. 19, enacted that when a Roman citizen had manumitted a slave without the requisite formalities, the manumission should not in all cases be ineffectual, but the manumitted person should have the status of a Latinus. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslatinitas">Latinitas</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslibertus">Libertus</ref>.</p>
 <p>IUNIA REPETUNDĀRUM. See <ref type="cross" target="crossrepetundarum-crimen">Repetundae</ref>.</p>
 <p>IUNIA VELLĒIA (A.D. 10) allowed a <seg lang="la">posthumus</seg> to be instituted <seg lang="la">heres</seg>, if he should be born in the life-time of the testator. It also so far modified the old law that a person who, by the death of a 
<pb n="944" /><cb /> <seg lang="la">heres institutus</seg>, after the testator had made his will, became a <seg lang="la">heres quasi agnascendo</seg>, did not break the will if he was instituted <seg lang="la">heres.</seg></p>
 <p>LAETORIA. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurator">Curator</ref>.</p>
 <p>Sometimes the law proposed by Volero for electing plebeian magistrates at the Comitia Tributa is cited as a lex Laetoria (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 56</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  57" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 57</bibl>).</p>
 <p>LICINIA DE SODALICIIS. See <ref type="cross" target="crossambitus">Ambitus</ref>.</p>
 <p>LICINIA IUNIA or, as it is sometimes called, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iunia et Licinia</hi>, passed in the consulship of L. Licinius Murena and Iunius Silanus, B.C. 62, enforced the Caecilia Didia, in connection with which it is sometimes mentioned.</p>
 <p>LICINIA MUCIA DE CIVIBUS REGUNDIS, passed in the consulship of L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola, B.C. 95, which enacted a strict examination as to the title to citizenship, and deprived of the exercise of civic rights all those who could not make out a good title to them. This measure partly led to the Marsic War.</p>

 <p>LICINIAE ROGATIŌNES. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Rogationes Liciniae</hi>.</p>
 <p>LIVIAE were various enactments proposed by the tribune M. Livius Drusus, B.C. 91, for establishing colonies in Italy and Sicily, distributing corn among the poor citizens at a low rate, and admitting the <seg lang="la">foederatae civitates</seg> to Roman citizenship. He is also said to have been the mover of a law for adulterating silver by mixing with it an eighth part of brass. Drusus was assassinated, and the Senate declared that all his laws were passed contrary to the auspices, and were therefore not at all.</p>
 <p>MAENIA LEX is only mentioned by Cicero, who says that M. Curius compelled the patres <seg lang="la">ante auctores fieri</seg>, in the case of the election of a plebeian consul, “which,” adds Cicero, “was a great thing to accomplish, as the <title>lex Maenia</title> was not yet passed.” The law, therefore, required the <seg lang="la">patres</seg> to give their consent, at least to the election of a magistrate; or, in other words, to confer, or agree to confer, the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> on the person whom the Comitia should elect. It was probably proposed by the tribune Maenius, B.C. 287.</p>
 <p>MAIESTĀTIS. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmaiestas">Maiestas</ref>.</p>
 <p>MANILIA, proposed by the tribune C. Manilius, B.C. 66, was a <seg lang="la">privilegium</seg>, by which was conferred on Pompey the command in the war against Mithridates. The law was supported by Cicero when praetor. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspompeius">Pompeius</ref>.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Leges Maniliānae</hi>, mentioned by Cicero, were evidently not leges proper, but probably forms which it was prudent for parties to observe in buying and selling.</p>
 <p>MANLIA, also called LICINIA (B.C. 196), created the <seg lang="la">triumviri epulones.</seg></p>

 <p>MENSIA. This law enacted that if a woman who was a Roman citizen (<title>civis Romana</title>) married a <seg lang="la">peregrinus</seg>, the offspring was a <seg lang="la">peregrinus.</seg> If there was <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> between the <seg lang="la">peregrinus</seg> and the woman, the children, according to the principle of <seg lang="la">conubium</seg>, were <seg lang="la">peregrini</seg>, as the legal effect <cb /> of <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> was that children followed the condition of their father (<seg lang="la">liberi semper patrem sequuntur</seg>). If there were no <seg lang="la">conubium</seg>, the children, according to another rule of law, by which they followed the condition of the mother, would have been Roman citizens; and it was the object of the law to prevent this.</p>
 <p>MINUCIA (B.C. 46) created the <seg lang="la">triumviri mensarii.</seg></p>
 <p>MUNERĀLIS. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cincia; Iuliae</hi>, above.</p>
 <p>OGULNIA, proposed by the tribunes B.C. 300, increased the number of pontifices to eight and that of the augurs to nine; it also enacted that four of the pontifices and five of the augurs should be taken from the plebeians.</p>

 <p>OVINIA, of uncertain date, was a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi>, which gave the censors certain powers in regulating the lists of the senators (<seg lang="la">ordo senatorius</seg>); the main object seems to have been to exclude all improper persons from the Senate, and to prevent their admission, if in other respects qualified.</p>

 <p>PAPIA POPPAEA. See <ref type="cross" target="crossiuliae-leges">Iuliae Leges</ref>.</p>
 <p>A <title>lex Papia</title> on the manner of choosing the Vestal Virgins is mentioned by Gellius; but the reading appears to be doubtful, and perhaps it ought to be called <title>lex Popilia</title> ( <bibl n="Gel.  1. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.i. 12</bibl>).</p>
 <p>PAPIRIA or IULIA PAPIRIA DE MULTĀRUM AESTIMATIŌNE (B.C. 430) fixed a money value, as an equivalent for fines, which formerly were paid in sheep and cattle. Gellius and Festus make this valuation part of the Athenian law.</p>
 <p>PAPIRIA (B.C. 89), by which the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> was made <seg lang="la">semuncialis</seg>, one of the various enactments which tampered with the coinage.</p>
 <p>PAPIRIA (B.C. 332), proposed by the praetor Papirius, gave the Acerrani the <seg lang="la">civitas</seg> without the <seg lang="la">suffragium.</seg> It was properly a <seg lang="la">privilegium</seg>, but is useful as illustrating the history of the extension of the <title>civitas Romana.</title></p>
 <p>PAPIRIA (B.C. 303) enacted that no <seg lang="la">aedes</seg> should be consecrated without a <title>plebiscitum (iniussu Plebis).</title></p>
 <p>PAPIRIA PLAUTIA, a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> of the year B.C. 89, enacted that all citizens and inhabitants of <seg lang="la">foederatae civitalis</seg> (q. v.) who at the date of the statute were domiciled in Italy should be qualified to obtain Roman citizenship on giving in their names to the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> within sixty days ( <title>Pro Archia</title>, 4, 7).</p>

 <p>PEDUCAEA (B.C. 114), a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi>, seems to have been merely a <seg lang="la">privilegium</seg> relating to Vestal Virgins, and not a general law against incest.</p>
 <p>PESULANIA provided that if an animal did any damage, the owner should make it good or give up the animal. There was a general provision to this effect in the Twelve Tables, and it might be inferred from Paulus that this law extended the provisions of the old law to dogs.</p>
 <p>PETRĒIA, a law under this title, <hi rend="SmallCaps">De Decimatiōne Milĭtum</hi>, in case of mutiny, is mentioned by Appian. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecimatio">Decimatio</ref>.</p>
 <p>PETRONIA, probably passed in the reign of Augustus, and subsequently amended by various <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg>, forbade a master to deliver up 
<pb n="945" /><cb />
 his slave to fight with wild beasts. If, however, the master thought that his slave deserved such a punishment, he might take him before the authorities (<seg lang="la">iudex</seg>), who might condemn him to fight if he appeared to deserve it.</p>

 <p>POMPĒIAE. There were various leges so called:</p>
 <p><ref type="cross" target="crosspompeia">Pompēia</ref>, proposed by Cn. Pompeins Strabo, the father of Cn. Pompeius Magnus , probably in his consulship (B.C. 89), gave the <title>ius Latii</title> or <title>Latinitas</title> to all the towns of the Transpadani, and probably the <seg lang="la">civitas</seg> to the Cispadani.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pompēia de Ambĭtu</hi>. See <ref type="cross" target="crossambitus">Ambitus</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pompēia de Iure Magistratuum</hi> forbade a person to be a candidate for public offices (<seg lang="la">petitio honorum</seg>) who was not at Rome; but Iulius Caesar was excepted.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pompēia de Vi</hi> was a <seg lang="la">privilegium</seg>, and only referred to the case of <ref type="cross" target="crossmilo">Milo</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>POPILIA. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Papia</hi>, above.</p>
 <p>PORCIA DE CAPITE CIVIUM or DE PROVOCATIŌNE (B.C. 197) enacted that a Roman citizen should not be scourged or put to death.</p>
 <p>PORCIA DE PROVINCIIS (about B.C. 198). The passage in Livy (<title>Sumptus quos in cultum praetorum</title>, etc.) is supposed to refer to a Porcian law, to which the <seg lang="la">plebiscitum de thermensibus</seg> refers; and the words quoted by Cicero (<title>Ne quis emat mancipium</title>) are taken, as it is conjectured, from this Porcian law.</p>
 <p>PUBLICIA permitted betting at certain games which required strength, as running and leaping.</p>

 <p>RHODIA. The Rhodians had a maritime code which was highly esteemed. Some of its provisions were adopted by the Romans, and have thus been incorporated into the maritime law of European states. <cb /> Strabo speaks of the wise laws of Rhodes and their admirable policy, especially in naval matters; and Cicero to the same effect. The <title>Digest</title> contains so much of the <title>lex Rhodiorum</title> as relates to <seg lang="la">iactus</seg>, or the throwing overboard of goods in order to save the vessel or remainder of the cargo. This <title>lex Rhodiorum de Iactu</title> is not a law in the proper sense of the term. See Schryver, <bibl default="NO"><title>Sur la Loi Rhodia de Iactu</title> (Brussels, 1884)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>ROSCIA THEATRĀLIS, proposed by the tribune L. Roscius Otho (B.C. 67), which gave the <seg lang="la">equites</seg> a special place at the public spectacles in fourteen rows or seats (<seg lang="la">in quattuordecim gradibus sive ordinibus</seg>) next to the place of the senators, which was in the orchestra. This law also assigned a certain place to spendthrifts (<seg lang="la">decoctores</seg>). The phrase, <seg lang="la">sedere in quattuordecim ordinibus</seg>, is equivalent to having the proper <seg lang="la">census equestris</seg> which was required by the law. There are numerous allusions to this law, which is sometimes simply called the law of Otho, or referred to by his name.</p>
 <p>RUBRIA. The province of Gallia Cisalpina ceased to be a province, and became a part of Italia about the year B.C. 49 or 42. When this change took place, it was necessary to provide for the administration of justice, as the usual modes of provincial administration would cease with the determination of the provincial form of government. This was effected by a law, the name of which is unknown, but a large part of it, on a bronze tablet, is preserved in the Museum at Parma. This law arranged the judiciary establishment of the former province, and appointed <seg lang="la">duo viri</seg> and <seg lang="la">quattuor viri iure dicundo;</seg> a <title>praefectus Mutinensis</title> is also mentioned in the law. In two passages of this law a <title>lex Rubria</title> is mentioned, which, according to some, is an earlier law, by which Mutina was made a <seg lang="la">praefectura;</seg> and, according to others, the <title>lex Rubria</title> is this very <title>lex de Cisalpina.</title> This subject is discussed by Savigny and by Puchta.</p>
 <p>This law has been published several times; the text is lithographed in Ritschl's volume of inscriptions, i. taf. 32.</p>
 <p>RUPILIAE LEGES (B.C. 131) were the regulations established by P. Rupilius and ten <seg lang="la">legati</seg> for the administration of the province of Sicily after the close of the first Servile War. They were made in pursuance of a <seg lang="la">consultum</seg> of the Senate. Cicero speaks of these regulations as a <seg lang="la">decretum</seg> of Rupilius, which, he says, they call <title>lex Rupilia;</title> but it was not a law proper. The powers given to the commissioners by the <title>lex Iulia municipalis</title> were of a similar kind.</p>
 <p>SACRĀTAE, mentioned by Livy (ii. 33) and by Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> ii. 7, 18). Leges were properly so called which had for their object to make a thing or person <seg lang="la">sacer.</seg> The <seg lang="la">consecratio</seg> was, in fact, the sanction by which a law was to be enforced. In the latter case, it was the opinion of the <hi rend="italic">jurisconsults</hi> that the law did not make <seg lang="la">sacrosancti</seg> the persons for whose protection it was designed, but that it made <seg lang="la">sacer </seg> (<seg lang="la">sacrum sanxit</seg>) any one who injured them; and this interpretation is consistent with the terms of the law. An example of a <seg lang="la">lex sacrata</seg> is that making the tribunes of the people sacred (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>A <seg lang="la">lex sacrata militaria</seg> is also mentioned by Livy.</p>
 <p>SATŬ See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex</ref>.</p>
 <p>SCANTINIA, proposed by a tribune. The date and contents are not known, but its object was to 
<pb n="946" /><cb />
 suppress unnatural crimes. It existed in the time of Cicero. The <title>lex Iulia de adulteriis</title> considered this offence as included in <seg lang="la">stuprum</seg>, and it was punishable with a fine; but by the later imperial constitution the punishment was death ( <title>Domit.</title> 8).</p>
 <p>SCRIBONIA. The date and whole import of this law are not known; but it enacted that a right to <seg lang="la">servitutes</seg> should not be acquired by usucapion, from which it appears that the law was once different. See <ref type="cross" target="crossservitus">Servitus</ref>.</p>
 <p>SEMPRONIA DE FENŎRE (B.C. 193) was a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> proposed by the tribune M. Sempronius, which enacted that the law (<seg lang="la">ius</seg>) about money lent (<seg lang="la">pecunia credita</seg>) should be the same for the Socii and Latini (<title>Socii ac nomen Latinum</title>) as for Roman citizens. The object of the law was to prevent Romans from lending money in the name of the <title>Socii</title>, who were not bound by the <seg lang="la">fenebres leges.</seg> The law could obviously only apply within the jurisdiction of Rome.</p>
 <p>SEMPRONIAE. Various <seg lang="la">leges</seg> proposed by the Gracchi were so named. See <ref type="cross" target="crossagrariae-leges">Agrariae Leges</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Sempronia de Capĭte Civium</hi>, carried by C. Gracchus (B.C. 123), reaffirming the old principle that no judgment involving the life or freedom of a citizen should be valid without the assent of the Roman people ( <bibl n="Gel.  10. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.x. 3</bibl>).</p>
 <p>SERVILIA AGRARIA, proposed by the tribune P. Servilius Rullus in the consulship of Cicero (B.C. 63), was a very extensive agrarian law. It was successfully opposed by Cicero; but it was in substance carried by Caesar (B.C. 59), and is the law called by Cicero <title>lex Campana</title>, from the public land called Ager Campanus being assigned under this law.</p>
 <p>SERVILIA GLAUCIA DE REPETUNDIS. See <ref type="cross" target="crossrepetundarum-crimen">Repetundae</ref>.</p>
 <p>SILIA. The <seg lang="la">legis actio</seg> called <seg lang="la">condictio</seg> was established by this law in the case when the demand was a determinate sum of money (<seg lang="la">certa pecunia</seg>). See <ref type="cross" target="crossactio">Actio</ref>.</p>
 <p>SULPICIAE, proposed by the tribune P. Sulpicius Galba, a supporter of Marius (B.C. 88), enacted the recall of the exiles, the distribution of the new citizens and the <seg lang="la">libertini</seg> among the thirty-five tribes, that the command in the Mithridatic War should be taken from Sulla and given to Marius, and that a senator should not contract debt to the amount of more than 2000 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($100). The last enactment may have been intended to expel persons from the Senate who should get into debt. All these laws were repealed by Sulla.</p>
 <p> SEMPRONIA (B.C. 304). No name is given to this law by Livy , but it was probably proposed by the consuls. It prevented the dedication of a temple or altar without the consent of the Senate or a majority of the tribunes.</p>

This rogatio probably led to the subsequent legislation of the Decemviri. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstwelve-tables">Twelve Tables</ref>.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λεξικόν</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">βιβλίον</foreign>). A Greek name for a word-book, probably first used in the ninth century A.D. The Latin equivalent <hi rend="italic">dictionarium</hi> appears about three centuries later. Chinese writers pretend that lexicons have been known in their language for 3000 years. But the conception of a condensed digest of a branch of knowledge, classified and ordered for convenient reference, is traced by authentic records to that source of all ideas which have been fruitful of intellectual growth, the great age of Greece. In Plato's time, the Homeric poems were a text-book for the study of the youth of Athens, and collections of peculiar words and phrases, with explanations, were made for the use of teachers. At first the notes were written in the order of the text, but convenience soon dictated other arrangements, by subjects or by alphabetical sequence. Before B.C. 400 Democritus of Abdera discussed the vocabulary of Homer, and is even said to have compiled an Homeric dictionary. Clearchus of Soli, a pupil of Aristotle, prepared a treatise on the mathematical terms in Plato's <title>Republic.</title> Near the end of the fourth century B.C., Philetas of Cos, celebrated as a poet by Theocritus 
<pb n="947" /><cb />
 and Propertius, wrote a famous book, <foreign lang="greek">ἄτακτα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσαι</foreign>, on the meanings of words, especially of poetical and dialectic forms. His successors of the Alexandrian school of grammarians industriously compiled special dictionaries or glossaries, now to particular authors, as Homer, Plato, and the dramatists, now of the language of tragedy or comedy, again of dialectic conceptions, which encroached on the province of good Attic words, and even of the technical terms of particular arts. Thus Zenodotus of Ephesus, about B.C. 280, prepared an elaborate glossary (<foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσαι</foreign>) to Homer; Artemidorus of Byzantium soon after made a dictionary of cookery (<foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσαι ὀψαρτυτικαί</foreign>); and scores of others collected extensive word-lists of Plato's writings, of tragedy, of comedy, of history, of medicine. Didymus of Alexandria, an indefatigable compiler of the first century B.C., published at least twentyeight “books” (rolls?) on tragic diction (<foreign lang="greek">περὶ τραγῳδουμένης λέξεως</foreign>), a work of similar extent on the language of comedy, seven “books” on words of ambiguous or doubtful meaning, and a treatise on corrupt expressions. Pollux and Athenaeus name twenty-one writers on terms peculiar to cookery. In short, through the many generations of grammatical activity which succeeded the creative period of Greek literature, the interpretation of words assumed ever greater prominence, until Zopyrion and Pamphilus, near the end of the reign of Augustus, attempted to bring together the rich materials thus furnished, in a comprehensive lexicon of the language (95 books, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ γλωσσῶν</foreign>). An abridgment of this great work by Diogenianus of Heraclea (A.D. 130?) is said, on doubtful authority, to have been the basis of the dictionary ascribed to Hesychius of Alexandria (A.D. 380?), which is a principal source of information upon the Greek language and literature <bibl default="NO">(best ed. by Moritz Schmidt, 4 vols. 4to, Jena, 1858-64)</bibl>. The important lexicon called that of Suidas, and ascribed to the eleventh century, is a miscellany of lexicographical and literary excerpts and comments made by many hands in successive ages <bibl default="NO">(best editions by Gaisford, 3 vols. fol., Oxford, 1834; by Bernhardy, 4to, Halle, 1834)</bibl>. The first attempt systematically to explain Greek words in Latin was perhaps the glossary of Philoxenus, A.D. 550 (first printed, fol., Paris, 1573, included in Valpy's ed. of Stephens' <title>Thesaurus</title>, London, 1816), but for 800 years afterwards the Greek language was almost forgotten in Catholic Europe.</p>
 <p>Upon the revival of learning an earnest demand for such helps was felt, and old vocabularies and glossaries were eagerly copied and enlarged. In 1483 the first Greek-Latin vocabulary was printed, that of John Crastenus. It passed through several editions, growing in size. In 1497 appeared a much more important work from the press of Aldus, Venice (<title>Dictionarium Graecum Copiosissimum cum Interp. Lat.</title>), and was rapidly followed by similar lexicons in the names of Julius Pollux, Budaeus, Münster, Gillius, Gessner, Grynaeus, Dasypodius, Constantine, and others. Each of these copied most of his work from his latest predecessor, but often with important, though irregular additions. Thus the dictionary of Budaeus <bibl default="NO">(first published at Paris, 1529; reprinted at Basle, 1530; reëdited and much enlarged by Robert Stephens, Paris, 1548)</bibl> was copious and exact in explaining legal and forensic terms. Montanus, in 1539, gave to scholars the first Latin-Greek <cb /> vocabulary, for use in writing Greek. Robert Constantine's lexicon (Geneva, 1562: a marked improvement on earlier ones in accuracy) was especially valuable in illustrations of Thucydides. But in 1572 Henry Stephens published his <title>Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</title> (5 vols. fol., Paris), containing more than 100,000 Greek words, with references to authorities; a work of surpassing industry and scholarship, which remained unrivalled for nearly 250 years. It was reproduced in magnificent form, and with additions, by Valpy (London, 1816 foll.), and again by Hase and Dindorf (Paris, 1836 foll.). The Greek manuals of Scapula <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1579)</bibl>, Hederich <bibl default="NO">(2 vols. 8vo, Leipzig, 1766)</bibl>, and others, in common use until the early years of this century, were hardly more than extracts of the great <title>Thesaurus.</title> Several special lexicons, however, such as those of Portus to Herodotus <bibl default="NO">(Frankfort, 1603; reprinted London, 1825)</bibl> and to Pindar <bibl default="NO">(1606)</bibl>, of Seber to Homer <bibl default="NO">(1604)</bibl>, of Damm to Homer and Pindar <bibl default="NO">(1765- 1774)</bibl>, of Ernesti for the technical terms of rhetoric <bibl default="NO">(1795)</bibl>, of Reiske to Theocritus <bibl default="NO">(1765)</bibl>, of Sturz to Xenophon <bibl default="NO">(1801-4)</bibl>, of Schweighäuser to Herodotus <bibl default="NO">(1824)</bibl>, and of Wyttenbach to Plutarch <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1843)</bibl>, collected the results of more accurate criticism in parts of the field. The first general lexicon which exhibited a marked improvement upon Stephens in method, and the first which defined Greek words in a modern language, was the critical Greek-German lexicon of Schneider <bibl default="NO">(2 vols. 8vo, 1797-98)</bibl>. It passed through three editions, besides abridgments, and was then reconstructed with admirable skill by Passow <bibl default="NO">(1819-23)</bibl>. The latest revision of Passow's <title>Handwörterbuch</title>, by Rost and five well-equipped associates <bibl default="NO">(3 vols. 4to, 1841- 1857)</bibl>, is still the standard of Greek exegesis in Germany, though the rival works of Pape <bibl default="NO">(1842- 1845; 3d ed. by Sengebusch, 1880)</bibl>, of Jacobitz and Seiler <bibl default="NO">(1839-46)</bibl>, and of Suhle and Schneidewin <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1875)</bibl>, have peculiar merits and strong eulogists. Students whose mother-tongue was English had no trustworthy general dictionary of Greek until 1848, when Liddell and Scott published at Oxford their Greek-English lexicon, drawn mainly from Passow; which was improved and enlarged, first by Drisler <bibl default="NO">(N. Y. 1850)</bibl>, and later by the original editors, aided by several American scholars, so that it now renders the student for most purposes independent of the <title>Thesaurus</title> and of special lexicons to the Greek classics <bibl default="NO">(7th ed. London and New York, 1883)</bibl>. Of such special lexicons, the most complete and accurate are Ast's dictionary to Plato <bibl default="NO">(3 vols. Leipzig, 1835-38)</bibl>, Bétant's to Thucydides <bibl default="NO">(2 vols. 1843-49)</bibl>, the index of Bonitz to Aristotle <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1870)</bibl>, the Lexicon Sophocleum of Ellendt <bibl default="NO">(best ed. Berlin, 1872)</bibl>, Bindseil's Concordantia to Pindar <bibl default="NO">(1875)</bibl>, the Lexicon Aeschyleum of Dindorf <bibl default="NO">(1876)</bibl>, the Lexicon Theocriteum <bibl default="NO">(1879)</bibl>, the Lexicon Pindaricum <bibl default="NO">(1883)</bibl> of Rumpel, and, above all, the Lexicon Homericum of Capelle and several associates <bibl default="NO">(1874-83)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The lexicography of the Greek Testament and of ecclesiastical writers has long formed a distinct and very extensive branch of the science, important epochs in which have been marked by Pasor's <title>Lexicon Graec.-Lat.</title> in <bibl default="NO"><title>Novum Testamentum</title> (1636; best ed. by Fischer, Leipzig, 1767)</bibl>; Suicer's <title>Thesaurus Ecclesiasticus</title> (Amsterdam, 1682; often reprinted and abridged); Wahl's <bibl default="NO"><title>Clavis Novi Testamenti</title> (1819; translated by Robinson, New York, 1825; best ed. Leipzig, 1853)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO">Schirlitz, <title>Griech.-deutsches Wörterbuch zum N. T.</title> (1851-58)</bibl>; 
<pb n="948" /><cb /> Robinson's <bibl default="NO"><title>Lexicon of the New Testament</title> (New York, 1836; rewritten, New York, 1850)</bibl>; Cremer's <bibl default="NO"><title>Biblisches-theologisches Wörterb.</title> (3d and best ed. Gotha, 1881-82)</bibl>; Grimm's <bibl default="NO"><title>Lexicon zum Neuen Testament</title> (Leipzig, 1862-68; best ed. 1879)</bibl>; translated and much improved by Thayer <bibl default="NO">(New York, 1887)</bibl>. The Glossary of later and Byzantine Greek, by Sophocles <bibl default="NO">(Cambridge, 1860)</bibl>, enlarged into a Greek lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine periods <bibl default="NO">(Boston, 1870)</bibl>, is the standard in its department. By far the most complete and useful English-Greek lexicon is that by Yonge <bibl default="NO">(London, 1849; best ed. New York, 1870)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The beginnings of Latin lexicography are ascribed to Verrius Flaccus, whom Augustus made the tutor of his grandsons. His great work, <title>De Significatu Verborum</title>, is supposed to have been abridged, some generations later, by Pompeius Festus, under the same title; and extensive fragments of the abridgment, besides unintelligent excerpts from it by Paulus Diaconus of the eighth century, are still preserved <bibl default="NO">(best ed. by C. O. Müller, Leipzig, 1839; reprinted 1880)</bibl>. There are also curious remnants of verbal exegesis in the fragments of Nonius Marcellus <bibl default="NO">(about A.D. 300; best eds. by Mercier, Leipzig, 1825; by Quicherat, Paris, 1871)</bibl> and of Isidore <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 600; best ed. by Arevalo, 7 vols. Rome, 1797-1803)</bibl>. Glossaries and vocabularies were common in the ages before printing; but were compiled as needed, copied, abridged, corrected, and enlarged, according to the knowledge or ignorance of each new compiler, or the special need to be met. None of them were regarded as literary works, to be studied and preserved, in deference to the author's authority, or in respect to his fame. Many of these remain in old libraries. One of the best, a glossary of the ninth century, in the national library at Paris, has been admirably edited, with a commentary containing the substance of twelve others, by Professor G. F. Hildebrand <bibl default="NO">(Göttingen, 1854)</bibl>. A learned description of the works of this class, which were still unedited, was given by G. Löwe, in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Prodromus Glossariorum Latinorum</title> (Leipzig, 1876)</bibl>, and much light was thrown by him upon their origin and value. His project for a collection of the extant glossaries has been carried on with energy since his death, under the auspices of the Royal Literary Society of Saxony, by George Goetz, who has published four volumes (<title>Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum</title>, II., III., IV., V., 1886-94) of the nine which are necessary to complete it. These vocabularies explained rare and obscure words, ambiguous terms, forms of doubtful authority, or of dialectic or foreign origin; and it was but slowly that the conception was formed of a complete vocabulary of the language. About A.D. 1063, Papias, the Lombard, finished his <bibl default="NO"><title>Elementarium Doctrinae Erudimentum</title> (printed, Venice, 1491)</bibl>, intended for an encyclopaedia of instruction, a large part of which was devoted to defining words. A century later the monk Osborn of Gloucester followed with the <title>Panorama</title>, an attempt at an etymological dictionary (published in Mai's <title>Classicorum Auctorum</title>, tom. viii. Rome, 1836). About A.D. 1200, Hugutio, Bishop of Ferrara, wrote a <title>Liber Derivationum.</title> On the works of Papias and Hugutio was founded the famous <title>Catholicon</title>, by Balbi of Genoa (Joannes Januensis), finished A.D. 1286, and published at Mayence in 1460, containing, besides a manual of grammar, rhetoric, and criticism, a copious lexicon, <cb /> especially of ecclesiastical Latin. Johann Reuchlin enlarged this in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Vocabularius Breviloquus</title> (Basle, 1475)</bibl>, which passed through twentythree editions, the last in 1504. The <title>Cornucopiae</title> of Nicholas Perotti, though in form a commentary on Martial, is lexicographical in substance, and has an alphabetic index (1482 and often). In 1502 appeared at Reggio, in Italy, the <title>Dictionarium</title> of Ambrosius Calepinus, the first attempt to represent the classical language as a whole, with illustrative citations from the literature. Its fame grew rapidly. For many years labourers in this department of learning accepted it as a standard, and sought only to supply its omissions. Twenty editions were published within a generation, and “Calepinus” became the common name for a lexicon. In 1539 Jacobus Montanus added to the definitions the Greek equivalents. In 1546 a Calepinus Pentaglottus was issued at Venice; in 1581 a Calepinus Septem Linguarum at Leyden; and successive editors added new languages, until the Calepinus of 1603 was a parallel lexicon of eleven. Meanwhile, in 1531, Robert Stephens, <seg lang="la">princeps lexicographorum</seg>, gave to the world his <title>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae;</title> but used it as the basis of a far more comprehensive and accurate work under the same title, which he completed in 1548. This long remained the unrivalled storehouse of the language, and every important dictionary of classical Latin was substantially a reprint <bibl default="NO">(3 vols. Venice, 1551; 4 vols. Leyden, 1573)</bibl>, or an abridgment of it. From the first edition was compiled the <title>Promptuarium</title> of Trebellius <bibl default="NO">(Basle, 1545)</bibl>; from the second, the extensive <title>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</title> of Caelius Secundus <bibl default="NO">(Basle, 1561)</bibl>, the useful <title>Thesaurus</title> of Faber Soranus <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1571; 2d ed. 1587; abridged, Leipzig, 1594, and Heidelberg, 1608)</bibl>, the <title>Lexicon Criticum</title> of Pareus <bibl default="NO">(Nuremberg, 1645)</bibl>, and many more. The most important original work of this period in lexicography was the <title>Glossarium ad Scriptores Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis</title> of DuCange <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1678)</bibl>, which has been several times reprinted <bibl default="NO">(ed. by Hendschel, 7 vols. Paris, 1840- 1850; ed. by Favre, 10 vols. Niort, 1883-88; a good abridgment by Migne, Paris, 1866; and very important supplements by Diefenbach, Frankfurt, 1857 and 1867)</bibl>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdu-cange">DuCange</ref>.) An association of Cambridge scholars reëdited the great <title>Thesaurus</title>, at the end of its second century of preëminence, with large additions <bibl default="NO">(4 vols. London, 1734-35)</bibl>. Antony Birrius recovered the collections Henry Stephens had made for a new edition of his father's work, and surpassed the English reprint in the accuracy of his reproduction <bibl default="NO">(4 vols. Basle, 1740-43)</bibl>. Finally, J. M. Gessner, after preparing an enlarged edition of Faber <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1726)</bibl>, spent twelve years in revising the <title>Thesaurus</title> of Stephens, correcting and completing its classical citations, while excluding much ecclesiastical and semi-barbarous material <bibl default="NO">(4 vols. Leipzig, 1749)</bibl>. But in Italy, Calepinus retained the primacy, undergoing many revisions and enlargements before that of Sartori <bibl default="NO">(Padua, 1708)</bibl>, which brought its imperfections to the notice of two of the most eminent Latinists of the day, then at the University of Padua. With the supervision and aid of Facciolati, his pupil Forcellini devoted three years to its correction and extension (<title>Septem linguarum Calepinus, hoc est Lexicon Latinum, variarum linguarum interpretatione adiecta</title>, Pavia, 1718), and his important edition was eleven times reprinted. The last appearances of this lexicon, 
<pb n="949" /><cb /> which held its place in the schools for nine generations, were at Venice, 1778, and at Pavia, 1779. But Forcellini's labours on Calepinus taught him the need of a more perfect dictionary, and he undertook to construct it mainly from the original texts. For forty years, with some interruptions from church-work, he toiled, with rare intelligence and persistence; and at his death, in 1768, left complete in manuscript the greatest contribution to this department of science ever achieved by a single hand (<title>Totius Latinitatis Lexicon</title>, 2 vols. fol. Padua, 1771). It has been several times reprinted (4 vols. Padua, 1805, etc.), sometimes with uncritical additions <bibl default="NO">(ed. Bailey, London, 1827; ed. Schumann, Schneeberg, 1835)</bibl>, sometimes with diligence and literary skill <bibl default="NO">(ed. Furnaletti, 4 vols. 4to, Padua, 1827-33; ed. De Vit, 5 vols. fol. Prato, 1858-75)</bibl>; but none of these editions has conformed the citations to the improved critical texts of the classical authors. The latest (ed. Corradini, Padua, 1864, completed to the word <hi rend="SmallCaps">stellio</hi>, 1894) is by far the best in this respect, though still defective in etymology and arrangement. Scheller's Latin-German Lexicon <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1783)</bibl> was at first an abridgment of Forcellini's, but was rapidly improved by the compiler in successive editions <bibl default="NO">(3d ed. 5 vols. Leipzig, 1804)</bibl>. His condensed hand-lexicon <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1792)</bibl> was reëdited many times by Lünemann, aided in the seventh edition <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1831)</bibl> by Georges, who issued the eighth edition <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1837)</bibl> alone, and then reconstructed the work, under his own name, in the <title>Ausführliches Handwörterbuch der lateinischen Sprache</title>, whose seventh edition <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1879-80)</bibl> is the reliance and the delight of all who study Latin through German, though it omits, in most cases, specific local references to texts. Klotz's <bibl default="NO"><title>Handwörterbuch der lateinischen Sprache</title> (2 vols. Brunswick, 1853-57)</bibl> is distinguished for fulness of illustration in many articles, especially under the earliest letters of the alphabet; but it was hastily finished, and is defective in uniformity and in typographical accuracy. Freund's <bibl default="NO"><title>Handwörterbuch</title> (4 vols. Leipzig, 1834)</bibl>, also founded on Forcellini, introduced a principle, the historical arrangement of meanings in each article, which has since been fruitful in all departments of lexicography. A revised translation by Andrews <bibl default="NO">(New York, 1850)</bibl>, substantially reprinted as Dr. Smith's Latin Dictionary <bibl default="NO">(London, 1853)</bibl>, was for many years the standard in the United States and Great Britain. An enlarged translation into French by Theil <bibl default="NO">(2 vols. Paris, 1866)</bibl> is valuable for its full notices of terms of natural history. The same work was revised and enlarged by Riddle and White <bibl default="NO">(London, 1870)</bibl>, and entirely reconstructed by Lewis and Short <bibl default="NO">(Harper's Latin Dictionary, New York, 1879)</bibl>. The best English-Latin dictionary is that of Smith and Hall <bibl default="NO">(London, 1870; New York, 1871)</bibl>; the most complete and critical work in which a modern language is explained in Latin is the <title>Deutsches-latein. Wörterbuch</title> of Georges <bibl default="NO">(6th ed. 2 vols. Leipzig, 1870)</bibl>. In recent years German scholars have shown new zeal in constructing complete word-books (concordances) to Latin classics. Merguet's <bibl default="NO"><title>Lexicon zu den Reden des Cicero</title> (4 vols. 4to, Jena, 1877-84)</bibl> has been followed by the full dictionaries to Caesar of Merguet <bibl default="NO">(Jena, 1884- 1886)</bibl>, Menge and Preuss <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1884-90)</bibl>, and Meusel <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1884-93)</bibl>; by that of Preuss to the pseudo-Caesarian books of Hirtius and others <bibl default="NO">(Erlangen, 1884)</bibl>; while complete verbal indexes to <cb /> the fragments of Plautus, the works of Sallust, and those of several minor poets have been added to recent editions of the texts. A complete lexicon to the philosophical writings of Cicero by Merguet (Jena, vols. i. ii. 1887-93, vol. iii. in the press), one by Gerber and Greef to Tacitus <bibl default="NO">(fasciculi i. to xi. Leipzig, 1887-93)</bibl>, and one on an enormous scale to Livy by Fügner <bibl default="NO">(fasciculi i. to vi. Leipzig, 1889-94)</bibl> are slowly appearing. The principles and methods of constructing a complete thesaurus of the language have been actively discussed in Germany for two generations. In 1857 the king of Bavaria offered to contribute 10,000 gulden if the completion of such a work could be insured; Carl Halm of Munich, with Ritschl and Fleckeisen, undertook to organize an association of scholars, and Bücheler was selected as editor-in-chief; but political and military troubles smothered the scheme. The critical restoration of many texts, the reform of orthography, the multiplication of special lexicons, and the great advances made in philology and in the study of inscriptions have since vastly increased and improved the materials available for a <title>Thesaurus.</title> In 1884 E. Wölfflin announced his <title>Archiv für lateinische Lexicographie und Grammatik . . . als Vorarbeit zu einem Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</title>, and under the patronage of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences began its publication in quarterly numbers, containing collections, notices, reviews, and model articles, as contributions to the most complete digest of a great language ever planned. With the aid of many competent scholars, this periodical has been continued through eight years, and has done much to awaken interest in the subject. The last number for 1893 contained a plan, <title>zur Begründung eines Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</title>, in twelve volumes of 1000 large quarto pages each, under the auspices of the five great academies of science in Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig, Munich, and Vienna, to be finished in twenty years, at an estimated cost of 605,000 marks (about $150,000). The five academies have sanctioned the plan, with Messrs. Bücheler, Wölfflin, and Leo as editorial directors, and there is reasonable hope of its success.</p>

<head orig="Libanius">Libanius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λιβάνιος</foreign>). A Greek rhetorician of Antioch in Syria, born A.D. 314. His education was begun in his native city and completed at Athens, where he became a public teacher at the early age of twenty-five. Called from Athens to Constantinople in 340, he met with extraordinary success; at the same time he excited the envy of his rivals, whose slanders led to his expulsion in 345. After being actively engaged for five years as a public teacher in Nicomedia in Bithynia, he was recalled to Constantinople, where he was again remarkably popular, but found himself compelled by the continued persecutions of his detractors to leave the capital once more in 353. He withdrew to his native city of Antioch, where he was for many years actively employed in the exercise of his profession and in promoting the interests of his fellow-citizens; but even here he was much persecuted by his opponents. Apart from bodily sufferings caused by his being struck by a flash of lightning, his old age was saddened by the decline of learning and the fall of paganism, which he had foreseen would follow the lamented death of his admirer and patron, Julian. He died about A.D. 393, honoured and admired by his pupils, among whom were included Christians such as Basil the Great and Iohannes Chrysostomus.</p>
 <p>Libanius gives us information about his own life and work in a series of letters and in a speech “on his own fortune,” written in his sixtieth year, but completed at a later date. There remains sixtyseven of his speeches, the majority of which refer to the events of his time; also fifty declamations; a considerable series of rhetorical exercises of various kinds, among them narratives, sketches of character and descriptions of works of art (some of them important in connection with the history of ancient art), and also arguments to the speeches of Demosthenes. There are, further, about 2000 letters addressed to friends, pupils, rhetoricians, scholars, statesmen, etc., which give us a vivid picture of his times. A fourth part of them, however, only exist in a Latin translation, and some of them are of doubtful genuineness.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βίβλος, βιβλίον</foreign>). A book; but among the Greeks and Romans, until a very late period, to be understood as referring to a roll. The modern book shape was used for the <hi rend="italic">codex</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τεῦχος</foreign>) only, as explained in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscodex">Codex</ref>. The Latin name <seg lang="la">liber</seg> meant originally the bark, rind, or bust of a tree, which was early used for writing material, as afterwards for the manufacture of paper (<seg lang="la">charta</seg>). (For an account of the writing materials used in ancient times, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspalaeography">Palaeography</ref>.) The same meaning is found in the Greek term <foreign lang="greek">βίβλος</foreign>, properly “rind” or “bark” (<foreign lang="greek">βύβλος</foreign>). For the preparation of papyrus of which the pages of books were made, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspapyrus">Papyrus</ref>. The pages (<foreign lang="greek">σελίδες</foreign>, <seg lang="la">paginae</seg>) having been prepared, they were pasted together (<seg lang="la">conglutinatae</seg>) to form a long roll; but sometimes the pages were written first and pasted into a roll afterwards, for which purpose some people kept <seg lang="la">glutinatores</seg> ( <title>Ad Att.</title> iv. 4). The writing was in columns, so that the lines of writing were parallel to the sides of the roll: on each page there was a column, and there was a blank space between each column. Down to the time of Caesar, however, it was the custom to write official documents <seg lang="la">transversa charta;</seg> that is to say, across the whole breadth of the roll, so that the lines of writing were at right angles to the sides of the roll. This explains the passage in 
<pb n="951" /><cb /> <title>Iul.</title> 56. The shape and appearance of Greek and Roman books will be understood from the following illustration. <figure id="fig.00951">

</figure></p>
 <p>The roll was sometimes of considerable length. The Scholiasts, indeed, speak of Thucydides and Homer as being written each in one long roll. The roll of Thucydides is estimated at about 578 pages, nearly 100 yards—surely an incredible length; and a Homer roll, 120 yards in length, is said to have been in existence at Constantinople. But this was not the usual system, and the roll rarely exceeded 100 pages (cf. <bibl n="Mart.  8. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 44</bibl>), and was usually much smaller. It was customary to divide a long work (<seg lang="la">opus</seg> or <seg lang="la">corpus</seg>) into several books (<seg lang="la">libri</seg>), each <seg lang="la">liber</seg> being in one roll (<seg lang="la">volumen;</seg> in Greek, <foreign lang="greek">τομός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κύλινδρος</foreign>). Greek writers sometimes called these <seg lang="la">libri</seg> or divisions of a work <foreign lang="greek">βίβλια</foreign>, sometimes <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι</foreign>, and in the later Empire <foreign lang="greek">συγγράμματα</foreign>. Thus, in contrast to the huge roll of Homer, said to have been at Constantinople, we have the papyrus of the twenty-fourth book of the <title>Iliad</title> from Elephantiné, so that the complete <title>Iliad</title> would have been in twenty-four rolls or volumes. The pages were numbered, or at any rate the total number was usually put on the <seg lang="la">titulus:</seg> even the total number of verses, or of lines in a prose work, were sometimes written on it. The price of the book was in part estimated by this number (<title>C. I. L.</title> iii. p. 831).</p>
 <p>The writing was usually only on one side of the paper. The other side in old books was utilized for school-boys' exercises ( <bibl n="Mart.  4. 86" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 86</bibl>); or as scribbling paper ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 62</bibl>). Both sides were, however, sometimes used for the original work, and the books were then called <seg lang="la">opisthographi</seg> (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> iii. 5). Sometimes the writing was sponged out (as in a parchment palimpsest) and the paper used over again.</p>
 <p>The roll was protected against worms by being smeared with cedar oil, which gave the paper a yellow tinge (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 1, 13; <bibl n="Mart.  3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 2</bibl>; <title>A. P.</title> 331); then the last leaf was pasted on to a thin piece of wood called the <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg> or <foreign lang="greek">ὄμφαλος</foreign> (the <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg> is found also made of tightly-folded paper). Hence the last page is called <hi rend="italic">eschatocollion</hi> ( <bibl n="Mart.  2. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.ii. 6</bibl>); and the expression <seg lang="la">ad umbilicum adducere</seg> means to finish (<seg lang="la">ad cornua</seg>, <bibl n="Mart.  20. 107" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xx. 107</bibl>). The edges (<seg lang="la">frons</seg>) of the roll were carefully cut, and also smoothed with pumice-stone (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 1, 13; <bibl n="Mart.  1. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 67</bibl>; viii. 72). As a further decoration, the ends (<seg lang="la">cornua</seg>) of the <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg> were sometimes gilded as far as they projected ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 61</bibl>). The edges themselves (<seg lang="la">frons</seg>) were also coloured. A strip of parchment on which the title or subject of the book, and sometimes its number of pages or even lines, was written, was pasted on to the roll. This strip was called <seg lang="la">titulus</seg> or <hi rend="italic">index</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σίττυβοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σίττυβαι</foreign>). This <seg lang="la">titulus</seg> or index was often painted a bright colour. Finally, a cover for the roll (<seg lang="la">membrana</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">διφθέρα</foreign>) was made of parchment coloured red or yellow. If one work was in several <seg lang="la">libri</seg>, they were tied in a bundle (<seg lang="la">fasces, fasciculus</seg>, <bibl n="Gel.  9. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.ix. 4</bibl>, or <foreign lang="greek">δέσμη</foreign>). The only other addition to be noticed is that occasionally the portrait of the author was placed on the first page of the book ( <title>De Tranq. An.</title> 9; <bibl n="Mart.  14. 186" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 186</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In reading, the roll (<seg lang="la">liber</seg> or <seg lang="la">volumen</seg>) was held in both hands and unrolled with one, while the <cb /> other rolled it up. The unrolling was called <seg lang="la">evolvere, revolvere</seg>, or <seg lang="la">volvere;</seg> going right through was called <seg lang="la">explicare;</seg> rolling up again, <seg lang="la">convolvere, replicare</seg>, or <seg lang="la">complicare.</seg> In rolling it up tightly, it was convenient to do so by holding the <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg> with both hands while the first page was pressed under the chin. This is the meaning of <seg lang="la">quae trita duro non inhorruit mento</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  1. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 66</bibl>; cf. x. 93). The apparatus of a book is given completely by Martial (iii. 2): <lb />“Cedro nunc licet ambules perunctus <lb />Et frontis gemino decens honore <lb />Pictis luxurieris umbilicis; <lb />Et te purpura delicata velet <lb />Et cocco rubeat superbus index.”</p>
 <p>The multiplication of books at Rome began after the conquest and pacification of Italy; but booksellers' shops were not known until the end of the Republic. The earliest mention of such shops is in Cicero (<title>Ad Q. Fr.</title> iii. 4) and Philo (ii. 9<bibl n="Philo  21" default="NO">Philo, 21</bibl>); but they were then still uncommon, and we find Atticus selling books, for the copying of which he had a large number of slaves ( <title>Ad Att.</title> ii. 4). Booksellers were called <seg lang="la">librarii</seg> and also <seg lang="la">bibliopolae</seg>, and in Greek <foreign lang="greek">βιβλιοκάπηλοι</foreign>. Horace gives us the name of the Sosii Brothers (<title>Epist.</title> i. 20, 2). Martial names several, and specifies Argiletum as the booksellers' quarter (i. 3, 117); there were also the Vicus Sandaliarius and the Sigillaria. There were booksellers, too, in the provincial towns—e. g. at Lugdunum (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> ix. 11) and at Brundisium ( <bibl n="Gel.  9. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.ix. 4</bibl>). As to the price, we have no very clear information; but it would seem that a book was not necessarily, as regards the cost of production, very expensive, though it might, from special circumstances, command a large price. Gellius (ii. 3) speaks of the second book of the <title>Aeneid</title> being bought for <seg lang="la">viginti aurei</seg>=nearly $90; but it was an antiquarian curiosity, as being reputed Vergil's own copy; and as a literary tradition, possibly untrue, it was said that Aristotle gave three talents for an autograph MS. of Speusippus, and Plato nearly two for three books of Philolaüs ( <bibl n="Gel.  3. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 17</bibl>). Such instances merely show that bibliophiles lived <figure id="fig.00951.2">
<head orig="Libri. (From paintings at Pompeii.)">Libri. (From paintings at Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> then as now, and price was regulated by fashion and rarity. Trustworthy copies of Ennius, for instance, were so rare in the time of Gellius that one of undoubted authority was hired for a large sum to decide a dispute as to a reading ( <bibl n="Gel.  17. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xvii. 5</bibl>). That, on the other hand, the real cost of production was not great, may be seen from the fact that Statius ( <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 4. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Silv.</title>iv. 9</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> Silv., 9</bibl>) speaks of a book in a neat purple cover costing about ten cents. The first book of Martial, in the shop of Atrectus, cost five <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  1. 117" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 117</bibl>); but even that was dear, for the bookseller Tryphon could sell it at a profit for two ( <bibl n="Mart.  13. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiii. 3</bibl>). The author's profit could be made (1) by selling his original copy to a bookseller ( <title>De Ben.</title> vii. 6;  <bibl n="Suet. Gram. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Gram.</title>8</bibl>),</p>
 <p>(2) by selling 
<pb n="952" /><cb /> copies made by his own slaves; but in the absence of all legal protection, the gains so to be made were very small, and the author who sought profit from his writing depended mainly on the liberality of rich patrons.</p>
 <p>How early or to what extent booksellers existed at Athens is a matter of dispute. It is not unreasonable to deduce, from the mention of <foreign lang="greek">βιβλιογράφοι</foreign> in Cratinus ( <bibl n="Poll.  7. 211" default="NO">Poll.vii. 211</bibl>), that they existed as early as B.C. 430. This name, for which <foreign lang="greek">βιβλιοπώλης</foreign> was afterwards used, would imply that the first booksellers were copyists who both copied and sold books. We have a book-market (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ βιβλία</foreign>) at Athens in the time of Eupolis ( <bibl n="Poll.  9. 47" default="NO">Poll.ix. 47</bibl>); and the same may be inferred from the mention of the book-collector Eudemus in Xenophon ( <bibl n="Aristot.

<head orig="Liberāles Artes">Liberales Artes</head>

 <p> The origin of the liberal arts is to be sought in the school education of the Greeks. As early as the time of Solon, the distinction between <foreign lang="greek">γυμναστική</foreign>, the training of the body, and <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign>, the training of the soul, is to be met with. Out of <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign> was gradually developed the body of studies which embraced as its chief content the so-called liberal arts. By the time of Aristotle (B.C. 384-322) the educational doctrine of the Greeks reached its highest development, and his references to the liberal arts may be taken as exhibiting this doctrine in a representative and authoritative manner. He defines the liberal arts (<title>Politics</title>, viii. 1) as the proper studies for freemen who seek intellectual and moral excellence in general rather than what is immediately practical as the end of their education, thus drawing a distinction between liberal and technical education, and perhaps foreshadowing in his identification of liberal with general culture the contrast between a general and a specialized training.</p>
 <p>No exclusive list of seven or any other definite number of arts is to be found in any Greek writer, nor any reference to seven as the proper number of the liberal arts. However, it is plain that grammar was the inevitable first study in the list, and that it was followed by instruction in rhetoric and dialectics (logic). After these came the study of one or more of the following subjects: Arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy. Yet besides these seven, which long afterwards came to be known <cb /> as the seven liberal arts, we find mention of medicine as a liberal art and of architecture as a liberal art, while philosophy, which was the goal and completion of all the arts, is sometimes styled the liberal art <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg> (Aristot. <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>i. 2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>By the time of Varro (B.C. 116-27) and Cicero (B.C. 106-43), the liberal arts of the Greeks had become the recognized ground-work for the education of the Roman <seg lang="la">liber homo</seg>, or gentleman, and were commonly known as <seg lang="la">artes liberales, studia liberalia, liberales disciplinae</seg>, or <seg lang="la">liberales scientiae</seg>— terms which are not always identical in meaning, but which were used loosely to indicate the school studies of the Greeks. Of these expressions, <seg lang="la">artes liberales</seg> is the chief. The repository of information for the Romans regarding the Greek studies was Varro's monumental work, now lost, entitled <title>Libri Novem Disciplinarum.</title> According to Ritschl (<title>Opusc.</title> iii. 371), Varro's nine “disciplines” were grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astrology, music, medicine, and architecture. Astrology, of course, answers to astronomy, and Varro's list accordingly embraces medicine and architecture in addition to the seven arts previously enumerated.</p>
 <p>Passing on to the time of the early Empire, the course of the liberal arts may be traced with considerable clearness in the writings of the younger Seneca (B.C. 4-A.D. 65) and Quintilian (A.D. 35-95), and in Philo Iudaeus. By this time the liberal arts had become closely coördinated as a body of school instruction known as <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία</foreign>, or “encyclical education;” and although we have no evidence that their number was then consciously limited to seven, it is quite possible that Alexandrian influences were beginning to operate towards such a limitation.</p>
 <p>With the promulgation of Christianity the history of the liberal arts entered on a new phase. In the Western Church particularly there was a strong spirit of antagonism at the first, which gradually passed into qualified tolerance, and finally changed to active encouragement of the liberal arts on the ground that they ministered to higher spiritual truth. This transition is to be clearly seen in the writings of Augustine (A.D. 354-430), and it is also interesting to notice that although Varro is Augustine's great authority in all matters pertaining to the history of the liberal arts, he does not adhere to Varro's number of “disciplines.” Instead of Varro's nine, we find that Augustine's enumeration embraces only seven and yet without expressly limiting the arts to that number. In the famous treatise of Martianus Capella of Carthage, written before A.D. 439 and entitled <title>De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</title>, we find for the first time an express limitation of the arts to seven, though without attaching any significance to that number. The book of Martianus was a popularized account of Varro's nine disciplines, and from this list of nine Martianus explicitly excludes medicine and architecture on the ground that they were not liberal but utilitarian studies (Eyssenhardt's edition, pp. 332, 336). No mention of the number of the arts is to be found in Boethius (A.D. 480-525), although the name <seg lang="la">quadrivium</seg> for the four later studies of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy appears in his writings, and it is possible that the word <seg lang="la">trivium</seg> as the name for the three earlier studies—grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics—dates back to his time. Cassiodor(i)us (A.D. 480-575), in 
<pb n="953" /><cb />
 his work <title>De Artibus ac Disciplinis Liberalium Litterarum</title>, not only follows Martianus in limiting the arts to seven, but finds a mystical hint of their excellence in the text, “Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars” ( <bibl n="Cic. Prov. 9. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Prov.ix. 1</bibl>). The liberal arts thus became the seven supports of <title>Sapientia</title>, the higher spiritual philosophy. Isidore of Seville (died A.D. 636) copies after Cassiodor(i)us and expressly recognizes the arts as seven. Alcuin (A.D. 735-804), in the preface to his <title>Grammatica</title>, presses the interpretation of the text suggested by Cassiodor(i)us and finds the liberal arts in the Scriptures as a matter of direct interpretation. Alcuin's pupil, Rabanus Maurus, in his book <title>De Clericorum Institutione</title> (iii. 27), written in the year 819, after a full description of each of the seven arts, calls them <seg lang="la">septem artes liberales</seg>, apparently the first instance in history of the use of this term. The <seg lang="la">septem artes liberales</seg> are thus the ancient <seg lang="la">artes liberales</seg> Christianized, and to the end of the Middle Ages they remained the substance of school instruction, not being disturbed until the Renaissance.</p>
 <p>Grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics, which composed the <seg lang="la">trivium</seg>, were also named “arts” as distinguished from the four “disciplines” which made up the <seg lang="la">quadrivium.</seg> The term <seg lang="la">artes sermocinales</seg>, or the arts pertaining to expression, is another name for the <seg lang="la">trivium</seg>, and <seg lang="la">artes reales</seg>, or the substantial sciences, another name for the <seg lang="la">quadrivium.</seg> Still another name for the <seg lang="la">quadrivium</seg> is “mathematics.” Moreover, inasmuch as the seven arts culminated in the higher study of philosophy, it is clear that the ancient and mediaeval world not only entertained the distinction between literary studies, on the one side, and sciences, on the other, as well as the notion that both find their goal and completion in philosophical studies, but that in so doing they likewise laid down the lines upon which European university education was to be subsequently modelled.

 <p> Among the Romans the personification of Liberty; she had a temple on the Aventine. Her name was also given to the Atrium Libertatis, a place of public business which served, among other purposes, as an office of the censors. After it had been burned down under Augustus, it was rebuilt by Asinius Pollio, and the first public library in Rome was established within its walls. On coins Libertas is represented as a beautiful and richly adorned matron. At the end of the Republic, after the assassination of Caesar, she appears with a dagger and a cap of Liberty, or laurel wreath.

<head orig="Libertus">Libertus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπελεύθερος</foreign>). A freedman. <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. The Greeks had no special legal form for the process <cb /> of emancipating slaves, and consequently no legal differences in the status of freedmen. At Athens they took the position of resident aliens (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>), and lay under certain obligations to their liberators as patrons. They could be called to legal account for any injury done to their patrons, and if condemned could be given back to them as slaves, or sold by the State. In the latter case the price was paid to their liberators. Occasionally the State set free a slave or a body of slaves who had rendered an important public service, as in the case of those who fought in the battle of Arginusae and at Chaeronea ( <title>Ran.</title> 33, 192, 693; Dio Chrys. xv. 21). In such cases the owners of the slaves received compensation. The Greek inscriptions record the emancipation of more female than male slaves.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>. As a class, freedmen were called by the Romans <seg lang="la">libertini</seg>, but in relation to their former masters <seg lang="la">liberti</seg> (i. e. <seg lang="la">liberati</seg>). Slaves were emancipated either formally or informally. There were four kinds of formal emancipation: (1) By the <seg lang="la">manumissio vindicta</seg>, according to which the owner brought the slave before the praetor or some other competent official. In his presence a free citizen (usually an officer of the court) laid a staff (<seg lang="la">vindicta</seg>) on the slave's head and declared him free. The master, who was holding the slave by the hand, thereupon released him as symbolizing his assent (<seg lang="la">manu misit</seg>).</p>
 <p>(2) The <seg lang="la">manumissio censu</seg>, when the master formally caused the slave's name to be enrolled in the official list of citizens.</p>
 <p>(3) The <seg lang="la">manumissio testamento</seg>, where the master either bequeathed his freedom to the slave by will, or stipulated that the heir to the estate should free him.</p>
 <p>(4) In later times, a form called <seg lang="la">manumissio in ecclesia</seg> was introduced by the emperor Constantine. Here the owner emancipated the slave in the presence of the congregation.</p>
 <p>Informal mancipation was emancipation brought about by a verbal statement of the master in the presence of friends (<seg lang="la">manumissio inter amicos</seg>), or by letter (<seg lang="la">per epistulam</seg>), or by an invitation to the slave to dinner (<seg lang="la">in convivio</seg>).</p>
 <p>After formal emancipation freedmen at once became Roman citizens and members of the city tribes and of the lowest classes in the <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>, with full right of voting; but, not being free born, they were not eligible to office, and were excluded from military service. The latter was, however, the case only till the first century B.C. They obtained the right to be enrolled in the country tribes several times in the republican period, but not permanently till the imperial age. Their descendants, however, were, as being free-born (<seg lang="la">ingenui</seg>), admitted into all the tribes, and in the second, or at least in the third generation, eligible to office. Informal emancipation conferred only practical freedom without civic rights. It was not until A.D. 17, under Tiberius, that freedmen of this kind won the <seg lang="la">commercium</seg>, or the right of acquiring and transferring property. Even then they had no power of testamentary bequest, and their property, at their death, went to their liberators. It was permissible, however, to pronounce a formal emancipation after their death.</p>
 <p>To obviate abuses, and to check the excessive increase in the number of freedmen, the right of manumission was limited in several directions under Augustus. Among other things, if a slave under thirty years of age was to be manumitted <seg lang="la">vindicta</seg>, a proof of sufficient reason was required; and, in case of testamentary manumission, the number was limited to a certain proportion of the whole number of slaves, and never allowed to exceed one hundred.
<pb n="954" /><cb /></p>
 <p>A mutual obligation continued to exist between the freedman and his liberator, based on the fact that the freedman belonged to the family of his patron. This is seen in the circumstance that the freedman assumed the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> and the <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> of his patron. In and after the first century B.C. we generally find a Greek <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> added. A well-known freedman of Lucius Cornelius Sulla , for instance, was called Lucius Cornelius Epicadus. The <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> was bound on his side to care for his <seg lang="la">libertus</seg>, and in consequence either retained him altogether in his home and service, or supplied him with a farm and capital to start it; buried him in the family tomb after his death, and took charge of his children if not grown up. On the other side the freedman was bound to support his <seg lang="la">patronus</seg>, in case of need, out of his own resources, and if he was reduced to poverty to maintain him. If the freedman died childless, the patron inherited his property; but the rights of the patron in respect to his freedman did not pass to his patron's heirs. If a freedman neglected his duty towards his patron, he was liable to severe punishment, and in some cases might be sold for his patron's benefit, or re-enslaved to him.</p>
 <p>The manumission of slaves was a source of much profit to the State, as a tax of five per cent. on the value of the slave was paid into the treasury after his liberation.</p>

<head orig="Libēthra">Libethra</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Λείβηθρα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Λίβηθρα</foreign>). (1) A city of Macedonia, situated, according to Pausanias (ix. 30), on the declivity of Olympus, and not far from the tomb of Orpheus. An oracle declared that when the sun beheld the bones of the poet the city should be destroyed by a boar (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπὸ συός</foreign>). The inhabitants of Libethra ridiculed the prophecy as a thing impossible; but the column of Orpheus's monument having been accidentally broken, a gap was made by which light broke in upon the tomb, when the same night the torrent named Sus, being prodigiously swollen, rushed down with violence from Mount Olympus upon Libethra, overthrowing the walls and all the public and private edifices, and every living creature in its furious course. Whether Libethra recovered from the devastation occasioned by this inundation is not stated in any writer, but its name occurs in Livy as a town in the vicinity of Dium before the battle of Pydna (xliv. 5). It would seem that the name of Libethrius was given to the summit of Olympus, which stood above the town, and probably transferred thence to the Boeotian Mountains, afterwards styled Libethrius Mons (Pausan. ix. 34). Hence the muses were surnamed Libethrides as well as Pierides ( <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 7. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>vii. 21</bibl>).</p>

 <p> An ancient Italian goddess of voluptuous delight and of gardens, vineyards, and vintages, originally connected with Venus, and therefore often called Venus Libitina. She was also regarded as the goddess of death and of the departed, and was therefore afterwards identified with Proserpina. By an ancient ordinance, asscribed originally to Servius Tullius, for every person who died in Rome a piece of money was deposited in her temple. Everything requisite for burials was kept there, and had to be bought or borrowed from it. Hence a person undertaking the burial of a person (an undertaker) was called <seg lang="la">libitinarius</seg>, and his business <hi rend="italic">libitina;</hi> whence the expression <seg lang="la">libitina funeribus non sufficiebat</seg>—i. e. they could not all be buried. Owing to the connection of Libitina with the dead, the Roman poets frequently employ her name in the sense of death itself.

Shortly afterwards he accompanied Pompey to Greece, and was actively engaged in the war that ensued. On the death of Bibulus (B.C. 48) he had the chief command of the Pompeian fleet. In the Civil Wars which followed Caesar's death, he followed the fortunes of his son-in-law Sex. Pompey. In B.C. 40 Octavianus married his sister Scribonia, and this marriage was followed by a peace between the triumvirs and Pompey (39). When the war was renewed in 36, Libo for a time continued with Pompey, but, seeing his cause hopeless, he deserted him in the following year. In 34 he was consul with M. Antonius.

Here are also 3000 <cb /> MSS. brought to the Vatican from Heidelberg in 1623. In 1655 the greater part of the library of Duke Federigo of Urbino was purchased by Pope Alexander VII. The collection of Queen Christina of Sweden added 1900 MSS. The last great addition was in 1856, when Pope Pius IX. added 40,000 volumes that had belonged to Cardinal Mai. In 1894, the whole number of MSS. of all kinds in the Vatican Library was more than 26,000, of which some 19,000 are Latin, 4000 Greek, and 2000 Oriental. The printed books number about 220,000. No complete catalogue has yet been made.—The <title>Laurentian Library</title> at Florence, founded in 1444 by Cosimo de Medici, contains some 10,000 Greek and Latin MSS., among them early codices of Vergil (fourth or fifth century), Tacitus, Cicero's letters <seg lang="la">ad familiares</seg>, the Pandects, and Aeschylus.

He brought the contest between the patricians and plebeians to a happy termination, and thus became the founder of <cb /> Rome's greatness. He was tribune of the people from B.C. 376 to 367, and was faithfully supported in his exertions by his colleague, L. Sextius. The laws which he proposed were: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) That in future no more consular tribunes should be appointed, but that consuls should be elected, one of whom should always be a plebeian. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) That no one should possess more than 500 <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> of the public land, or keep upon it more than 100 head of large, and 500 of small cattle.

These rogations were passed after a vehement opposition on the part of the patricians, and L. Sextius was the first plebeian who obtained the consulship, 366. Licinius himself was elected twice to the consulship, 364 and 361. Some years later he was accused by M. Popilius Laenas of having transgressed his own law respecting the amount of public land which a person might possess. He was condemned and sentenced to pay a heavy fine (<bibl n="Liv.  6. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vi. 35</bibl>; vii. 1<bibl n="Liv.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 9</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  16" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 16</bibl>; Val.

His elegies were very warmly extolled by Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid. All his works are lost.

 <head><surname full="yes">Lipsius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Justus</foreName>
 <p>, the Latinized form of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Joest Lips</hi>. A great humanist, born at Overyssche in Brabant, October 18, 1547. Educated at the Jesuit College of Cologne and the University of Louvain, he obtained, at the age of twenty, the office of Latin Secretary to Cardinal Granvella, to whom he had dedicated his first work, <bibl default="NO"><title>Variarum Lectionum Libri III.</title> (1567)</bibl>. With the cardinal he visited Rome, and for two years studied the Latin classics and collected inscriptions in that city. He also familiarized himself with the great collection of MSS. in the Vatican, and his book, published in 1575, <title>Antiquarum Lectionum Libri V.</title>, showed his familiarity with some of the greater principles and <cb /> methods of text criticism—the collation, emendation, and classification of codices.</p>
 <p>After making the acquaintance in Rome of such scholars as Muretus, Paulus Manutius, and Fulvio Orsini, he travelled in 1570 over Burgundy, Germany, Austria, and Bohemia, for the sake of meeting the great classicists of those countries. A little later he taught at the University of Jena for a year, and in 1579 received a call to the University of Leyden as Professor of History. This chair he held for eleven years, during which period his literary productiveness was very great, his numerous works being issued from the celebrated press of Plantin of Antwerp. In 1591 he left Leyden because of his failing health, and after travelling about from place to place, and refusing many calls from the courts and universities of Italy, Austria, and Spain, accepted the Latin chair at the Collegium Buslidianum at Louvain, with the understanding that he was not to be required to teach. With this appointment he coupled that of PrivyCouncillor and Historiographer to the king of Spain. He died at Lonvain, March 23, 1606.</p>
 <p>Lipsius was the master of an epigrammatic and fascinating Latin style, and his writings were always readable. His great favourite of the classical authors was Tacitus, the whole of whose writings he could repeat from memory, and used to offer to do so with a dagger at his breast to stab him if he made a single error. His range as a scholar, however, was limited. He knew little Greek, though ostentatiously parading Greek quotations in his Latin letters, and he was wholly un-Ciceronian in his Latinity. He had no ear for metre and cared little for the poets. His general knowledge of classical antiquity was also comparatively slight. Nevertheless, he was ranked among the most noted scholars of his age, and with Scaliger and Casaubon formed the so-called “Triumvirate.” His chief strength lay in his knowledge of the Roman histories and of Roman antiquities in the narrow sense of the word. His two most elaborate works are his edition of Tacitus <bibl default="NO">(1574)</bibl>, which was five times revised by him, the last edition appearing in 1606; and of Seneca <bibl default="NO">(Antwerp, 1605)</bibl>. The former work is almost epoch-making in the completeness and elaboration of its exhaustive commentary. He also edited Valerius Maximus <bibl default="NO">(Antwerp, 1585)</bibl> and Velleius Paterculus <bibl default="NO">(Leyden, 1591, and 1607)</bibl>. His complete works appeared in 4 vols. at Antwerp in 1637, reprinted at Wesel in 1675 with his life by Le Mire.

<head orig="Liturgia">Liturgia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λειτουργία</foreign>—i. e. “service performed for the public”). A term applied at Athens to either an ordinary or extraordinary service, which the State imposed on its wealthier citizens in accordance with a regular rotation. The ordinary services, which citizens whose property amounted to more than three talents ($3500) were required to perform, are: (1) The <ref type="cross" target="crosschoregia">Choregia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">χορηγία</foreign>), the most expensive service of this kind, involving the equipment of a <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">chorus</ref> (q.v.) for its musical competitions at public festivals, which were accompanied by theatrical and musical performances.</p>
 <p>(2) The <ref type="cross" target="crossgymnasiarchia">Gymnasiarchia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">γυμνασιαρχία</foreign>), which imposed the obligation of training in the Gymnasia the competitors for the gymnastic contests, supplying them with proper diet while they were in training, and providing at the games themselves for the requisite arrangement and decoration of the scene of the contest. The most expensive type of this form of service was the lampadarchy (<foreign lang="greek">λαμπαδαρχία</foreign>), the equipment of the torch race (q. v.), which in one instance (recorded in Lysias, <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 21. 3" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>21. 3</bibl>) cost twelve <seg lang="la">minae</seg> ($200).</p>
 <p>(3) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Architheoria</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιθεωρία</foreign>), or superintendence of the sacred embassies (<foreign lang="greek">θεωρίαι</foreign>), sent to the four great national festivals, or to Delos and other holy places. In this case the State contributed part of the expense. There were other liturgies confined to the separate tribes and demes, such as the entertainment of members of the clan on festal occasions.</p>
 <p>The most expensive of all was the extraordinary liturgy called the <ref type="cross" target="crosstrierarchia">Trierarchia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">τριηραρχία</foreign>), which was necessary mainly in times of war. This involved the equipment of a ship of war, and was required of the wealthiest citizen only. Before the Persian Wars the equipment of the forty-eight to fifty ships of the Athenian navy of that time devolved on the <hi rend="italic">naucrariae</hi> (q. v.). When the number of the fleet was increased, the necessary number of trierarchs was nominated in each year by the strategi. The State provided the vessel—i. e. the hull and mast; and every trierarch had to fit out <cb /> this vessel with the necessary equipment, to keep it in readiness for the year, and to man it with a complete crew of oarsmen and others. The State supplied pay and provision for the crew, though the sum paid did not always suffice for the purpose; it afterwards supplied the furniture of the vessel also. To lighten the expense, which amounted to between forty minae and a talent ($665-$1180), it became allowable, about B.C. 411, for two persons to share it. Afterwards, in 358, twenty <hi rend="italic">symmoriae</hi> (q. v.) were instituted—i. e. companies consisting of sixty citizens each, with a committee of the 300 wealthiest citizens at their head; the 300 distributed the expense over the individual <hi rend="italic">symmoriae</hi> in such sort that the cost of a single trireme was shared by a greater or less number of citizens. Lastly, about B.C. 340, the incidence of the burden was regulated by a law introduced by Demosthenes, whereby all citizens, with the exception of the poorer classes, bore the expense in proportion to their property. Thus property (or rather taxable capital) amounting to ten talents imposed the obligation of equipping one vessel, twenty talents two vessels, and so on. Those who had less than ten talents were to club together and to make up that amount among them.</p>
 <p>The time of service lasted, as has been already stated, for one year. On its expiration, the trierarch, who had looked after the vessel, was responsible to the <ref type="cross" target="crosslogistae">Logistae</ref> (q.v.) for the condition of the vessel, and had to hand in his account of the expenditure of the sums paid by the State. Another board, the <hi rend="italic">epimeletae</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">neoria</hi> (the inspectors of the dock-yards), superintended the regular fulfilment of the duties of the trierarchs, and were armed for this purpose with compulsory powers.</p>
 <p>No one was compelled to undertake more than one liturgy at the same time, or two in two immediately successive years. The only persons exempt from the trierarchy were the archons, unmarried heiresses, and orphans up to the end of the first year after they had come of age. The obligation to see that the liturgy was discharged in each particular case fell on the tribe concerned. If any one considered that he had been unfairly chosen for this duty, and a wealthier person passed over, he could resort to the form of challenge to exchange properties known as the <hi rend="italic">antidosis</hi> (q. v.). See the introduction to the oration of Demosthenes, <title>Adv. Leptinem</title>, in the edition of Sandys, pp. ii.-xviii.; and Wolf's <title>Prolegomena</title> to the same oration.

Livius Drusus, a tribune, B.C. 92, about transplanting colonies to different parts of Italy and Sicily, and granting corn to poor citizens at a low price; also, that the <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> should be chosen indiscriminately from the senators and equites, and that the allied States of Italy should be admitted to the freedom of the city. Drusus was a man of great eloquence and of the most upright intentions; but, endeavouring to reconcile those whose interests were diametrically opposite, he was crushed in the attempt, being murdered by an unknown assassin in his own house, upon his return from the Forum, amid a number of clients and friends. No inquiry was made about his death. The States of Italy considered this event the signal for a revolt, and endeavoured to extort by force the privileges which they could not obtain voluntarily. Above 300,000 men fell in the contest in the space of two years. At last the Romans, although upon the whole they had the advantage, were obliged to grant the freedom of the city, first to the allies, and afterwards to all the States of Italy (Vell. Paterc. ii. 13 foll.; <bibl n="Flor.  3. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.iii. 18</bibl>).

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossandronicus">Andronīcus</ref>. An early writer who is regarded as the founder of Roman epic and dramatic poetry. He was by birth a Greek of Southern Italy, and was brought as a slave to Rome, after the conquest of Tarentum in B.C. 272, while still a young man. His master, a Livius (perhaps Livius Salinator), whose name he bears, gave him his liberty, and he became an instructor in the Greek and Latin languages. This employment probably gave occasion for his translation of the <title>Odyssey</title> into Saturnian verse, which, in spite of its imperfections, remained a school-book in Rome for centuries. The first verse runs as follows: <lb />“Virum mihi, Camena, insece versutum.”</p>
 <p>In B.C. 240 he brought upon the Roman stage the first drama composed after a Greek model, and with such success that thenceforward dramatic poetry was well established in Rome. According to ancient custom he appeared as an actor in his own pieces. His dramatic compositions, tragedies, and comedies were faithful but undoubtedly imperfect translations of Greek originals. He attempted lyric poetry also, for he was commissioned by the State to write a march in honour of Iuno Regina. Scanty remains of his works are all that have come down to us; and these are collected by Ribbeck in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Scaenicae Romanorum Poesis Fragmenta</title> (Leipzig, 1873)</bibl>, and Bährens, <title>Frag. Poetarum Romanorum</title>, pp. 37-43 <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1886)</bibl>. See, also, Wordsworth's <bibl default="NO"><title>Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin</title> (Oxford, 1874)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus</hi>. One of the greatest and certainly the most popular of the Roman writers of history. He was born at Patavium (B.C. 59), of good family, and, after being carefully educated, betook himself early (before B.C. 31) to Rome, where he soon became acquainted with the most distinguished men of the day. Even Augustus 
<pb n="963" /><cb /> entertained friendly relations towards him in spite of his openly expressed republican convictions, for which he called him a partisan of Pompey. He does not seem to have taken public office, but to have lived exclusively for literature. He was esteemed by his contemporaries so highly that a Spaniard is said to have travelled from Gades (Cadiz) to Rome merely to see him (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> ii. 3). He died in his native town in A.D. 17. He must have begun his great historical work between B.C. 27 and 25; it can only have been completed shortly before his death, as he did not publish the first twenty-one books until after the death of Augustus (A.D. 14). It recounts the history of Rome in 142 books, extending from the foundation of the city (whence the title <title>Ab Urbe Condita Libri</title>) to the death of Drusus (A.D. 9). His own death must have prevented its continuation to the death of Augustus, as he doubtless had proposed. He published the work, called by himself <title>Annales</title> (xliii. 13), from time to time, in separate parts, arranging his material—at least for the first ninety books—as far as possible in decades (portions consisting of ten books), and half-decades; the division into decades was, however, first carried through in the fifth century, probably for convenience of handling so vast a series of books. There still remain only the first decade (to B.C. 293), the third, fourth, and half of the fifth decade (218-167); and of the remainder, with the exception of a fairly large portion of the ninety-first book, only inconsiderable fragments. We also possess from an unknown pen, epitomes (<hi rend="italic">periochae</hi>) of all the books except 136 and 137, and a scanty extract from the account of the portents (<seg lang="la">prodigia</seg>), which appeared in B.C. 249 and following year. This is by a certain Iulius Obsequens, and perhaps dates from the fourth century.</p>
 <p>Livy 's importance rests more on the magnitude of his patriotic undertaking and the charm of his style than on his acquisitions as a scientific historian. He is, in fact, best regarded as a remarkable story-teller, who possessed a diction almost perfect in its way, and an unusual power of graphic narrative. For writing history, however, he had no special training, and his knowledge of Roman law and of the Roman military system was but slight. In selecting his authorities, also, he showed little discrimination, basing his judgment of them on <seg lang="la">a priori</seg> assumptions. Thus he follows Valerius Antias in the first decade with no mistrust (cf. vii. 36; ix. 27, 37, 43), but later denounces him as a falsifier (xxvi. 49; xxx. 19; xxxiii. 10, etc.). He does, however, use Polybius, besides Licinius Macer , Quadrigarius, and Caelius Antipater, but often draws different portions of his narrative from conflicting accounts, so that there are frequent inconsistencies to be noticed. It is evident that he had never read the <title>Leges Regiae</title> or even many important laws of later times. His purpose, however, was not at all to write a critical history, but rather, by a lively and brilliant narrative, to rekindle the patriotic spirit among his countrymen and to inspire them with a desire to emulate the deeds of their heroic ancestors. From this standpoint, his history deserves the highest praise, and justly won for him the name of “the Roman Herodotus.” The only criticism of any account that has come down to us is that of Asinius Pollio recorded by Quintilian (i. 5, 56 and viii. 1, 3), which charges the historian with displaying in his writings <cb /> a certain Patavinity (<title>Patavinitas</title>, from Patavium, Padua, Livy 's birthplace). Just what this criticism was meant to imply is not clearly known. It may have been intended to characterize the style as being more florid than was consistent with the reserve of a Roman gentleman, or it may refer to the presence of provincialisms, which we are not now able to detect as such. It may, as some think, have marked the enthusiasm of the writer as opposed to the polished and self-contained <seg lang="la">urbanitas</seg> of the metropolis. On this point, see Wiedemann, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Patavinitate Livii</title> (Görlitz, 1848-54)</bibl>; and Moritz Haupt, <title>Opuscula</title>, ii. 69.</p>
 <p>Of Livy's history, the first decade (books one to ten) is entire. It embraces the period from the foundation of the city to the year B.C. 294, when the subjugation of the Samnites may be said to have been completed. The second decade (books eleven to twenty) is altogether lost. It embraced the period from 294 to 219, comprising an account, among other matters, of the invasion of Pyrrhus and of the First Punic War. The third decade (books twenty-one to thirty) is entire. It embraces the period from 219 to 201, comprehending the whole of the Second Punic War. The fourth decade (books thirty-one to forty) is entire, and also one half of the fifth (books forty-one to forty-five). These fifteen books embrace the period from 201 to 167, and develop the progress of the Roman arms in Cisalpine Gaul, in Macedonia, Greece, and Asia, ending with the triumph of Aemilius Paulus. Of the other books nothing remains except inconsiderable fragments, the most notable being a few chapters of the ninety-first book, concerning the fortunes of Sertorius. The composition of so vast a work necessarily occupied many years; and we find indications which throw some light upon the epochs when different sections were composed. Thus, in the first book (ch. 19), it is stated that the temple of Ianus had been closed twice only since the reign of Numa—for the first time in the consulship of T. Manlius (B.C. 235), a few years after the termination of the First Punic War; for the second time by Augustus Caesar, after the battle of Actium, in 29. But we know that it was shut again by Augustus, after the conquest of the Cantabrians, in 25; and hence it is evident that the first book must have been written between the years 29 and 25. Moreover, since the last book contained an account of the death of Drusus, it is evident that the task must have been spread over seventeen years, and probably occupied a much longer time.</p>
 <p>The discovery of the lost books of Livy has been a dream of scholars for many centuries, and may yet be realized. In the sixteenth century a complete Livy was reported to be in existence in a monastery in Denmark, where two travellers independently professed to have seen it; but inquiry failed to verify the claim.</p>
 <p>Among the most famous <ref type="cross" target="crossmanuscripts">manuscripts</ref> of Livy now in existence are a Codex Mediceus and a Co dex Parisinus, each of the eleventh century. Portions of bks. iii.-vi. are preserved in a very old palimpsest at Verona. The third decade is preserved in a MS. now in Paris (the Codex Puteaneus) of the eighth century, and in a Mediceus of the eleventh century. The fourth decade is known from a Codex Moguntinus (Mayence), now lost, and from a MS. at Bamberg. What is preserved of the fifth decade is in a sixth-century MS. at Vienna.

An ancient Greek city in Lower Italy, situated in the southeast of Bruttium, north of the promontory of Zephyrium, from which it was said to have derived its surname Epizephyrii, though others suppose this name was given to the place simply because it lay to the west of Greece. It was founded by the Locrians from Greece, B.C. 683. The inhabitants regarded themselves as descendants of Aiax Oïleus; and as he resided at the town of Naryx among the Opuntii, the poets gave the name of Narycia Locri. For the same reason the pitch of Bruttium is frequently called Narycia. Locri was celebrated for the excellence of its laws, which were drawn up by Zaleucus soon after the foundation of the city.

<head orig="Logogrăphi">Logographi</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign>, i. e. writers in prose). The name given to the oldest Greek historians, who by their first attempts at disquisitions in prose marked the transition from narrative poetry to prose history ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 21</bibl>). As in the case of epic poetry, so these earliest historical writings emanated from Ionia, where the first attempts at an exposition of philosophic reflections in prose were made at about the same time by Pherecydes, Anaximander, and Anaximenes; and, in both cases alike, it was the Ionic dialect that was used. This class of writing long preserved in its language the poetic character which it inherited from its origin in the epic narrative. It was only by degrees that it approached the tone of true prose. It confined itself absolutely to the simple telling of its story, which was largely made up of family and local traditions. It never classified its materials from a more elevated point of view, or scrutinized them <cb /> with critical acumen. The logographers flourished from about B.C. 550 down to the Persian Wars. Their latest representatives extend, however, down to the time of the Peloponnesian War. When true history arose with Herodotus, they soon lapsed into oblivion, whence they were rescued in Alexandrian days. Many of the works ascribed to them were, however, believed to be spurious, or at least interpolated. There remain fragments only of a few. The larger number of the historic writers who are described as logographers were Asiatic Greeks, e. g. Cadmus of Miletus, author of a history of the founding of Miletus and the colonization of Ionia (he lived about B.C. 540, and was considered the first writer of historic prose); further, Dionysus of Miletus, a writer of Persian history; <ref type="cross" target="crosshecataeus">Hecataeus</ref> (q.v.) of Miletus (550-476); Xanthus of Sardis (about 496), a writer of Lydian history; <ref type="cross" target="crosshellanicus">Hellanicus</ref> (q.v.) of Lesbos (about 480-400); Charon of Lampsacus (about 456), a compiler of Persian history and annals of his native town; Pherecydes of the Carian island Leros (died about B.C. 400), who lived at Athens, and in his great collection of myths in ten books treated chiefly of the early days of Attica. Some belonged to the colonies in the West—e. g. Hippys of Rhegium, at the time of the Persian War the oldest writer on Sicily and Italy. The only representative from Greece itself is Acusilaüs of Argos in Boeotia, the author of a genealogical work. The scanty remains of the logographers are collected by Müller in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</title> (Paris, 1856)</bibl>.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Londīnum.</hi> The modern London, the capital of the Cantii in Britain, originally situated on the southern bank of the Thames in the modern Southwark. It afterwards spread over the north side of the river, and was hence called a town of the Trinobantes. It is first mentioned in the reign of Nero as a flourishing and populous town, much frequented by Roman merchants. It was taken and its inhabitants massacred by the Britons when they revolted under Boadicea, A.D. 62. The quarter on the north side of the river was surrounded with a wall and ditch by Constantine the Great or Theodosius, the Roman governor of Britain. This wall probably commenced at a fort near the present site of the Tower, and continued along the Minories to Cripplegate, Newgate, and Ludgate. London was the

It possessed a <title>Milliarium Aureum</title>, from which the miles on the roads were numbered; and a fragment of this Milliarium, the celebrated London Stone, may be seen affixed to the wall of St. Swithin's Church in Cannon Street.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dionysius Cassius</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Αογγῖνος</foreign>). A Greek rhetorician, born at Athens about A.D. 213, who studied Neoplatonism at Alexandria, and practised as teacher of philosophy, grammar (i. e. literary criticism), <cb /> and rhetoric, in his native city, from about 260, until the accomplished queen Zenobia of Palmyra summoned him as minister to her court. As he persuaded her to resist the Roman yoke, the emperor Aurelian caused him to be executed after Zenobia's overthrow in 273. He possessed such an extent of learning that Eunapius called him a living library and a walking museum. His versatility is proved by compositions on philosophy, grammar, rhetoric, chronology, and literature. Of these, only fragments are extant, for example, the introduction to a commentary on Hephaestion's handbook of metres, and a short Rhetoric incomplete at the beginning. A brief treatise <title>On the Sublime</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὕψους</foreign>), commonly ascribed to him, is more probably to be assigned to an unknown writer about the Christian era.

 <p> A district in Lower Italy, bounded on the north by Campania and Samnium, on the east by Apulia and the Gulf of Tarentum, on the south by Bruttium, and on the west by the Tyrrhene Sea. It was separated from Campania by the river Silarus, and from Bruttium by the river Laus. Lucania was celebrated for its excellent pastures; and its oxen were the finest and largest in Italy. Hence the elephant was at first called by the Romans a Lucanian ox (<title>Lucas bos</title>). The coast of Lucania was inhabited chiefly by Greeks, whose cities were numerous and flourishing. The interior of the country was originally inhabited by the Chones and Oenotrians. The Lucanians proper were Samnites, a brave and warlike race, who left their mother country and settled both in Lucania and Bruttium. They not only expelled or subdued the Oenotrians, but they gradually acquired possession of most of the Greek cities on the coast. They were subdued by the Romans after Pyrrhus had left Italy. The chief cities of Lucania were Heraclea, Metapontum, Thurii, Elea or Velia, Paestum (Posidonia), and Buxentum.

 <head><surname full="yes">Lucānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">M. Annaeus</foreName>
 <p>, usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucan</hi>, a Roman poet, was born at Corduba in Spain, A.D. 39. His father was L. Annaeus Mella, a brother of M. Seneca, the philosopher. Lucan was carried to Rome at an early age, where his education was superintended by the most eminent preceptors of the day. His talents developed themselves at a very early age, and excited such general admiration as to awaken the jealousy of Nero, who, unable to brook competition, forbade him to recite in public. Stung to the quick by this prohibition, Lucan embarked in the famous conspiracy of Piso, was betrayed, and, by a promise of pardon, was induced to turn informer. He began by denouncing his own mother, Acilia or Atilia, and then revealed the rest of his accomplices without reserve. He received, however, a traitor's reward. After the more important victims had been despatched, the emperor issued a mandate for the death of Lucan, who, finding escape hopeless, caused his veins to be opened. When, from the rapid effusion of blood, he felt his extremities becoming cold, he began to repeat aloud some verses which he had once composed, descriptive of a wounded soldier perishing by a like death; and, with these lines upon his lips, expired A.D. 65, in the twentysixth year of his age.</p>
 <p>Lucan wrote various poems, the titles of which 
<pb n="968" /><cb />
 are preserved, and also prose works; but the only extant production is an epic poem, in ten books, entitled <title>Pharsalia</title>, in which the progress of the struggle between Caesar and Pompey is fully detailed, the events, commencing with the passage of the Rubicon, being arranged in regular chronological order. The tenth book is imperfect, and the narrative breaks off abruptly in the middle of the Alexandrian War; but it is not known whether the conclusion has been lost, or whether the author ever completed his task. The whole of what now remains was certainly not composed at the same time, for the different parts do not by any means breathe the same spirit. In the earlier portions we find liberal sentiments expressed in very moderate terms, accompanied by open and almost fulsome flattery of Nero; but as we proceed, the blessings of freedom are loudly proclaimed, and the invectives against tyranny are couched in language the most offensive, evidently aimed directly at the emperor. The work contains great beauties and great defects. It is characterized by copious diction, lively imagination, and a bold and masculine tone of thought; but it is at the same time disfigured by extravagance, far-fetched conceits, and forced similes. The hero of the poem is Cato , of whom the following very famous line of Lucan is written: <lb />Victrix causa diis placuit sed victa Catoni.</p>
 <p>The oldest MS. of Lucan is a palimpsest, perhaps as early as the fourth century, the leaves of which are distributed between Vienna, Naples, and Rome.

A large number of ancient lamps have come down to us, the greater part of which are made of terra-cotta (<foreign lang="greek">τροχήλατοι</foreign>), but also a considerable number of bronze. Most of the lamps are of an oval form and flat upon the top, on which there are frequently figures in relief. In the lamps there are one or more round holes, according to the number of wicks (<seg lang="la">ellychnia</seg>) burned in it; and as these holes were called, from an obvious analogy, <foreign lang="greek">μυκτῆρες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μύξαι</foreign>, literally, nostrils or nozzles, the lamp was also called <hi rend="italic">monomyxos, dimyxos, trimyxos</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">polymyxos</hi>, according as it contained one, two, three, or a greater number of nozzles or holes for the wicks.</p>

<div2 id="crosslucianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Luciānus">Lucianus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λουκιανός</foreign>), usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucian</hi>. A Greek writer, born at Samosata, the capital of Commagené, in Syria. The dates of his birth and death are uncertain; but it has been conjectured, with much probability, that he was born about A.D. 120, and that he lived till towards the end of that century. We know that some of his more celebrated works were written in the reign of M. Aurelius. Lucian's parents were poor, and he was at first apprenticed to his maternal uncle, who was a statuary. He afterwards became an advocate, and practised at Being unsuccessful in this calling, he employed himself in writing speeches for others, instead of delivering them himself. But he did not remain long at Antioch; and at an early period of his life he set out upon his travels, and visited the greater part of Greece, Italy, and Gaul. At that period it was customary for professors of the rhetorical art to proceed to different cities, where they attracted audiences by their displays, much in the same manner as musicians or itinerant lecturers in modern times. He appears to have acquired a good deal of money as well as fame. On his return to his native country, probably about his fortieth year, he abandoned the rhetorical profession, the artifices of which, he tells us, were foreign to his temper. He now devoted most of his time to the composition of his works. He still, however, occasionally travelled; for it appears that he was in Achaia and Ionia about the close of the Parthian War, 160-165, on which occasion, too, he seems to have visited Olympia, and beheld the self-immolation of Peregrinus. About the year 170, or a little previously, he visited the false oracle of the impostor Alexander, in Paphlagonia. Late in life he obtained the office of procurator of part of Egypt, which office was probably bestowed upon him by the emperor Commodus.</p>
 <p>The nature of Lucian's writings inevitably made for him many enemies, by whom he has been painted in the darkest colours. According to Suidas, he was surnamed “the Blasphemer,” and was torn to pieces by dogs, as a punishment for his impiety; but to this account no credence can be given. Other writers state that Lucian apostatized from Christianity; but there is no proof in support of this charge; and the dialogue entitled <title>Philopatris</title>, which would appear to prove that the author had once been a Christian, was certainly not written by Lucian, and was probably composed in the reign of Julian the Apostate.</p>
 <p>As many as eighty-two works have come down to us under the name of Lucian; but some of these are spurious. The most important of them are his <title>Dialogues.</title> They are of very various degrees of merit, and are treated in the greatest possible variety of style, from seriousness down to the broadest humour and buffoonery. Their subjects and tendency, too, vary considerably; for while some are employed in attacking the heathen philosophy and religion, others are mere pictures of manners without any polemic drift. Our limits only allow us to mention a few of the more important of these dialogues: The <title>Dialogues of the Gods</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεῶν Διάλογοι</foreign>), twenty-six in number, consist of short dramatic narratives of some of the most popular incidents in the heathen mythology. The reader, however, is generally left to draw his own conclusions from the story, the author only taking care to put it in the most absurd point of view.—In the <title>Zeus Convicted</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Ἐλεγχόμενος</foreign>) a bolder style of attack is adopted; <cb /> and the cynic proves to Zeus's face that everything being under the dominion of fate, he has no power whatever. As this dialogue shows Zeus's want of power, so the <title>Zeus the Tragedian</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Τραγῳδός</foreign>) strikes at his very existence, and that of the other deities.—The <foreign lang="greek">Βίων Πρᾶσις</foreign>, or <title>Sale of the Philosophers</title>, is an attack upon the ancient philosophers. In this humorous piece the heads of the different sects are put up for sale, Hermes being the auctioneer.—<title>The Fisherman</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἁλιεύς</foreign>) is a sort of apology for the preceding piece, and may be reckoned among Lucian's best dialogues. The philosophers are represented as having obtained a day's life for the purpose of taking vengeance upon Lucian, who confesses that he has borrowed the chief beauties of his writings from them.— <title>The Banquet</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Συμπόσιον</foreign>) is one of Lucian's most humorous attacks on the philosophers. The scene is a wedding feast, at which a representative of each of the principal philosophic sects is present. A discussion ensues, which sets all the philosophers by the ears, and ends in a pitched battle.—The <title>Nigrinus</title> is also an attack on philosophic pride; but its main purpose is to satirize the Romans, whose pomp, vainglory, and luxury are unfavourably contrasted with the simple habits of the Athenians.</p>
 <p>The more miscellaneous class of Lucian's dialogues, in which the attacks upon mythology and philosophy are not direct but incidental, or which are mere pictures of manners, contains some of his best. At the head must be placed <title>Timon</title>, which may perhaps be regarded as Lucian's masterpiece.—The <title>Dialogues of the Dead</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Νεκρικοὶ Διάλογοι</foreign>) are perhaps the best known of all Lucian's works. The subject affords great scope for moral reflection and for satire on the vanity of human pursuits. Wealth, power, beauty, strength, not forgetting the vain disputations of philosophy, afford the materials. Among the moderns these dialogues have been imitated by Fontenelle, Lord Lyttelton, and Walter Savage Landor.—The <title>Icaro-Menippus</title> is in Lucian's best vein and a masterpiece of Aristophanic humour. Menippus, disgusted with the disputes and pretensions of the philosophers, resolves on a visit to the stars for the purpose of seeing how far their theories are correct. By the mechanical aid of a pair of wings he reaches the moon, and thence surveys the miserable passions and quarrels of men. Thence he proceeds to Olympus, and is introduced to the Thunderer himself. Here he is witness of the manner in which human prayers are received in heaven. They ascend by enormous vent-holes, and become audible when Zeus removes the covers. Zeus himself is represented as a partial judge, and as influenced by the largeness of the rewards promised to him. At the end he pronounces judgment against the philosophers, and threatens in four days to destroy them all.—<title>Charon</title> is a much admired dialogue, but of a graver turn than the preceding. Charon visits the earth to see the course of life there, and what it is that always makes men weep when they enter his boat. Hermes acts as his cicerone. For his <title>True History</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀληθὴς Ἱστορία</foreign>) and <title>Asinus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Λούκιος ἢ Ὄνος</foreign>), see <ref type="cross" target="crossnovels-and-romances">Novels and Romances</ref>.</p>
 <p>Lucian's merits as a writer consist in his knowledge of human nature, his strong common-sense, the fertility of his invention, the raciness of his humour, and the simplicity and Attic grace of his diction. There was very much to justify his attacks 
<pb n="970" /><cb /> in the systems against which they were directed. Yet he establishes nothing in their stead. His aim is only to pull down; to spread a universal scepticism. Nor were his assaults confined to religion and philosophy, but extended to everything old and venerated, the poems of Homer and Hesiod, and the history of Herodotus.</p>

He was born at Suessa Auruncorum, B.C. 180, of good family; served in the Numantine War in Spain, under Scipio; and, returning to Rome, lived on familiar terms with that general and with his friend Laelius ( <bibl n="Enn.

 <p>It was Lucilius that first developed the <hi rend="italic">satira</hi>, which had before his time been a name applied to miscellaneous verse (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssatira">Satira</ref>) into the form in which it is afterwards found in Horace, Persius, and Juvenal.

 <p>Of his thirty books of satires, some 300 lines are preserved in a fragmentary state, giving us but a slight clue to his style and method; yet it is evident that he was a boldly original, almost eccentric, genius. He affected a cosmopolitanism unusual in a Roman of his time. “I write for the people of Cosentia and Tarentum and Sicily,” he says; and his Latin is liberally interlarded with Greek in a macaronic fashion. His vocabulary, in fact, is a very unusual one, abounding in strange words, disgusting expressions, and plebeian forms.</p>

Verus came as far as Ephesus to meet her, and the union was celebrated in that city, but, habituated to debauchery, Verus soon relapsed into his former mode of life; and Lucilla, finding herself neglected, took a woman's revenge, and entered on a career of similar licentiousness. Returning subsequently with her husband to Rome, she caused him to be poisoned there; and afterwards, in accordance with her father's directions, contracted a second marriage with Claudius Pompeianus, an aged senator, of great merit and probity. Her licentious conduct, however, underwent no change, and she was banished to the island of Capreae by her brother Commodus, against whom she had formed a conspiracy. Not long after, Commodus sent a centurion to her place of exile, who put her to death, in the thirty-eighth year of her age, A.D. 184 (Dio Cass. lxxi. 1; lxxii. 4;  <title>Aurel.</title> 7).

<div2 id="crosslucretius-carus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Lucretius Carus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Titus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman poet and philosopher who was born probably in B.C. 98 or 96; the year is uncertain. Of his birthplace and parentage nothing is known. St. Jerome is authority for the statement that he was made insane by a love-philter, and finally committed suicide, having composed some books in the intervals of his madness. According to Donatus, he died on the same day that Vergil assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>— October 15, B.C. 55.</p>
 <p>Lucretius left but one work, the <title>De Rerum Natura</title>, a didactic poem in six books containing in all nearly 7500 hexameter lines. The purpose of the poem is to set forth the Epicurean system of philosophy, particularly those portions dealing with the origin of the world and the operations of natural forces. The poet's aim in writing was, as he tells us, to free men's minds from the baneful influence of superstition and of the belief in the hereafter, to which he attributed the greater portion of the fears and troubles of life. He endeavoured to explain how, without the direction or intervention of supernatural agencies in any degree, all natural phenomena may be accounted for. In Book I, he lays down as fundamental truths the propositions that nothing can come from nothing, and that to nothing nought returns. The universe is made up of matter and void, or space. It has no centre, for matter exists in infinite quantity, and space is without limit. Matter is composed of atoms, which are inconceivably minute, perfectly solid, and indestructible. Book II. is devoted to an elaborate discussion of the atoms, treating of their movements, shapes, and combinations. Sensation and feeling are declared to be an accident of atomic combination, a result of the coming together of atoms of certain shapes in certain ways. 
<pb n="971" /><cb /> The subject of the third book is the mind and soul, which, according to the poet, are inseparably united and of material nature, being composed of the finest and roundest atoms. Many reasons are brought forward to prove that the soul perishes at the same time with the body. Book IV. deals with the phenomena of sense-perception. From the surface of all objects thin films of matter are continually flying off, preserving the general outline of that from which they come. These impinge upon our senses, and perception is an immediate result. Yet in the adaptation of the senses to their functions there is no evidence of design, no sign of creative intelligence. The fifth book sets forth the perishable nature of the world, its formation from a fortuitous concourse of atoms, the origin of life by spontaneous generation, the preservation of animal life in accordance with the law of the survival of the fittest, and the development of man in civilization out of a condition of brutish savagery. In Book VI. the poet attempts to explain the natural phenomena which seem most terrible and inexplicable, particularly thunder and lightning, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, the changes of the Nile, and the power of the magnet. The poem ends abruptly with a description of the plague at Athens, and was evidently given to the world before it had received the final revision of the author.</p>
 <p>In the matter of the poem Lucretius followed closely the teachings of Epicurus, whom he revered as guide and master. With a truly Roman spirit he laid more emphasis upon the reign of law in the universe than his teacher; but he made no contribution in the way of doctrine to the Epicurean system. Whether he intended to bring his work to a close with a presentation of the ethical views of Epicurus it is impossible to determine; but numerous references show that in these, also, the poet was fully in sympathy with his master. The form of the <title>De Rerum Natura</title> was perhaps suggested by that of the poem of Empedocles, <title>On Nature.</title> The thought and manner of expression reveal the influence of several Greek poets besides Empedocles (notably Homer and Euripides), and of the early Roman poets (particularly Ennius), as well as of Cicero's <title>Aratea.</title> Yet the poem throughout bears the stamp of a marked individuality. Believing deeply himself in the mission of Epicureanism as a cure-all for human ills, Lucretius proclaimed its teachings with an almost religious fervor. Previous to his time this system of philosophy had received only scanty treatment in Latin, that, too, in barbarous prose. From the multitude of its technical details and the absence of a supernatural element, it seemed incapable of poetic handling. Nevertheless, Lucretius succeeded not only in presenting the main features of Epicurean physics and psychology with admirable clearness, but even in clothing them with a highly poetic form. There are, indeed, passages of unequal merit, and now and then the lack of the poet's finishing touches becomes unpleasantly apparent; yet from beginning to end the poem carries the reader along with a kind of epic movement and interest. It possesses a unity and continuity inconsistent with the tradition that it was composed “in lucid intervals;” still it is not impossible that the story of the poet's insanity and selfdestruction may reflect some tragic event of his life. The legend of the madness of Lucretius <cb /> was elaborated by Tennyson in a well-known poem.</p>
 <p>The <title>De Rerum Natura</title> ranks not only as one of the finest poems in the Latin language, but also as undoubtedly the greatest didactic poem of all literature. It is masterly in its grasp and handling of the subject-matter, elevated in tone, and finely poetic in expression and suggestion. As an earnest attempt to adapt Epicureanism to the needs of the Roman life, the <title>De Rerum Natura</title>— apart from its value and inspiration as literature —is of especial interest at the present time, when atomic materialism under a new form is again challenging the attention of the philosophic world. Its doctrines form a curious and instructive parallel to those of the advocates of materialistic evolution, and sometimes foreshadow in a striking manner the conclusions of modern science.</p>
 <p>The existing manuscripts of Lucretius are all derived from a single archetype, which has long since disappeared. From this at least three copies were made. One of these, a beautiful folio of the ninth century, is now at Leyden (called A by Munro). Another was the parent of a quarto MS. of the tenth century (B), also at Leyden, and of two others of which there are considerable fragments at Copenhagen and Vienna. The third copy was taken by Poggio to Italy in the fifteenth century, and became the ancestor of the numerous Italian MSS. of the <title>De Rerum Natura.</title> The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> of the poem was published about 1473 by Ferandus of Brescia. The most important of the early editions are the first Aldus <bibl default="NO">(1500)</bibl>, edited by Avancius, the Jiunta <bibl default="NO">(1512)</bibl> by Candidus , and those by Lambinus (Paris, 1563; 2d ed. 1565; 3d ed. 1570, often reprinted).

 <p>A Roman celebrated as the conqueror of Mithridates. He fought on the side of Sulla in the Civil Wars with the Marian party, was praetor B.C. 77, and consul in 74. In the latter year he received the conduct of the war against Mithridates, which he carried on for eight years with great success (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmithridates">Mithridates</ref>), but being unable to bring the war to a conclusion in consequence of the mutinous disposition of his troops, he was superseded in the command by Acilius Glabrio, B.C. 67. Glabrio, however, never <figure id="fig.00972">
<head orig="Lucullus. (Duruy.)">Lucullus. (Duruy.)</head>
</figure> took the command; but in the following year (66) Lucullus had to resign the command to Pompey, who had been appointed by the Manilian law to supersede both him and Glabrio. On his return to Rome, Lucullus devoted himself to a life of indolence and luxury, and lived in a style of extraordinary magnificence. He died in B.C. 57 or 56. He was the first to introduce cherries into Italy, which he had brought with him from Cerasus in Pontus.</p>
 <p>The name of Lucullus became and has continued proverbial for extravagant and studied luxury. His gardens in the suburbs of the city were extraordinary for their splendour; his villas at Tusculum and Naples were laid out with such lavish disregard of expense in constructing fishponds (<seg lang="la">piscinae</seg>), cutting through hills and rocks, and throwing out moles into the sea, that Pompey called him, in derision, “the Roman Xerxes.” His <cb /> domestic service was on a scale of equal magnificence. A single dinner cost him $10,000.</p>
 <p>Lucullus was not, however, a mere sensualist. He collected a fine library, which was open to the public; he enjoyed the conversation of philosophers and scholars, and himself wrote a work on the history of the Marsic War, composed in Greek. He was also the patron of the poet Archias, the friend of Cicero. His life was written by Plutarch, and in it may be found many curious anecdotes of this very remarkable and interesting man.

 <p> A term applied to the various contests and spectacles held in the Roman Circus and amphitheatre (<seg lang="la">ludi circenses</seg>) and those of the theatre (<seg lang="la">ludi scaenici</seg>) and stadium.</p>
 <p>Games were either public (<seg lang="la">publici</seg>) or private (<seg lang="la">privati</seg>). <hi rend="SmallCaps">Public games</hi> were originally ceremonials connected with religion, the oldest being the Equirria, in honour of Mars, and the Consualia, in honour of Consus. (See Equirria; <ref type="cross" target="crossconsualia">Consualia</ref>.) Games were frequently exhibited in fulfilment of a vow (<seg lang="la">ludi votivi</seg>). Such were the seven great celebrations of the republican period—the Ludi Magni (or Maximi), the Ludi Plebeii, the Ludi Cereales, the Ludi Apollinares, the Ludi Megalenses, the Ludi Florales, and the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae. (See below.) Under the Empire many new games were introduced—in honour of the emperor's birthday (<seg lang="la">ludi natalicii</seg>) and games instituted at the conclusion of a great war (e. g. <title>ludi Parthici, ludi Alemannici, ludi Sarmatici</title>, etc.).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Private games</hi> were those given by private individuals, and not by the emperor or by the State. The most usual private games were the <seg lang="la">ludi funebres</seg>, celebrated on the ninth day after death, and hence called <seg lang="la">ludi novendiales.</seg> Private games were also given by persons of high rank on any occasion of public thanksgiving (<seg lang="la">ludi honorarii.</seg>) Games given by the emperor for the benefit of invited guests alone were also classed as <seg lang="la">ludi privati.</seg></p>
 <p>Games were given in the Circus and amphitheatre, or in the theatre. Those in the Circus were races (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscircus">Circus</ref>); those in the amphitheatre were gladiatorial contests (see <ref type="cross" target="crossgladiatores">Gladiatores</ref>), or beast-baiting (see <ref type="cross" target="crossvenationes">Venationes</ref>). (For the theatrical games and contests, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscomoedia">Comoedia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshistrio">Histrio</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmimus">Mimus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspantomimus">Pantomimus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstragoedia">Tragoedia</ref>.)

 <p>The games originally lasted for one day only; but in the later days of the Republic the duration of them was greatly extended—e. g. the Ludi Magni, or Romani, to sixteen days, the Ludi Plebeii to fourteen, the Ludi Cereales to eight, etc. Under the Empire the games were often continued through the night—a custom which probably began with the Floralia (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, v. 361 foll.). 
<pb n="973" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The observance opened with a regular ritual, which was carefully carried out; and if it appeared that the <seg lang="la">instauratio</seg> had been in any way defective in form, the games were repeated (see Weissenborn on <bibl n="Liv.  23. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiii. 30</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  16" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 16</bibl>). The great games were administered by the consuls until B.C. 366, the date of the first creation of curule aediles. Down to the Empire, the praetors had charge of the Ludi Apollinares. The gladiatorial contests were frequently given under the direction of the quaestors.</p>
 <p>The cost of the games was partly defrayed by the State from a special fund (<seg lang="la">lucar</seg>) originally formed from the income received from the sacred groves. The rest of the expense was borne by the giver of the games—i. e. the officials whose duty it was to administer them. The outlay was often so great as to deter many persons from aspiring to the curule offices (Dio Cass. liii. 2). Martial tells us that the chariot-races sometimes cost 400,000 sesterces ($16,000). Symmachus spent nearly $400,000 in this way; and Justinian's games cost $1,000,000. For an account of the magnificence of these exhibitions, see Calpurnius, <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 7." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>vii.</bibl>; Dio Cass. lxviii. 15; Gibbon, ii. 58-60; and Friedländer, <title>Sittengeschichte</title>, ii. 319 foll. (2d ed.).</p>
 <p>At the games, the emperor occupied a private box (<seg lang="la">cubiculum</seg>), and it is probable that seats were reserved by law for magistrates (consuls, praetors, tribunes, etc.) and priests and Vestals. Free seats were sometimes given in perpetuity to a distinguished man and his descendants ( <title>Philipp.</title> ix. 7, 16). At ordinary games seats were (1) sold by the exhibitor to those who wished to avoid the crush;</p>
 <p>(2) given by him to his friends and to those who had by law a right to reserved places; or</p>
 <p>(3) opened free to the general public. Tickets for the first class of seats were often secured by speculators (<seg lang="la">locarii</seg>) and sold at a considerable advance. In early times, slaves were not allowed to attend the games; but this prohibition was afterwards either withdrawn or ignored. Roman citizens were obliged to wear the toga at the games; magistrates appeared in official costume. The exhibitor often gave presents to the spectators in the shape of things to be scrambled for (<seg lang="la">missilia</seg>). Cloaks could be worn over the toga in bad weather, and hats (<seg lang="la">causiae</seg>) as a protection from the sun. When the weather was bad and the wind so high that the awning (<seg lang="la">velarium</seg>) could not be used, the spectators were allowed to hold up their umbrellas (<seg lang="la">umbracula</seg>).</p>
 <p>The following are the principal games mentioned by the ancient writers:</p>
 <p>(1) <ref type="cross" target="crossludi-actiaci">Ludi Actiăci</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄκτια</foreign>). Games in honour of the Actian Apollo, decreed by Augustus in B.C. 31 after his victory over Antony at Actium. They consisted at Rome of horse-races, gymnastic contests, and occasionally of gladiatorial contests. They were held every fourth year (Dio Cass. li. 19). See <ref type="cross" target="crossactia">Actia</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Apollināres</hi>. Games established in B.C. 212, in accordance with a prophecy of the seer Marcius , in honour of Apollo, the averter of evil. They were originally <seg lang="la">ludi votivi</seg>, and were given by the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 12</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 2</bibl>). They were, to a large degree, a Greek festival. The <seg lang="la">decemviri sacris faciundis</seg> sacrificed with victims after the Greek fashion; the State supplied the victims, and also gave 12,000 <seg lang="la">asses</seg> to defray the expenses of the games, and the people aided with a small <cb /> subscription (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 12</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  12" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 12</bibl>-14). The next year the praetor L. Calpurnius Piso proposed that the games should be vowed each year, and hence the Calpurnii have the head of Apollo on their denarii (Mommsen, <title>Röm. Münzwesen</title>, pp. 580, 626). After this they were celebrated every year, but till B.C. 208 on no definite day. In consequence of a pestilence in that year, the praetor P. Licinius Varus voted that they should be held every year on a fixed day. That day was July 13, which always continued to be the last day on which these games were held. The number of days gradually increased from one till it finally reached eight, or perhaps nine. They were, for the most part, theatrical exhibitions from the very beginning (see the interesting story in Festus, s. v. <title>Thymelici</title>, p. 326 Müller); but sometimes there was a <seg lang="la">venatio</seg>, and Dio Cassius (xlviii. 33) speaks of a horse-race. In the Apollinarian games, held by Agrippa in B.C. 40, two days were given to the games of the Circus, during one of which the <title>ludus Troiae</title> was exhibited (Dio Cass. xlviii. 20).

 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Capitolīni</hi>. Livy states (v. 50<bibl n="Liv.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 4</bibl>) that in the year B.C. 390 (better 388), after the defeat of the Gauls, on the motion of Camillus, a decree of the Senate was passed that Ludi Capitolini should be instituted, inasmuch as Iupiter, the best and greatest, had preserved his settlement and citadel in a serious crisis, and that the dictator M. Furius should appoint for that purpose a <seg lang="la">collegium</seg>, consisting of those who dwelt in the Capitol and citadel (cf. <bibl n="Liv.  5. 52" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 52</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 11</bibl>). As being administered by a <seg lang="la">collegium</seg>, the Capitoline games were like the Circensian games of the Fratres Arvales. After B.C. 384, when Marius Capitolinus was condemned, a motion was brought before the people that no patrician should dwell in the citadel or the Capitol (<bibl n="Liv.  6. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vi. 20</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 3</bibl>), so that from this time only plebeians could be members of this <seg lang="la">collegium.</seg></p>
 <p>For the guild of the Capitolini, see  <bibl n="Cic.  Q. fr. 2. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Q. Fr.</title>ii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Cic.  Q. fr. 2." default="NO" valid="yes"> Q. Fr., 2.</bibl>They had <seg lang="la">magistri</seg> of their own. Preller (<title>Röm. Myth.</title> 202) thinks this is a very old festival in honour of Iupiter Capitolinus, so old that it was attributed to Romulus (cf. <title>Spect.</title> 5). A curious ceremony was performed at these Capitoline games, from their supposed connection with a triumph of Romulus over Veii; or, as Mommsen holds, with the capture of Veii by Camillus in B.C. 396. An old man, who was considered to represent the king of Veii, was led through the Forum to the Capitol, dressed in regal attire and wearing a <seg lang="la">bulla</seg> suspended from his neck; and a herald accompanying him proclaimed the “sale of the Sardians,” because the Veientines, being Etruscans, were supposed to have come from Sardis, in Lydia ( <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 53, p. 227).

 <p>(17) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Palatīni</hi>. Theatrical exhibitions held on the 21st, 22d, and 23d of each January in a private theatre and before a specially invited audience, in honour of the divinity of Augustus (Dio Cass. lvi. 46; lix. 16;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 73</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(18) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Plebeii</hi>. Games held in the Circus Flaminius, and mentioned as early as B.C. 216 (<bibl n="Liv.  23. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiii. 30</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  17" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 17</bibl>). Now, as the Circus Flaminius was built in B.C. 220 (Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 20." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>xx.</bibl>), we may assign the establishment of the Ludi Plebeii to the same date, and also the <title>Iovis epulum</title> on the Ides (for all Ides were sacred to Iupiter) which is connected with these games (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 2</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  10" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 10</bibl>; xxvii. 3<bibl n="Liv.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 9</bibl>). We find from the Calendar of Philocalus (A.D. 354) that the Ludi Plebeii lasted till the fourth century. The date of them was originally <bibl n="Nov.  15" default="NO" valid="yes">Nov.15</bibl>, just as that of the Ludi Romani was <bibl n="Sept.  15" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.15</bibl> (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. 401). They were celebrated by the plebeian aediles; and already in B.C. 207 they lasted for more than one day (<bibl n="Liv.  28. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxviii. 10</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 7</bibl>). In some early calendars—e. g. the Fasti Maffeiani—they are put down as lasting from <bibl n="Nov.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Nov.4</bibl> to <bibl n="Nov.  17." default="NO" valid="yes">Nov.17.</bibl>Dramatic performances formed a part of these games, as is seen from the didascalia to the <title>Stichus</title> of Plautus.
 </p>
 <p>(19) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Pontificāles</hi>. The same as the Ludi Actiaci. See above, p. 973.</p>
 <p>(20) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Romāni</hi>. Games held in honour of Iupiter, and said to have been established by Tarquinius Priscus on the occasion of his conquest of the Latin Apiolae (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 35</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 9</bibl>); though Dionysius and Cicero refer their establishment to the victory over the Latins at Lake Regillus. At first they lasted for one day only; a second day was added on the expulsion of the kings in B.C. 509; a third after the first secession, B.C. 494. From the year 191 to 171 they lasted ten days (<bibl n="Liv.  36. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxvi. 2</bibl>; xxxix. 22<bibl n="Liv.  1" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 1</bibl>), and shortly before Caesar's death they appear to have been a fifteenday festival—from <bibl n="Sept.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.5</bibl> to 19. After Caesar's death a day was added: this day must have been <bibl n="Sept.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.4</bibl>; and so it appears in the calendars of the Augustan period, the days of the games being <bibl n="Sept.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.4</bibl> to 19. There was the <title>epulum Iovis</title> on the 13th, and the <seg lang="la">equorum probatio</seg> on the 14th. The games in the Circus lasted from the 15th to the 19th. In the Calendar of Philocalus (A.D. 354) they run from <bibl n="Sept.  12" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.12</bibl> to 15. The celebration was in the hands, at first, of the consuls; afterwards of the curule aediles.</p>
 <p>We must not suppose that these games were regularly established as annual from the beginning. Games, as already stated, in many cases began from a vow made by the commander, and were celebrated as a special festival after his triumphal procession. As the army, however, used to go forth, as a general rule, each summer, it became customary, when it returned in autumn, to celebrate such games, though connected with no triumph, and though no signal victory had been gained. But still, in all cases, they were celebrated as extraordinary games, and not as games regularly established by law. They were <hi rend="italic">sollemnes</hi>, “customary,” but had not yet become <title>annui. Ludi magni</title> is the term applied to extraordinary games originating in a vow (<seg lang="la">ludi votivi</seg>), while <title>ludi Romani</title> is that applied to the games when they were regularly established as annual (<seg lang="la">ludi stati</seg>). The latter term—i. e. <title>ludi Romani</title>—is first used by Livy in viii. 40<bibl n="Liv.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 2</bibl>(see Weissenborn <seg lang="la">ad loc.</seg>); and after that <cb /> the terms varied according as the games are <seg lang="la">stati</seg> (e. g. x. 47, 7; xxv. 2, 8) or <seg lang="la">votivi</seg> (xxii. 9, 10; 10, 7; xxvii. 33, 8; xxxvi. 2, 2; xxxix. 22, 2, etc.;  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>23</bibl>). The final establishment of these games must lie between B.C. 367 and B.C. 322; and the year B.C. 367, when so many changes were effected, and when we are told a day was added to these games and curule aediles appointed to superintend them, seems most reasonable to assume.</p>
 <p>The actual Ludi Romani consisted of, first a solemn procession (<seg lang="la">pompa</seg>); then a chariot-race, in which each chariot, in Homeric fashion, carried a driver and a warrior, the latter, at the end of the race, leaping out and running on foot ( <bibl n="Dionys.  7. 72" default="NO">Dionys.vii. 72</bibl>). This was a practice confined to the Ludi Romani. In the exhibitions of riding, each rider had a second horse led by the hand, as it appears the Roman horsemen, in early times, were in the habit of using two horses in battle (cf. Gran. Licinian. bk. xxvi.), like the Tarentini in Greek warfare (<bibl n="Liv.  35. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxv. 28</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 8</bibl>). Such riders were called <seg lang="la">desultores</seg> (<bibl n="Liv.  23. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 5</bibl>). Originally, in all probability, there was only one contest of each kind, and only two competitors in each contest, as “may be inferred from the circumstance that, at all periods in the Roman chariot-race, only as many chariots competed as there were so-called factions; and of these there were originally only two—the white and the red” (Mommsen, <title>R. H.</title> i. 301, note). These few events allowed further minor exhibitions, such as boxers, dancers, competition in youthful horsemanship (<title>ludus Troiae</title>), etc. It was allowed that the wreath the victor won should be put on his bier when dead (Twelve Tables, 10, 7). During the festival, too, the successful warrior in real warfare wore the spoils he had won from the enemy, and was crowned with a chaplet. After the introduction of the drama in B.C. 364, plays were acted at the Ludi Romani. In B.C. 161 the <title>Phormio</title> of Terence was given at these games. See Mommsen, <title>Römische Forschungen</title>, ii. 42-57.</p>
 <p>(21) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Saeculāres</hi>. Games originally known as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ludi Terentīni</hi>. <title>Terentum</title> (from <seg lang="la">terere</seg>) was a volcanic cleft in the Campus Martius, at which even under the monarchy the Valerian gens sacrificed dark victims to Dis and Proserpina. Valerius Maximus (ii. 5, 2) tells a story of a certain Valesius who got his sons cured of a serious illness by giving them water from the Tiber boiled over this cleft; and these sons saw in the sleep that restored them to health a vision which ordered the sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to Dis and Proserpina on an altar to be found in the Terentum, and the celebration of <seg lang="la">lectisternia</seg> and nocturnal games for three nights in their honour. The altar was found deep buried, the sacrifice was offered, and from this sacrifice date the Ludi Terentini. We are told that P. Valerius Poplicola, first consul, in a case of pestilence offered the same sacrifice and held the same games, and thereby saved the State (Val. Max. l. c.). But this latter is a very old mistake, due to the confusion of the first consul with the L. Valerius Poplicola, consul in B.C. 449; for though we cannot be certain of any celebration of these games in B.C. 349, we have the most distinct evidence for their being held in B.C. 249 (cf. Varro <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Censor. <title>De Die Natali</title>, 17, 18). The next celebration was not in B.C. 149, but in 146 (Censor. <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> 17, 11, who quotes contemporary authorities, Piso, Gellius, and Hemina). In the year 
<pb n="975" /><cb /> B.C. 49 religion was silent amid the turmoil of the Civil War, and the games were not solemnized till the well-known celebration of Augustus in B.C. 17. But why in that year?</p>
 <p>There were many Greek myths (Lobeck, <title>Aglaoph.</title> 791 foll.) of certain ages of the world—the Golden Age, the Silver Age, etc.—mixed up with astronomical theories of the whole order of the universe beginning anew when the planets returned to their original positions after what was called the <seg lang="la">magnus annus.</seg> The same series of people would reappear on earth and repeat again the various exploits of their lives (cf.  <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 4. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>iv. 34</bibl> foll.). Among these myths was one that the cycle began anew after four periods of 110 years each (cf. Probus <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Verg. l. c.; and Varro <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> St. August., <title>De Civ. Dei</title>, xxii. 28). Again, there was an influence from Etruria. Just as at Rome at the end of every five years there was a propitiatory offering made to the gods for the people, so in Etruria a similar sacrifice was made at the beginning of what they considered a <seg lang="la">saeculum</seg>—i. e. that space of time which embraced even the longest life. The propitiatory offering was made for all alive at the time: when that whole race had passed away, the gods signified that the cycle was over by sending prodigies, and a new sacrifice had to be offered (Censor. <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> 17, 5). The first four <seg lang="la">saecula</seg> of the Etruscans lasted 100 years each, the fifth 123, the sixth and seventh 119 (Varro <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Censor. l. c.): so that something over 100 years was the average <seg lang="la">saeculum.</seg> The definite Greek theory that the <seg lang="la">saeculum</seg> lasted 110 years was taken up by the Quindecimviri ( <title>Carm. Saec.</title> 21), and in the interest of Augustus they proceeded to invent celebrations for B.C. 456, 346, 236, 126, Augustus's games being celebrated in the last year of the <seg lang="la">saeculum</seg>, B.C. 17.</p>
 <p>The successors of Augustus celebrated the secular games according to different kinds of computation. Claudius, says Gibbon, did not treat the oracle with implicit respect. He celebrated the games, “which none had ever seen before,” in the eight hundredth year of the city (A.D. 47), with an actor who had taken part in the secular games of Augustus (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.  159" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 159</bibl>). Domitian celebrated them in A.D. 87, six years too early if they were to be 110 years after those of Augustus. (See Suet. <title>Domit.</title> 4;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 11. 11." default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xi. 11.</bibl>) Antoninus Pius in the year 900 of the city (A.D. 147) celebrated them (Aurel. Vict. <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 15" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>15</bibl><bibl n="Jul. Caes. 4" default="NO"> Caes., 4</bibl>), while Severus held them 220 years after Augustus, in A.D. 204. The last celebration was in the thousandth year of the city (A.D. 247) by the emperor Philip (Eutrop. 9, 3; Eckhel, vii. 323, 324). It may be that Gallienus in A.D. 257 (Eckhel, vii. 409; viii. 22) held them as an extraordinary solemnity in a period of great trouble (Trebell. Pollio, <bibl n="App. Gall. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Gall.</title>5</bibl>), and Maximian, in A.D. 304, certainly intended to hold them, but does not appear to have carried out his intention: so from Philip's time we may say that the secular games disappear till they were revived in the Middle Ages as the Papal Jubilees instituted by Pope Boniface VIII. in the year 1300 (Gibbon, i. 327, 328; viii. 217, ed. Smith).</p>
 <p>The Ludi Terentini, then, and their continuation, the Ludi Saeculares, are not a really genuine Roman ceremony. They rest on reference to the Sibylline Books ( <title>Carm. Saec.</title> 5), are celebrated by the Quindecimviri outside the Pomoerium (that the gods of the lower world might not be brought inside the city), the gods honoured are not Roman, <cb /> and the Roman antiquarians considered the solemnities to be derived from Etruria (Censor. <hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi>).</p>
 <p>The rites of the celebration are given by Zosimus (ii. 5), who also quotes <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> the Sibylline oracle ordering the celebration. His account is as follows: Heralds summoned the people to the spectacle they had never seen before and never would see again. Then in the Capitoline temple of Iupiter and the Palatine temple of Apollo, the Quindecimviri gave to all present (slaves excluded) purificatories (<foreign lang="greek">καθάρσια</foreign>, <seg lang="la">suffimenta</seg>), consisting of torches, sulphur, and bitumen; and in the same temples, and that of Diana on the Aventine, wheat, barley, and beans were given to the people to make an offering with, though Zosimus says these were to be given to the actors in the games. Then began the feast, which lasted three nights and three days. Offerings were made to Iupiter, Iuno Lucina, Apollo, Latona and Diana, the Fates, Demeter (<title>Tellus</title>, <title>Carm. Saec.</title> 29), Pluto, and Proserpina. On the first night, at the second hour, the emperor, with the assistance of the Quindecimviri, sacrificed to the Fates, at the Terentum, on the border of the Tiber, three rams on three altars, letting the blood flow all over the altars, and then thoroughly burned the victims. A stage was then erected, the people lighted torches, a newly-composed hymn was sung, and splendid shows exhibited: for the oracle had said that the grave was to be mingled with the gay. On the next day a sacrifice was made on the Capitol of white bulls to Iupiter and a white cow to Iuno, in accordance with the oracle, and then in the theatre there were dramatic representations in honour of Apollo. On the second night a white pig and a white sow were sacrificed to Tellus, in accordance with the oracle, and dark victims offered to Dis and Proserpina, at an altar of which some remains were discovered in the winter of 1886-87. On the second day the matrons offered supplications and sang hymns to Iuno on the Capitol; and on the third day in the Palatine temple of Apollo there was a sacrifice of white oxen, and thrice nine noble boys and maidens whose parents were still alive (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιθαλεῖς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">patrimi ac matrimi</seg>) sang hymns in Greek and Latin for the preservation and prosperity of the Roman Empire. Such a hymn was called <title>Carmen Saeculare</title>, and we still possess the one which Horace wrote for the celebration of the games by Augustus.</p>
 <p>A most interesting inscription containing an official report of the Augustan pageant was discovered September 20, 1890. It was cut upon a block of marble and contained 168 lines of minute writing. The inscription has been edited by Prof. Mommsen <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1891)</bibl>, and is the subject of an excellent popular article by Prof. Lanciani in the <title>Atlantic Monthly</title> for February, 1892.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλεῖον</foreign>). A school.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. Of education in the Homeric Age one cannot affirm anything with certainty. Achilles is represented as having a sort of rhetorical training under Phoenix ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 414" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ix. 414</bibl>), and in music and the healing art under the Centaur, Chiron; and noble youths are spoken of as undergoing a course of instruction in arms and martial exercises. Cf. Plut. <title>De Educ. Liberis</title>, 12.</p>
 <p>In later times, the Ionic States of Greece paid great attention to literary as well as to physical culture. Herodotus (vi. 27) speaks of a boys' school at Chios as early as B.C. 500 with 120 pupils. A decree of the Mitylenaeans is given by Aelian (vii. 15) in which the prohibition of schools is made a punishment for disloyal allies. Diodorus (xii. 12) states that Charondas (<seg lang="la">circa</seg> B.C. 550) passed a law for Thurii giving to all boys a literary training at the public cost. (See Polyb. xxxi. 17; Hirschfeld in <title>Hermes</title>, ix. 501; and Plato, <title>Crit.</title> 50 D.) The Spartans, on the other hand, and in fact the Dorians in general, paid much more attention to physical than to mental training, and any literary education was given to a boy at the expense of his parents and not by the State. Cf. Plato, <title>Hipp. Maior</title>, p. 285 C; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossbidiaei">Bidiaei</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosseducation">Education</ref>; Paedonomi.</p>
 <p>For the purposes of the present article we may take the schools of Athens as representing the higher development of secondary education in ancient Greece. There is no positive evidence that at Athens the State exercised any direct control over the schools, though a law of Solon required parents and guardians to provide boys with a suitable education (Plato, <title>Crit.</title> 50 D). There were no girls' schools at Athens, but such training as the daughters of a family received was from their mothers, and consisted chiefly of the domestic arts of sewing, spinning, etc.</p>
 <p><title>School Period.</title>—From the age of six, a boy was intrusted to a <seg lang="la">paedagogus</seg> (q. v.), who conducted him everywhere—to school, to the palaestra, etc. —carrying his books, tablets, and other school requisites. This is explained by Plato, who says that, if animals have care-takers, of course the boy must, “being the most unmanageable of all animals” (<title>De Leg.</title> vii. 808 D). The school began early in the morning, and ended at sunset, according to Solon's law, but there was an interval for luncheon at mid-day. In grammar-schools the Musea was <cb /> a school festival, and there were holidays at great festivals, so much so that in the month Anthesterion there was comparatively little time for school (Theophr. 22).</p>
 <p><title>Subjects of Study.</title>—The regular school course (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία</foreign>) was intended to convey, besides mere reading and writing, a knowledge of the poets, and proficiency in music and gymnastics. In the time of Socrates some mathematical training was added, and at least a knowledge of simple arithmetic was universally imparted. This mere reckoning, however, was taught mainly at home by means of a calculating-table (see <ref type="cross" target="crossabacus">Abacus</ref>; Mathematica); and accordingly Aristotle ( <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>v.</bibl> or viii. 1) speaks of three usual subjects, <foreign lang="greek">γράμματα, γυμναστική</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">μουσική</foreign>, the last including <foreign lang="greek">γράμματα</foreign>. The elementary reading-lesson was sometimes made easy and attractive by methods like those of the modern kindergarten, the use of ivory letters, etc. (Cf. Plato, <title>De Leg.</title> vii. 819 D.) Grasberger cites from Philostratus (<title>Vit. Soph.</title> ii. p. 240) a device of Herodes, who gives to a dull pupil twentyfour companions named from the letters of the alphabet to aid his memory.</p>
 <p>For the method of teaching writing, see Plato, <title>Protag.</title> 326 D. The literary course consisted of reading and explaining the best poets, such as Homer, Hesiod, Theognis, Phocyllides; but more especially Homer. In  <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 3. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>iii. 5</bibl>, Niceratus says, “My father, to make me a good man, compelled me to learn all the poems of Homer, and now I could say by heart the whole <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title>” This poetical training was intended to impart a knowledge of mythology and philosophy (especially through the maxims), as well as taste and power of expression. Of course time was less occupied than now, since there was no language, natural science, or history to be learned.</p>
 <p>To this literary course was sometimes added special teaching in tactics and strategy for those who looked to a military career; and drawing was taught before the time of Aristotle, having been, according to Pliny , introduced by Pamphilus (the teacher of Apelles), first at Sicyon, whence it spread over Greece, and was regarded for all sons of citizens a most important branch of education— slaves might not learn it (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  77" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 77</bibl>). It was chiefly correct outline drawing without colour, on boxwood tablets. The musical teaching began at twelve or thirteen, and was so managed that the pupils might appreciate and accompany lyric poetry. It should be observed that the instrument taught was the lyre: the flute, a favourite instrument at Thebes, and once commonly learned at Athens, was tabooed, except for professionals, about the time of the Peloponnesian War. The <foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλεῖα</foreign> lasted till <foreign lang="greek">ἥβη</foreign>—i. e. till sixteen; and afterwards for those of the richer classes, who wished for advanced learning, came the schools of the rhetoricians and sophists, who taught various departments of knowledge.</p>
 <p><title>Place of Education.</title>—The school-room itself was called <foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλεῖον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">παιδαγωγεῖον</foreign>; also <foreign lang="greek">φωλεόν</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">φωλεός</foreign>. Some, indeed, maintain that the <foreign lang="greek">παιδαγωγεῖον</foreign> was only an ante-room, where the paedagogi sat and waited; but Grasberger (vol. ii. 207) remarks that it was unlikely that so poor a school as that of Elpias would have an ante-room, and cites Philostratus (<title>Vit. Soph.</title> ii. 263) to show that the paedagogi sat with their charges. In Roman times certainly we have Remmius Palaemon, as paedagogus, 
<pb n="977" /><cb /><figure id="fig.00977">
<head orig="Athenian School. (From the Vase.)">Athenian School. (From the Vase.)</head>
</figure> learning more than the schoolboys from the lesson ( <title>Gr.</title> 23). Some schools had not even one room, but were held in the open air, as by Dionysius the Younger ( <bibl n="Gel.  21. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xxi. 5</bibl>). This, however, is only in the case of the very poor; even the father of Aeschines is described by Demosthenes as in a school-room, and Demosthenes contrasts that establishment with the respectable (<foreign lang="greek">προσήκοντα</foreign>) schools to which he went himself. The boys sat on benches (<foreign lang="greek">βάθρα</foreign>), the master on a chair (<foreign lang="greek">θρόνος</foreign>). See the rather unattractive picture in Libanius (iv. p. 868), where we are told that the master “sits aloft, like a dicast, with an awful frown and an expression of implacable wrath, before which the pupil must tremble and cringe.” In the vase-picture given above we see the various departments, each group representing a class: (1) repetition of poetry;</p>
 <p>(2) music lesson on the lyre (where both teacher and pupil sit, and both have laid aside the <hi rend="italic">himation</hi> to give free play to the arms);</p>
 <p>(3) the writing-master with a tablet (or possibly a master correcting an exercise);</p>
 <p>(4) a singing-lesson, where the master is not teaching the forbidden flute (see above), but giving a note from it. On the walls are articles of the school apparatus—book-roll, tablets, lyre, geometrical instrument (?), drinking-vessel, basket for books. It is a disputed question whether the seated spectators are government inspectors, paedagogi, or parents, and the question is so impossible to decide that the picture unfortunately cannot be made an argument for the presence of any one of the three at the lesson.</p>
 <p><title>School-fees.</title>—The poor status of the Athenian school-master (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματιστής</foreign>) is sufficiently established. He was ill-paid, and often did not receive his payment at all. This does not apply to the sophists in the more advanced schools, who were able to charge as much as 100 minae ($1800) for their complete course to each pupil; and the chairs founded in later times by Hadrian had a stipend of 100 minae a year attached to them. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseducation">Education</ref>, p. 572.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>. At Rome, education, though not made obligatory by any law, was always considered important. In early days, however, the father himself generally taught his son (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 8. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>Ep.</title>viii. 14</bibl>; cf. Plaut. <title>Most.</title> i. 2, 42). So Servius Tullius <cb /> is said to have been taught by King Tarquin; and of Cato the Elder it is said, as part of his conservatism, that he taught and trained his own son ( <title>Cat. Mai.</title> 20). This old training no doubt consisted much in living with the father and learning his business of public life; but there was also direct instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic (i. e. reckoning), and in saying by heart the Twelve <ref type="cross" target="crosstables">Tables</ref> (q.v.), which formed a sort of catechism to the Roman of the old school. But it of course often happened that the father lacked either the ability or the inclination to teach his son, and so arose the custom of wealthy parents employing educated slaves or freedmen as private tutors at home. Livius Andronicus, late in the third century B.C., was so employed by Livius Salinator; Augustus so employed the freedman Verrius Flaccus to teach his grandsons; and in some cases, when the teacher was a slave, his master let him teach a class of outsiders and so made a profit ( <title>Cat. Mai.</title> 20). It is probable, however, that even in the earliest times there were schools to which those who could neither teach themselves, nor provide competent slaves as teachers, sent their children, boys and girls alike. Plutarch ( <bibl n="Plut. Rom. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Rom.</title>6</bibl>) represents Romulus and Remus as learning at a school at Gabii; and, in less purely legendary times, there is no reason to discredit the account of Virginia going to school (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 44</bibl>), or of the schools at Falerii (<bibl n="Liv.  5. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 44</bibl>) and Tusculum (<bibl n="Liv.  6. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vi. 25</bibl>) early in the fourth century B.C.</p>
 <p>Against this has been adduced by some the passage of Plutarch (<title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 59), which states that Spurius Carvilius was the first person who opened a school (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματοδιδασκαλεῖον</foreign>) at Rome, B.C. 231; but Plutarch probably only means that Carvilius was the first <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg> or teacher of the more advanced literary schools, which came in along with the influence of Greek literature, and he does not thereby negative the elementary schools mentioned by Livy (and indeed by himself elsewhere) as existing much earlier. It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish (1) <seg lang="la">litterator</seg>, or <seg lang="la">magister litterarius</seg> (=<foreign lang="greek">γραμματιστής</foreign>), the elementary school-master;</p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg> (also <seg lang="la">litteratus</seg>), a more advanced teacher;</p>
 <p>(3) <seg lang="la">rhetor</seg> ( <title>Flor.</title> 20). Private teachers were employed in later as in older times by many men of high station; but still, except the imperial family, it was common for those of the highest rank to send their sons to schools. Thus we find Sulla sending his son Faustus to the school in which Cassius also was being educated; and Ausonius, a man of the highest rank in the State, recommends school education in a passage cited below. The question whether home or school education is to be preferred is discussed by Quintilian (<title>Inst. Or.</title> i. 2), with a result in favour of the latter, and the arguments on either side have a striking resemblance to those which are used at the present day.</p>
 <p><title>Place.</title>—The elementary schools and those of the <seg lang="la">grammatici</seg> were usually in a veranda partly open to the street, and the school-room is accordingly called <seg lang="la">pergula, taberna</seg>, or <seg lang="la">porticus</seg> ( <title>Gr.</title> 18; <bibl n="Juv.  11. 137" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xi. 137</bibl>; <bibl n="Liv.  3. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 44</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  6. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vi. 25</bibl>; Eumen. <title>Pro Inst. Schol.</title> 20). Hence the noise of teaching and of punishing was audible through the street and annoying to the neighbours ( <bibl n="Mart.  12. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xii. 57</bibl>). Boys and girls were taught in the same school, as is shown alike by passages such as <bibl n="Mart.  8. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  9.68" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., ix. 68</bibl>; 
<pb n="978" /><cb /> Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> ii. 369, and by old paintings which have been discovered.</p>
 <p><title>School-hours.</title>—The school began early, even before dawn ( <bibl n="Mart.  9. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.ix. 68</bibl>); so that the boys brought lamps with them ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 226" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 226</bibl>). There was a break for the prandium, after which the school was continued. Each boy was accompanied from his home by his paedagogus, or slave, who acted as a sort of private tutor both in regard to control and not unfrequently in teaching, also called <seg lang="la">custos</seg>, and by an inferior slave called <seg lang="la">capsarius</seg>, carrying the books and tablets. Juvenal (vii. 222 foll.) describes for us the school-room; the busts of the poets blackened by smoke from the scholars' lamps, the master seated on his chair (<seg lang="la">cathedra</seg>), while his class stood before him or sat on benches (<seg lang="la">subsellia</seg>). We hear also of wall-maps in a remarkable passage of Eumenius, a teacher at Autun at the end of the third century: “The boys should have daily before their eyes on the walls all lands and seas, all cities and peoples, comprehended under our Empire; for the name and position of places, the distances between them, the source and outflow of rivers, the coast-line with all its sea-board, its gulfs and its straits, are better taken in by the eye than by the ear” (<title>Pro Inst. Schol.</title> 20; cf. Propert. v. 3, 37). There were also tables of authors and of dates hung up (see Marquardt, <title>Privatleben</title>, 109).</p>
 <p><title>Discipline.</title>—That this was generally severe may be seen from the line of Juvenal (i. 15), <seg lang="la">et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus</seg>, and from the abundant illustrations given by Professor Mayor on that passage. Zonaras mentions that the prince Arcadius was flogged by Arsenius without apparently any objection from the emperor Theodosius. Arsenius, however, seems to have been a private tutor, teaching only the emperor's children. Quintilian (i. 3, 14) argues against corporal punishment altogether. On the other hand, prizes were given to encourage the industrious—some valuable or prettily got-up book ( <title>Gr.</title> 17). Prizes are mentioned also at Athens in the Roman period for the best <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμιον</foreign> or essay. Few passages will <figure id="fig.00978">
<head orig="School Flogging.">School Flogging.</head>
</figure> better give an idea of a Roman school than the idyl (iv.) which Ausonius (once tutor to Valentinian's sons, but afterwards a count of the Empire and consul) addresses to his grandson, just going to school.</p>
 <p><title>School-time and Holidays.</title>—The Roman school year began on March 24, after the Quinquatria, when the new boy brought his entrance-fee (<title>Minerval</title>). Sometimes the money for the whole previous <cb /> year was brought then ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 242" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 242</bibl>), but (as appears from  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 6" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 72" default="NO"> Sat., 72</bibl>) it was usually paid each month; and this is prescribed by an edict of Diocletian (<title>C. I. L.</title> iii. 831). The regular holidays or vacation were the week at the Saturnalia in December and the five days at the Quinquatria in March, but there was also a holiday on each of the <seg lang="la">nundinae</seg> ( <title>Gr.</title> 7), and at the time of the important games.</p>
 <p><title>Subjects of Study.</title>—The school life began usually at seven years of age ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  15" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 15</bibl>); but no doubt in most cases there was some earlier home instruction. Tacitus ( <bibl n="Sen. Dial. 29" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Dial.</title>29</bibl>) mentions, with no approval, the custom of having a Greek maid, like a <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi>, for children to give them an early familiarity with the Greek language. In the elementary schools the course consisted of reading, writing, and simple arithmetic. Quintilian mentions the system of making the reading-lesson attractive by using ivory letters, as mentioned above in Greek schools. The writing-lesson was on a wax tablet, with lines or furrows (<seg lang="la">sulci</seg>) to guide the hand ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  27" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 27</bibl>). Arithmetic was of great importance in the Roman judgment, and we find from an edict of Diocletian that the arithmetic master (<seg lang="la">calculator</seg>) was paid more highly than the teacher of reading and writing. In the schools of the grammarians came the study of poets. This school differed from the elementary school, because that was training merely for the bare necessities of practical life, while the grammar school (if we may so term it) was nearer the ideal Greek training, an <seg lang="la">eruditio liberalis</seg> or “liberal education” ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 2. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Tusc.</title>ii. 11</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Tusc., 27</bibl>). The central point was to read with full explanation Greek and Latin poets; the boy must first learn to read the poet with understanding and with correct emphasis. It is clear that the Romans, like the Greeks, laid the greatest stress on elocution, for eloquence under the Republic was the only avenue to power ( <bibl n="Tac. Dial. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Dial.</title>37</bibl>), and the school was intended to train the utterance as well as to supply a flow of words.</p>
 <p>With this object the master read over the passage and made the class repeat it (<seg lang="la">reddere dictata</seg>); expressed also by the word <seg lang="la">praelegere</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  1. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 36</bibl>; <bibl n="Quint.  1. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 8</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 8</bibl>). Besides this, however, the passage was thoroughly threshed out as to its meaning, its metre, and the questions of geography, history, mythology, and ethics connected with it ( <bibl n="Quint.  1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 4</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 4</bibl>; <title>Verr.</title> i. 18, 47;  <bibl n="Tac. Dial. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Dial.</title>30</bibl>). The questions raised were, however, often extremely trivial, “the name of Anchises' nurse,” etc. ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 235" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 235</bibl>, with Mayor's note). There were also learning by heart and practice in verse composition: prose belonged to the rhetorical school, when that was established as separate from the grammatical. As regards the authors read, Homer universally held the first place ( <title>Epist.</title> ii. 2, 42; <bibl n="Quint.  1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 5</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 8</bibl>; Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> ii. 14), and next, perhaps, the favourite was Menander (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> ii. 23), and then the great tragedians. We have an account of the books read in the school kept by the father of Statius at Naples, and the list comprises Homer, Hesiod, Theocritus, Pindar, Ibycus, Stesichorus, Sappho, Corinna, Callimachus. It is possible, as Friedländer remarks, that at Naples, as a town preserving Greek life and habits, Greek literature might be more deeply studied than elsewhere. The Latin authors most read in the first century were Vergil, Horace, and Lucan. A reaction took place 
<pb n="979" /><cb />
 as to the literature in vogue about A.D. 100, and, in place of the authors of the Augustan Age, the older prose writers and the poets of the third century B.C. —Gracchus, Naevius, Ennius, Plautus, Attius, and Lucilius—were adopted as school-books. This was at the time when Hadrian preferred Cato to Cicero, Ennius to Vergil. Fronto, the teacher of Marcus Aurelius, was a leader in the depreciation of the Augustan writers. Music began to be studied towards the end of the first century—a mark of Greek influence ( <title>Epist.</title> 88, 9;  <bibl n="Suet. Tit. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tit.</title>3</bibl>); and the above course, with the addition of geometry, formed what Quintilian calls the <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία</foreign>, with which the majority were content. Many, however, proceeded to the school of the <seg lang="la">rhetor.</seg> Like the school of the <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg>, this was originally formed after the Greek pattern. The early Latin rhetors, Plotius, etc., were not approved, and the censors in B.C. 92 closed the Latin schools of rhetoric, because, as they alleged, they were a pretence for idleness ( <bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Rhet.</title>1</bibl>). In these schools prose authors took the place of poets; but the principal part was the prose exercise, which, for the beginner a mere prose narrative, passed on to the <seg lang="la">declamatio.</seg> The easier kind of <seg lang="la">declamatio</seg> was <seg lang="la">suasoria</seg>, on some historical and mythological subject, adopting some view on this or that story or point of history and arguing it. They advanced to <seg lang="la">controversiae</seg> or declamations on some legal point.</p>
 <p>The status and emoluments of the school-masters, <seg lang="la">grammatistae</seg> and <seg lang="la">grammatici</seg> alike, were low. What their ordinary fee was, cannot, however, be determined. In Diocletian's time (when their position was probably better than when Juvenal wrote), the maximum fee for the <hi rend="italic">grammatistes</hi> from each pupil was 50 denarii a month, and for the <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg> 200 (<title>C. I. L.</title> iii. 831). The <seg lang="la">rhetor</seg> seems to have received twice as much as the <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg>, and his emoluments were increased by the State endowments begun by Vespasian ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 18" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>18</bibl>). Remmius Palaemon is cited as an instance of a wealthy <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg>, and by a <seg lang="la">rhetor</seg> wealth was more often acquired. There were, besides, the turns of fortune, of which Juvenal speaks (vii. 197, with Mayor's note), and of which the emperor Pertinax (once a <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg>) and Ausonius afford instances.</p>

 <p> (1) A city of Gaul, situated near the confluence of the Rhodanus (Rhône) and the Arar (Saône) (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 4. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iv. 18</bibl>). It was one of the places conquered by Caesar, and, a short time after his death, Munatius Plancus received orders from the Roman Senate to re-assemble at Lugdunum the inhabitants of Vienna (Vienne), who had been driven out of their city by the Allobroges (Dio Cass. xlvi. 50). In a little while it became very powerful, so that Strabo says it was not inferior to Narbo (Narbonne) in the number of its inhabitants. The ancient city did not occupy exactly the same spot as the modern one, but lay on the west side <cb /> of the Rhône and Saône, while the chief part of Lyons is on the east side, at the very confluence of the two streams. At the extremity of the point of land formed by the two streams, and, of course, precisely corresponding with the southern extremity of the modern city, stood the famous altar erected by sixty Gallic nations in honour of Augustus (Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 137" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>137</bibl>). At Lugdunum was established the gold and silver coinage of the province, and from this city, as a centre, the main roads diverged to all parts of Gaul. Here, too, was an immense aqueduct, remains of which still exist. The Palais des Arts of the modern city contains many specimens of Roman bronzes and other antiques found in the vicinity. The city was the seat of Irenaeus when bishop, and had witnessed severe persecutions of the Christians. In the third century it declined in importance, on account of the vicinity and rapid growth of Arelaté and Narbo. Lugdunum is said by Strabo to have been situate at the foot of a hill. In Keltic, <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> signifies “a hill,” and from this comes the Latin termination <hi rend="italic">dunum.</hi> The earlier name is said by Dio Cassius (<hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi>) to have been Lugudunum (<foreign lang="greek">Λουγούδουνον</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(2) A city of the Batavi, in Germania Inferior, now Leyden. The modern name is said to be derived from that of Leithis, which it took in the Middle Ages. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbatavi">Batavi</ref>.)</p>

 <p> A festival held in Rome from time immemorial on February 15. It was in honour of Faunus, who was worshipped under the name Lupercus 
<pb n="980" /><cb /> in the Lupercal, a grotto in the Palatine Mount. His wife <ref type="cross" target="crossluperca">Luperca</ref> or <ref type="cross" target="crosslupa">Lupa</ref> was sometimes identified with Acca Larentia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacca-larentia">Acca Larentia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>.) The object of the festival was, by expiation and purification, to give new life and fruitfulness to fields, flocks, and people. The cult was originally administered by two confraternities, which were chosen from the members of the Fabian and Quintilian families, and were named in consequence Luperci Fabiani and Luperci Quintiliani. To these was added in B.C. 44 that of the Luperci Iulii in honour of Caesar. In consequence of the Civil Wars the cult fell into desuetude, but was renewed by Augustus. In imperial times the members of these <seg lang="la">collegia</seg> were commonly of equestrian standing, and retained the name of Luperci even after leaving the body. The festival was observed until A.D. 494, in which year Bishop Gelasius I. changed it into the Feast of the Purification. See Fleury, <title>Hist. Ecclés.</title> xxx. 41.</p>
 <p>The procedure at the Lupercalia was as follows: After the Flamen Dialis had sacrificed some hegoats and a dog, two youths were touched on the forehead with a knife, smeared with the blood of the goats. It was then immediately wiped off with wool dipped in milk, whereupon they were bound to laugh. After the sacrificial feast the Luperci, crowned and anointed, and naked, except for an apron of goat-skin, ran round the ancient city on the Palatine with thongs cut from the skin of the sacrificed goats in their hands. On their course, women used to place themselves in their way to receive blows from the thongs, which was believed to be a charm against barrenness. (See Mannhardt, <title>Mythologische Forschungen</title>, pp. 113 foll.) The thongs were called <seg lang="la">februa</seg>, from the old word <seg lang="la">februare</seg>, “to purify”; the day, <seg lang="la">dies februatus</seg>, “the day of purification”; and the whole month, <title>Februarius</title>, “the month of purification.” For the possible connection with totem-worship, see A. Lang, <title>Myth, Ritual, and Religion</title>, ii. 177 and 213.

The god, however, threw the table over and killed Lycaon and his sons with lightning, with the exception of Nyctimus, the youngest, whom Gaea saved by firmly holding the right hand of Zeus.

<head orig="Lycia">Lycia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυκία</foreign>). A small district on the south side of Asia Minor, between Caria and Pamphylia. According to tradition, the most ancient name of the country was Milyas, and the earliest inhabitants were called Milyae, and afterwards Solymi; subsequently the Termilae, from Crete, settled in the country; and lastly, the Athenian Lycus, the son of Pandion, fled from his brother Aegeus to Lycia, and gave his name to the country. Homer, who gives Lycia a prominent place in the <title>Iliad</title>, represents its chieftains, Glaucus and Sarpedon, as descended from the royal family of Argos (Aeolids). He speaks of the Solymi as a warlike race, inhabiting the mountains, against whom the Greek hero Bellerophontes is sent to fight by his relative the king of Lycia. Besides the legend of Bellerophon and the Chimaera, Lycia is the scene of another popular Greek story, that of the Harpies and the daughters of Pandareos; and memorials of both are preserved on the Lycian monuments now in the British Museum. On the whole, it is clear that Lycia was colonized by the Greeks at a very early period, and that its historical inhabitants were Greeks, though with a mixture of native blood. The earlier names were preserved in the district in the north of the country called Milyas, and in the mountains called Solyma. The Lycians always kept the reputation they have in Homer as brave warriors. They and the Cilicians were the only people west of the Halys whom Croesus did not conquer, and they were the last who resisted the Persians. The principal rivers are the Xanthus (Echen-Chai) and the Limyrus. The principal cities were Xanthus, Patara, Pinara, Olympus, Mira, and Tlos. Since 1840 much has been done in the 
<pb n="982" /><cb />
 way of exploration and excavation among the ruined cities of Lycia, especially by Sir Charles Fellows, who in 1846 brought back the remarkable sculptures now in the Lycian Room at the British Museum. The linguistic affinities of the Lycian language are as yet not certainly determined. See Savelsberg, <bibl default="NO"><title>Beiträge zur Erklärung der lykischen Sprache</title> (1875-78)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυκομήδης</foreign>). A king of Scyros, an island in the Aegean Sea, son of Apollo and Parthenopé. He was secretly intrusted with the care of young Achilles, whom his mother Thetis had disguised in feminine attire to prevent his going to the Trojan War, where she knew he must perish. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossachilles">Achilles</ref>.) Lycomedes rendered himself infamous for his treachery to Theseus, who had implored his protection when driven from the throne of Athens by the usurper Mnestheus. Lycomedes, as it is reported, either envious of the fame of his illustrious guest, or bribed by the emissaries of Mnestheus, led Theseus to an elevated place on pretence of showing him the extent of his dominions, and perfidiously threw him down a precipice, where he was killed. According to another account, however, his fall was accidental ( <title>Thes.;</title> Pausan. i. 17; vii. 4; <bibl n="Apollod.  3. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii. 13</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυκόφρων</foreign>). A grammarian and poet who was a native of Chalcis in Euboea, and lived at Alexandria under Ptolemy Philadelphus (B.C. 285-247). He was the author of an extant poem in 1474 iambic lines, entitled <title>Cassandra</title> or <title>Alexandra</title>, in which Cassandra is made to prophesy the fall of Troy, with numerous other events. The obscurity of this work is proverbial, and it is filled with obsolete words and long compounds. Among the numerous ancient commentaries on the poem, the most important are the scholia of Isaac and John Tzetzes, which are far more valuable than the poem itself. The earliest edition is that which appeared at Venice in 1513. It has since been edited by Bachmann <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1828)</bibl>, Kinkel <bibl default="NO">(1880)</bibl>, and Scheer <bibl default="NO">(1881)</bibl>.

<head orig="Lycurgus">Lycurgus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυκοῦργος</foreign>). (1) A king of Thrace, who, when Bacchus was passing through his country, assailed him so furiously that the god was obliged to take refuge with Thetis. Bacchus avenged himself by driving Lycurgus mad, and the latter thereupon killed his own son Dryas with a blow of an axe, taking him for a vine-branch. The land became, in consequence, sterile; and his subjects, having been informed by an oracle that it would not regain its fertility until the monarch was put to death, bound Lycurgus, and left him on Mount Pangaeus, where he was destroyed by wild horses ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.5.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.5.1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) King in Arcadia, son of Aleus and Neaera, brother of Cepheus and Augé, husband of Cleophilé, Eurynomé, or Antinoë, and father of Ancaeus, Epochus, Amphidamas, and Iasus.

 <p>(3) Son of Pronax and brother of Amphithea, the wife of Adrastus. He took part in the war of the Seven against Thebes, and fought with Amphiaraüs. He is mentioned among those whom Aesculapius called to life again after their death.</p>
 <p>(4) King of Nemea, son of Pheres and Periclymene, brother of Admetus, husband of Eurydicé or Amphithea, and father of Opheltes.
 </p>
 <p>(5) A Spartan legislator of whose personal history we have no certain information; and there are such discrepancies respecting him in the ancient writers that many modern critics have denied his real existence altogether. The more generally received account about him was as follows: Lycurgus was the son of Eunomus, king of Sparta, and brother of Polydectes. The latter succeeded his father as king of Sparta, and afterwards died, leaving his queen with child. The ambitious woman proposed to Lycurgus to destroy her offspring if he would share the throne with her. He seemingly consented; but when she had given birth to a son (Charilaüs), he openly proclaimed him king, and as next of kin acted as his guardian. But to avoid all suspicion of ambitious designs, with which the opposite party charged him, Lycurgus left Sparta, and set out on his celebrated travels, which had been magnified to a fabulous extent. He is said to have visited Crete, and there to have studied the wise laws of Minos. Next he went to Ionia and Egypt, and is reported to have penetrated into Libya, Iberia, and even India. In Ionia he is said to have met either with Homer himself, or at least with the Homeric poems, which he introduced into the mother-country. The return of Lycurgus to Sparta was hailed by all parties. Sparta was in a state of anarchy and turbulence, and he was considered as the man who alone could cure the growing diseases of the State. He undertook the task; yet before he set to work he strengthened himself with the authority of the Delphic oracle and with a strong party of influential men at Sparta. 
<pb n="983" /><cb /> The reform seems not to have been carried altogether peaceably. The new division of the land among the citizens must have violated many existing interests. But all opposition was overborne, and the whole constitution, military and civil, was remodelled. After Lycurgus had obtained for his institutions an approving oracle of the national god of Delphi, he exacted a promise from the people not to make any alterations in his laws before his return, and then he left Sparta to finish his life in voluntary exile, in order that his countrymen might be bound by their oath to preserve his constitution inviolate forever. Where and how he died nobody could tell. He vanished from the earth like a god, leaving no traces behind him but his spirit; and he was honoured as a god at Sparta with a temple and yearly sacrifices down to the latest times. The date of Lycurgus is variously given, but it is impossible to place it later than B.C. 825. Lycurgus was regarded through all subsequent ages as the legislator of Sparta, and therefore almost all the Spartan institutions were ascribed to him as their author. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssparta">Sparta</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(6) An Athenian orator, and one of the warmest supporters of the democratic faction in the contest with Philip of Macedon. The time of his birth is uncertain, but he was older than Demosthenes; and if his father was put to death by order of the Thirty Tyrants, he must have been born previous to B.C. 404. But the words of the biographer are, as Clinton has justly remarked, ambiguous (<title>Fast. Hell.</title> ii. p. 151), and may imply that it was his grandfather who was put to death by the Thirty. Lycurgus is said to have derived instruction from Plato and Isocrates. He took an active part in the management of public affairs, and was one of the Athenian ambassadors who succeeded (B.C. 343) in counteracting the designs of Philip against Ambracia and the Peloponnesus. He filled the office of treasurer of the public revenue for three periods of five years ( <bibl n="Diod.  16. 88" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xvi. 88</bibl>); and was noted for the integrity and ability with which he discharged the duties of his office. Böckh considers that Lycurgus was the only statesman of antiquity who had a real knowledge of the management of finance. He raised the revenue to twelve hundred talents, and also erected, during his administration, many public buildings, and completed the docks, the armory, the theatre of Bacchus, and the Panathenaic course. So great confidence was placed in the honesty of Lycurgus that many citizens confided to his custody large sums; and, shortly before his death, he had the accounts of his public administration engraved on stone, and set up in a part of the wrestling-school. An inscription, preserved to the present day, containing some accounts of a manager of the public revenue, is supposed by Böckh to be a part of the accounts of Lycurgus. After the battle of Chaeronea (B.C. 388), Lycurgus conducted the accusation against the Athenian general Lysicles. He was one of the orators demanded by Alexander after the destruction of Thebes (B.C. 335). He died about B.C. 323, and was buried in the Academia (Pausan. i. 29, 15). Fifteen years after his death, upon the ascendency of the democratic faction, a decree was passed by the Athenian people that public honours should be paid to Lycurgus. A brazen statue of him was erected in the Ceramicus, which was seen by Pansanias (i. 8, 3), and the representative of his family <cb /> was allowed the privilege of dining in the Prytaneum. This decree, which was proposed by Stratocles, has come down to us at the end of the lives of the Ten Orators. Lycurgus is said to have published fifteen orations, of which only one has been preserved. This oration, which was delivered B.C. 331, is an accusation of Leocrates (<foreign lang="greek">Κατὰ Λεωκράτους</foreign>), as Athenian citizen, for abandoning Athens after the battle of Chaeronea, and settling in another Grecian State. The best editions of Lycurgus are those of Osann <bibl default="NO">(Jena, 1821)</bibl>, Mätzner <bibl default="NO">(1836)</bibl>, Kiessling and Meier <bibl default="NO">(1847)</bibl>, Rehdantz <bibl default="NO">(1876)</bibl>, and Thalheim <bibl default="NO">(1880)</bibl>.

<head orig="Lydia">Lydia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυδία</foreign>). A district of Asia Minor, in the middle of the western side of the peninsula, between Mysia on the north and Caria on the south, and between Phrygia on the east and the Aegean Sea on the west. Its boundaries varied so much at different times that they cannot be described with any approach to exactness till we come to the time of the Roman rule over western Asia. At that time the northern boundary, towards Mysia, was the range of mountains which form the northern margin of the valley of the Hermus, called Sardené, a southwestern branch of the Phrygian Olympus; the eastern boundary, towards Phrygia, was an imaginary line; and the southern boundary, towards Caria, was the river Maeander, or, according to some authorities, the range of mountains which, under the name of Messogis (Kastane Dagh), forms the northern margin of the valley of the Maeander, and is a northwestern prolongation of the Taurus. From the eastern part of this range, in the southeast corner of Lydia, another branches off to the northwest, and runs to the west far out into the Aegean Sea, where it forms the peninsula opposite to the island of Chios. This chain, which is called Tmolus (Kisilja Musa Dagh), divides Lydia into two unequal valleys, of which the southern and smaller is watered by the river Caÿster, and the northern forms the great plain of the Hermus; these valleys are very beautiful and fertile, and that of the Hermus especially is one of the most delicious regions of the earth. The eastern part of Lydia and the adjacent portion of Phrygia, about the upper course of the Hermus and its tributaries, is an elevated plain, showing traces of volcanic action, and hence called Catacecaumené (<foreign lang="greek">κατακεκαυμένη</foreign>). In early times the country had another name, <ref type="cross" target="crossmaeonia">Maeonia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Μῃονιή, Μαιονία</foreign>), 
<pb n="984" /><cb />
 by which alone it is known to Homer, who is himself sometimes spoken of as Maeonides; and this name was afterwards applied specifically to the eastern and southern part of Lydia; and then, in contradistinction to it, the name Lydia was used for the northwestern part.</p>
 <p>In the mythical legends the common name of the people and country, Lydi and Lydia, is derived from Lydus, the son of Atys, the first king. The Lydians appear to have been a race closely connected with the Carians and the Mysians, with whom they observed a common worship in the temple of Zeus Carius at Mylasa; they also practised the worship of Cybelé, and other Phrygian customs. Amid the uncertainties of the early legends, it is clear that Lydia was a very early seat of Asiatic civilization, and that it exerted a very important influence on the Greeks. The Lydian monarchy, which was founded at Sardis before the time of authentic history, grew up into an Empire, under which the many different tribes of Asia Minor west of the river Halys were for the first time united. Tradition mentioned three dynasties of kings: the Atyadae, which ended (according to the backward computations of chronologers) about B.C. 1221; the Heraclidae, which reigned 505 years, down to 716; and the Mermnadae, 160 years, down to 556. Only the last dynasty can be safely regarded as historical, and the fabulous element has a large place in the details of their history; their names and computed dates were: (1) Gyges, B.C. 716-678;</p>
 <p>(2) Ardys, 678-629;</p>
 <p>(3) Sadyattes, 629-617;</p>
 <p>(4) Alyattes, 617-560;</p>
 <p>(5) Croesus, 560 (or earlier)-546, under whose names an account is given of the rise of the Lydian Empire in Asia Minor and of its overthrow by the Persians under Cyrus. Under these kings the Lydians appear to have been a highly civilized, industrious, and wealthy people, practising agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, and acquainted with various arts; and exercising, through their intercourse with the Greeks of Ionia, an important influence on the progress of Greek civilization. Among the inventions or improvements which the Greeks are said to have derived from them were the weaving and dyeing of fine fabrics; various processes of metallurgy; the use of gold and silver money, which the Lydians are said first to have coined, the former from the gold found on Tmolus and from the golden sands of the Pactolus (now Sarabat); and various metrical and musical improvements, especially the scale or mode of music called the Lydian, and the form of the lyre called the <hi rend="italic">magadis.</hi> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslyra">Lyra</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmusica">Musica</ref>.) The Lydians had, also, public games similar to those of the Greeks. Their high civilization, however, was combined with a lax morality; and after the Persian conquest, when they were forbidden by Cyrus to carry arms, they sank gradually into a by-word for effeminate luxuriousness, and their very name and language had almost entirely disappeared by the commencement of our era. Under the Persians, Lydia and Mysia formed the second satrapy. After the Macedonian conquest Lydia belonged first to the kings of Syria, and next (after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by the Romans) to those of Pergamus, and so passed, by the bequest of Attalus III., to the Romans, under whom it formed part of the province of Asia.</p>

<head orig="Lyric Poetry">Lyric Poetry</head>

 <p> While among the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greeks</hi> the elegiac and iambic poetry, which forms the transition from epic to lyric composition, was practised by the Ionians, lyric poetry proper, or, as it was more commonly called, melic poetry (<foreign lang="greek">μέλος</foreign>, “a song”) —viz., the song accompanied by music, was cultivated by the Aeolians and Dorians. This is due to the talent for music peculiar to these races. That playing on stringed instruments and singing were cultivated even in mythical times in Aeolia, in the island of Lesbos, is shown by the legend that the head and lyre of Orpheus, who had been torn to pieces by Thracian women, were washed ashore on that island, and that the head was buried in the Lesbian town of Antissa. Antissa was the native place of <ref type="cross" target="crossterpander">Terpander</ref> (q.v.), who gave artistic form to the <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign>, or hymn to Apollo, by elaborating the laws of its composition. Settling at Sparta in B.C. 676, he laid the foundation of the Dorian music. While he had closely followed Homeric poetry in the texts which he wrote for his musical compositions, there afterwards arose a greater variety in the kinds of songs, corresponding to the greater variety of musical forms, springing from the foundation laid by him. In the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aeolian</hi> lyric the pathetic prevails, as might be expected from the passionate nature of the people; the feelings of love and hatred, joy and sorrow are their principal themes. As to the metrical form we find short lines with a soft, melodious rhythm, which make up a small number of short strophes. They are written in the Aeolic dialect; we may suppose that they were solos sung to the accompaniment of stringed instruments. In Lesbos the Aeolian lyric was brought to its highest perfection by Alcaeus of Mitylené (about 600), and by his contemporary Sappho, also a Lesbian, and teacher of the poetess Erinna. The joyous poems of Anacreon of Teos (born about 550), whose subjects are love and wine, were also in the Aeolian style, but in the Ionic dialect. An echo of the Aeolian lyric are the <hi rend="italic">scolia.</hi> See <ref type="cross" target="crossscolion">Scolion</ref>.</p>
 <p>It was among the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dorians</hi>, however, that the lyric poetry of the Greeks reached the highest degree of its development. It is also called choral lyric, because the Dorian songs were intended to be sung at the public festivals, especially those of the gods, by a dancing choir to the accompaniment of stringed instruments and flutes. Intended, therefore, to be public, it naturally had on the whole an earnest, objective character, and is thus distinguished from the Aeolian lyrics that expressed the personal feelings of the poet. Their form shows further points of difference. Instead of the diminutive Aeolian strophes of short lines, unsuitable for dancing, the Dorian lyrics have ampler strophes, usually with longer lines, and the combination of strophes is again subdivided into strophe, antistrophe, and epode, of which the first two are exactly parallel, while the last differs from both in its structure. While the number of the Aeolian metres is fixed, every Dorian song has its own metre, the rhythm of which depends on the 
<pb n="986" /><cb />
 tune suitable to the subject. As to the kinds of songs, there is also a great variety in the Dorian lyric: there are paeans, <hi rend="italic">hyporchemata</hi>, hymns, <seg lang="la">prosodia, parthenia</seg>, dithyrambs, <seg lang="la">encomia, epinicia, hymenaea, epithalamia, threnoi</seg>; drinking-songs and love songs are also not wanting. They are written in the old epic dialect, influenced by Doric.</p>
 <p>With regard to their historical development, Alcman (about 660), a Lydian who had become a citizen of Sparta, was the first to compose longer and more varied poems on the lines laid down by Terpander and his school. The Dorian lyric received its later artistic form from the Sicilian Stesichorus of Himera (about 600), whose contemporary Arion first gave a place in literature to the dithyramb. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdithyrambus">Dithyrambus</ref>.) In the sixth century choral poetry became the common property of all Greeks, and so flourished more and more. Of its older representatives we have still to mention Ibycus of Rhegium (about 540), in whose choral songs the erotic element prevails. This class of poetry was brought to its greatest perfection at the time of the Persian Wars by Simonides of Ceos, by his nephew, Bacchylides, and above all by Pindar of Thebes. Besides these, Timocreon of Ialysus, and the poetesses Myrtis, Corinna, Praxilla, and Telesilla deserve mention. Of the productions of Aeolian and Dorian lyric poetry, only fragments have been preserved, except the epinician odes of Pindar. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspindarus">Pindarus</ref>.) These fragments are edited by <bibl default="NO">Bergk, <title>Poetae Graeci Lyrici</title> (1878)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>With the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi>, the first attempts to imitate the forms of the Greek “melic” date from the last years of the Republic. Laevius wrote mythological poems in a great variety of metres, the <title>Erotopaegnia</title> (“Diversions of Love”), which, however, seem to have attracted little attention. Catullus also wrote some poems in melic measures. This kind of poetry was perfected in the age of Augustus by Horace, who introduced the forms of Aeolian lyric. None of the succeeding poets were of even secondary importance, in spite of the great skill with which they handled the various melic metres; one of them, the Christian poet Prudentius, wrote as late as the fourth century. The Dorian lyric never obtained a footing among the Romans.</p>

<head orig="Lysander">Lysander</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λύσανδρος</foreign>). (1) A Spartan, who rose to eminence towards the end of the Peloponnesian War, and was placed in command of the Lacedaemonian troops, on the coast of Asia Minor, B.C. 407. Having about him little of the old Spartan severity, and being ready to sacrifice that personal and national pride and inflexibility, which were the peculiar characteristics of the Spartan institutions, to personal or national interests, he gained in an unusual degree the regard and confidence of his Persian allies. This he used to the best advantage, by seizing a favourable moment to obtain from the younger Cyrus, the Persian viceroy in Asia Minor, in place of any personal advantage, the addition of an obolus daily (somewhat more <cb /> than two cents of our money) to every seaman in the Peloponnesian fleet. During his year's command he defeated the Athenian fleet commanded by Antiochus, as lieutenant of Alcibiades, at Notium. In September, B.C. 406, he was superseded by Callicratidas, who was defeated and slain in the memorable battle of Arginusae. The allies then petitioned that Lysander might be reappointed. It was contrary to Spartan law to intrust a fleet twice to the same person; but this difficulty was evaded by nominating another individual as commander-in-chief and sending Lysander as lieutenant with the command in Asia. He soon justified the preference by gaining the decisive victory of Aegospotami, in the Hellespont, where 170 Athenian ships were taken. This, in effect, finished the war. Receiving, as he went, the submission of her allies, Lysander proceeded leisurely to Athens, and blockaded her ports, while the Spartan kings marched into Attica and invested the city, which, unassaulted, was reduced by the sure process of famine. The capitulation being settled, B.C. 404, Lysander had the proud satisfaction of entering as victor the Piraeus or harbour of Athens, which had been unviolated by the presence of an enemy since the Persian invasion. His services and reputation gained for him corresponding weight at Sparta; and, on occasion of the contested succession, his influence was powerful in raising Agesilaüs to the throne. He accompanied that eminent statesman and soldier during his first campaign in Asia, where his popularity and renown threw his superior into the shade and an estrangement resulted, in which Lysander conducted himself with temper and wisdom. About B.C. 396 he returned to Sparta. In the following year, on occasion of a quarrel with Thebes, he was sent into Phocis to collect contingents from the northern allies, a task for which his name and popularity rendered him peculiarly fit. Having done this, and being on his way to join the Lacedaemonian army, he was surprised and slain by the Thebans at Haliartus in Boeotia. The force which he had collected was dispersed, and the war at once came to an end, with no credit to the Lacedaemonians, B.C. 395.</p>
 <p>It is said that, urged by ambitious hopes, he meditated a scheme for abolishing the hereditary right of the descendants of Heracles, and rendering the Spartan throne elective, and that he had tampered largely with different oracles to promote his scheme. Xenophon, however, a contemporary historian, makes no mention of this rumour. The subject has been discussed by Thirlwall, in an appendix to the fourth volume of his <title>History of Greece.</title> This writer thinks that Lysander actually formed such a project; and that the same motive which induced the Spartan government to hush up the affair would certainly have led Xenophon carefully to avoid all allusion to it. There is a life of Lysander by Plutarch, and another by Nepos.</p>

<head orig="Lysĭas">Lysias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυσίας</foreign>). One of the ten Athenian orators. He was born at Athens, B.C. 458 or 459. His father, Cephalus, was a native of Syracuse, who settled at Athens during the time of Pericles. Cephalus was a person of considerable wealth, and lived on intimate terms with Pericles and Socrates; and his house is the supposed scene of the celebrated dialogues related in Plato's <title>Republic.</title> Lysias, at the 
<pb n="987" /><cb />
 age of fifteen, went to Thurii in Italy, with his brother Polemarchus, at the first foundation of the colony. Here he remained for thirty-two years; but, in consequence of his supporting the Athenian interests, he was obliged to leave Italy after the failure of the Athenian expedition to Sicily. He returned to Athens, B.C. 411, and carried on, in partnership with his brother Polemarchus, an extensive manufactory of shields, in which they employed as many as 120 slaves. Their wealth excited the cupidity of the Thirty Tyrants; their house was attacked one evening by an armed force while Lysias was entertaining a few friends at supper; their property was seized, and Polemarchus was taken to prison, where he was shortly after executed (B.C. 404). Lysias, by bribing some of the soldiers, escaped to the Piraeus, and sailed thence to Megara. He has given us a graphic account of his escape in his oration against Eratosthenes, who had been one of the Thirty Tyrants. Lysias actively assisted Thrasybulus in his enterprise against the Thirty; he supplied him with a large sum of money from his own resources and those of his friends, and hired a considerable body of soldiers at his own expense. In return for these services Thrasybulus proposed a decree by which the rights of citizenship should be conferred upon Lysias; but, in consequence of some informality, this decree was never carried into effect. He was, however, allowed the peculiar privileges which were sometimes granted to resident aliens (namely, <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοτέλεια</foreign>). Lysias appears to have died about B.C. 378.</p>
 <p>The author of the <title>Life of Lysias</title>, attributed to Plutarch, mentions 425 orations of his, 230 of which were considered to be genuine. There remain only 34, which are all forensic, and remarkable for the method which reigns in them. The purity, the perspicuity, the grace and simplicity which characterize the orations of Lysias, would have raised him to the highest rank in the art had they been coupled with the force and energy of Demosthenes. His style is elegant without being overornate, and is regarded as a model of the “plain” style. In the art of narration, Dionysius of Halicarnassus considers him superior to all orators in being distinct, probable, and persuasive; but, at the same time, admits that his composition is better adapted to private litigation than to important causes. The text of his harangues, as we now have it, is extremely corrupt. His masterpiece is the funeral oration in honour of those Athenians who, having been sent to the aid of the Corinthians under the command of Iphicrates, perished in battle. Lysias is said to have delivered only one of the orations which he wrote—that against Eratosthenes.</p>

 <head>Monument of <term>Lysicrătes</term></head>
 <p>One of the most graceful relics of Greek antiquity, raised in memory of a victory in the dramatic contests won by Lysicrates when he was <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>) in B.C. 334. From a slender square basement, 12 feet high by 9 feet wide, rises a small but elegant round temple. Six engaged Corinthian columns surround its circular wall and support the entablature, on <cb /> the frieze of which there is a delicate and life-like representation of a scene in the legend of Dionysus —the changing of the Tyrrhenian pirates into dolphins, for having by mistake laid hands on the god. Over the entablature is a flat dome made of a single block of marble, and from the centre of the roof rises a finial of acanthus leaves, formerly crowned by the tripod which was the prize of victory. The monument is 35 feet high, and the diameter of the inside is about 6 feet. The reliefs of the frieze are of great value, as they belong to the new Attic school of Scopas and Praxiteles. According to a tradition (which is without foundation) that Demosthenes used to study here, the monument used to be called the Lantern of Demosthenes—a name familiar to Michael Acominatos, in the second half of the twelfth century (Gregorovius, <title>Mirabilien der Stadt Athen</title>, p. 357). The true name was first restored by Transfeldt about 1674 (id. <title>Athen im Mittelalter</title>, ii. 357). See Perry's <title>Greek and Roman Sculpture</title>, pp. 473-475.

He joined the other generals of Alexander in opposing Antigonus, and it was he and Seleucus who gained the decisive victory at Ipsus over Antigonus, in which the latter fell (B.C. 301). In B.C. 291 Lysimachus was taken prisoner by Dromichaetes, king of the Getae, whose country he had invaded, but he was restored to liberty by the latter. In B.C. 287 Lysimachus and Pyrrhus expelled Demetrius from Macedonia. Pyrrhus, for a time, obtained possession of the Macedonian throne; but in the following year he was driven out of the country by Lysimachus, who now became king of Macedonia. Towards the end of his reign the aged Lysimachus put to death his son Agathocles, at the instigation of his wife, Arsinoë, daughter of Ptolemy Soter. This bloody deed alienated the minds of his subjects, and Seleucus invaded the dominions of Lysimachus. The two monarchs met in the plain of Corus (Corupedion), and Lysimachus fell in the battle that ensued, B.C. 281, in his eightieth year.
