 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴακχος</foreign>). The solemn name of Bacchus in the Lesser Eleusinian Mysteries, whose name was derived from the boisterous song called Iacchus. In these mysteries Iacchus was regarded as the son of Zeus and Demeter, and was distinguished from the Theban Bacchus (Dionysus), the son of Zeus and Semelé. In some traditions Iacchus is even called a son of Bacchus, but in others the two are identified. See the chapter on “Dionysus at Athens” in Dyer's <bibl default="NO"><title>Gods in Greece</title> (Lond. and N.

<div2 id="crossiamblichus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Iamblĭchus">Iamblichus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰάμβλιχος</foreign>). (1) A Syrian who lived in the time of the emperor Trajan. He wrote in Greek a romance called <foreign lang="greek">Βαβυλωνικά</foreign> on the loves of Rhodané and Sinonis, which is now lost, though an epitome of it is given by Photius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnovels-and-romances">Novels and Romances</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) A NeoPlatonic philosopher, a native of Chalcis in CoeleSyria. He died about A.D. 330. He was a pupil of Porphyry and a follower of Plotinus; but pushing their teachings to the point of absurdity, became a mere charlatan and impostor, seeking the reputation of a magician and wonder-worker. His writings include (i.) a life of Pythagoras (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τοῦ Πυθαγορικοῦ Βίου</foreign>) in ten books, of which four parts are extant, edited by Nauck <bibl default="NO">(1884)</bibl>; (ii.) a work on mathematics (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Κοινῆς Μαθηματικῆς Ἐπιστήμης</foreign>), edited by Friès <bibl default="NO">(1790)</bibl>; (iii.) two treatises on mystical arithmetic (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Νικομάχου Ἀριθμητικῆς Εἰσαγωγῆς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Τὰ Θεολογούμενα τῆς Ἀριθμητικῆς</foreign>), the latter edited by Ast <bibl default="NO">(1817)</bibl>; (iv.) a treatise on the Egyptian mysteries (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Μυστηρίων</foreign>), and intending to prove their divine origin, edited by Parthey <bibl default="NO">(1857)</bibl>; and (v.) a sort of introduction to the study of Plato (<foreign lang="greek">Προτρεπτικοὶ Λόγοι εἰς Φιλοσοφίαν</foreign>), edited by Kiessling <bibl default="NO">(1813)</bibl>. The treatise on the mysteries and those on arithmetic are possibly not the work of Iamblichus. On the <title>De Mysteriis</title>, see Harles, <bibl default="NO"><title>Das Buch von d. ägypt. Myst.</title> (Munich, 1858)</bibl>. It has been rendered into English by Thomas Taylor with the life of Pythagoras <bibl default="NO">(2d ed. Chiswick, 1821)</bibl>. The best account of Iamblichus will be found in Zeller, <title>Philosophie der Griechen</title>, iii. 2, pp. 613 foll. in the second edition; and in Vacherot, <title>Histoire Critique de l'École d'Alexandrie</title>, ii. pp. 57 foll. <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1851)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossianiculum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ianicŭlum">Ianiculum</head>

 <p> A hill of Rome, across the Tiber, and connected with the city by means of the Sublician bridge. From its sparkling sands it obtained the name of Mons Aureus, now by corruption Montorio. There was an ancient tradition that Ianus, king of the Aborigines, contemporary with Saturn, who then inhabited the Capitoline Hill, founded a city opposite to the residence of Saturn, and, dying, left his name to the hill on which he had built ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 355" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>viii. 355</bibl> foll.; <seg lang="la">Serv. ad loc.</seg>). Ancus Marcius joined it to the Aventine by a bridge and a wall, lest an enemy should make it a citadel for attack.</p>
 <p>The summit of the Ianiculum was seen from the Comitia, and also from the place of popular assemblies in the Campus Martius. At the earliest period of the Republic, when the Romans were surrounded by foes, and feared lest, while they held these assemblies, the enemy might come upon them unawares, they placed some of their citizens upon the Ianiculum to guard the spot, and to watch for the safety of the state; a standard was erected upon the top of the hill, and the removal of it was a signal for the assembly immediately to dissolve, because the enemy was near (Dio Cassius, xxxvii. 28). This act afterwards became a mere formal ceremony; it was, however, made subservient to the designs of factions in later times; and the taking down of the standard on the Ianiculum more than once put a stop to public proceedings at the Comitia.

<div2 id="crossianua" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ianua">Ianua</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θύρα</foreign>). A door; denoting more especially the first entrance to the house through which one entered from the street. This door was also called by the Romans <seg lang="la">anticum</seg>, and by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">θύρα αὐλεία, αὐλία</foreign>, etc. The back-door was termed <seg lang="la">posticum, postica</seg>, and <seg lang="la">posticula;</seg> in Greek, <foreign lang="greek">παράθυρος</foreign>, dim. <foreign lang="greek">παραθύριον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">κηπαία</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">θύρα</foreign>). The doors of the inner apartments were called <seg lang="la">ostia</seg>, and in Greek <foreign lang="greek">μέσαυλοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μέταυλοι</foreign>, etc. A secret door was styled <seg lang="la">pseudothyrum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ψευδόθυρον</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The complete doorway consisted of the four indispensable parts—threshold (<seg lang="la">limen</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">βηλός, ὀυδὸς ὁδός</foreign>), lintel (<seg lang="la">iugumentum, limen superum</seg>), and jambs (<seg lang="la">postes</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">σταθμοί</foreign>). Vitruvius speaks of the jambs as <seg lang="la">antepagmenta.</seg> For the hinges, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscardo">Cardo</ref>. The door itself was called <seg lang="la">foris, valva</seg>, and in Greek <foreign lang="greek">σανίς, κλισίας, θύρετρον</foreign>. It was regularly bivalve or double, and hence spoken of in the plural.</p>
 <p>The threshold was an object of reverence, and it was thought unlucky to tread on it with the left foot. On this account the steps leading into a temple were of an uneven number, because the worshipper, after placing his right foot on the bottom step, would then place the same foot on the threshold also (Vitruv. iii. 4). The doors of Greek houses regularly opened inward, and of Roman houses always so, with the single exception of the house of M. Valerius Publicola (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  112" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 112</bibl>), who was exempted from the usual rule as a special honour.</p>
 <p>As early as Homer we find mention of a contrivance for bolting or unbolting a door from the outside, <cb /> <figure id="fig.00860">
<head orig="Temple Door. (Roman bas-relief.)">Temple Door. (Roman bas-relief.)</head>
</figure> which consisted in a leathern thong (<foreign lang="greek">ἱμάς</foreign>) inserted through a hole in the door, and by means of a loop, ring, or hook (<foreign lang="greek">κλείς, κληΐς</foreign>), which was the origin of keys, capable of laying hold of the bolt so as to move it in the manner required (<title>Odyss.</title> i. 442; iv. 802). The bolt by the progress of improvement was transformed into a lock, and the keys found at Herculaneum and Pompeii and those attached to rings prove that among the Greeks and Romans the art of the locksmith (<foreign lang="greek">κλειδοποιός</foreign>) approached very nearly to its present state. See <ref type="cross" target="crossclavis">Clavis</ref>.</p>
 <p>By night the front door of the house was further secured by means of a wooden and sometimes an iron bar (<seg lang="la">sera, repagula</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">μοχλός</foreign>) placed across it, and inserted into sockets, on each side of the doorway. Hence it was necessary to remove the bar in order to open the door (<seg lang="la">reserare</seg>). Even chamber doors were secured in the same manner (Heliodor. vi. 9); and here also, in case of need, the bar was employed as a further security in addition to the two bolts (Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1551" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orest.</title>1551</bibl><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1571" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orest., 1571</bibl>; <title>Iph. Aul.</title> 345; <title>Androm.</title> 951). Where, as in the case of tyrants, midnight assassination was especially dreaded, we read of a bedchamber secured with a portcullis ( <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Arat.</title>26</bibl>). To fasten the door with the bolt was <seg lang="la">ianuae pessulum obdere</seg>, with the bar, <seg lang="la">ianuam obserare.</seg> At Athens a jealous husband sometimes even sealed the door of the women's apartment ( <title>Thesm.</title> 427; Menand. <title>Incert.</title> 1, 11). The door of a bedchamber was occasionally covered with a curtain (<seg lang="la">velum</seg>). See <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">Domus</ref>.

<div2 id="crossianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ianus">Ianus</head>

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Iana.</hi> Two ancient Latin divinities, who were worshipped as the sun and moon. The names Ianus and Iana were thought to be other forms of Dianus and Diana (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> i. 37, 3; Macrob. i. 9), which words contain the same root as <seg lang="la">dies</seg>, day. The ancients, however, also connected the words with <seg lang="la">ianua</seg>, a door, which itself contains the root of <seg lang="la">ire</seg>, “to go.” Ianus occupied an important place in the Roman religion. He presided over the beginning of everything, and was 
<pb n="861" /><cb />
 therefore always invoked first in every undertaking, even before Iupiter. He opened the year and the seasons, and hence the first month of the year was called after him (<title>mensis Iani</title>, Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, ii. 51). He was the porter of heaven, and therefore bore the surnames Patulcus or Patulcius (<seg lang="la">pateo</seg>), “the opener,” and Clusius or Clusivius (<hi rend="italic">cludo</hi>), “the shutter” (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, 130). On earth, also, he was the guardian deity of gates, and hence is commonly represented with two heads, because every door looks two ways (<title>Ianus bifrons</title>). He is sometimes represented with four heads (<title>Ianus quadrifrons</title>), because he presided over the four seasons. At Rome, Numa is said to have dedicated to Ianus the covered passage bearing his name, which is commonly, but erroneously, called a temple. It stood close by the Forum. A temple to Ianus was <figure id="fig.00861">
<head orig="Temple of Ianus. (Coin of Nero.)">Temple of Ianus. (Coin of Nero.)</head>
</figure> built by Duilius, to take the place of this passage; and was restored by Augustus. It appears to have been left open in war to indicate symbolically that the god had gone out to assist the Roman warriors, and to have been shut in time of peace that the god, the safeguard of the city, might not escape. The gates of Ianus were closed only three times from Numa to Augustus, and twice by Augustus. On New-year's day, which was the principal festival of the god, people gave presents to one another, consisting of sweetmeats and copper coins, showing on one side the double head of Ianus (see illustration under <ref type="cross" target="crossbifrons">Bifrons</ref>) and on the other a ship. The general name for these presents was <seg lang="la">strenae</seg>, the modern French <foreign lang="fr">étrennes.</foreign></p>
 <p>The connection of Ianus with the year was indicated by representing him with three fingers of his right hand bent so as to suggest the numeral CCC (300), while the fingers of the left hand were spread for the numerals L+V (55), and in later times L+V+V+V (65), for the 355 days of the old Roman year and 365 of the Julian year (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 7</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰαπυγία</foreign>). A division of Italy, forming what is called the heel. It was called also Messapia, and contained two nations, the Calabri on the northeast, and the Salentini on the southwest side. The name of Iapygia was not known to the Romans, except as an appellation borrowed from the Greeks, to whom it was familiar. Among the many traditions current with the latter people may be reckoned their derivation of this name from Iapyx, the son of Daedalus (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iii. 11</bibl>). This story, however, belongs rather to fable than to history. There is no positive evidence regarding the origin of the Iapyges, but their existence on these shores prior to the arrival of any Grecian colony is recognized by the earliest writers of that nation, such as Herodotus (vii. 170) and Hellanicus of Lesbos (<hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Dion. Hal. i. 22). Thucydides evidently considered them as barbarians (vii. 33), as did also Scylax, in his <title>Periplus</title>, and Pausanias (x. 1). It may be noticed that the name of the Iapyges appears on one of the Eugubine Tables under the form <title>Iapuscom</title>, which might lead one to suppose that some connection once existed between this people and the Umbri.

<head orig="Iason">Iason</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰάσων</foreign>). (1) Son of Aeson and Polymedé or Alcimedé. He was the celebrated leader of the Argonauts. His father, Aeson, who reigned at Iolcus in Thessaly, was deprived of the kingdom by his half-brother Pelias, who attempted to take the life of the infant Iason. He was saved by his friends, and intrusted to the care of the centaur Chiron. When he had grown up he came to Iolcus, and demanded the kingdom, which Pelias promised to surrender to him, provided he brought the golden fleece, which was in the possession of King Aeëtes in Colchis, and was guarded by an ever-watchful dragon. Iason willingly undertook the enterprise, and set sail in the ship Argo, accompanied by the chief heroes of Greece. He obtained the fleece with the assistance of Medea, whom he made his wife, and along with whom he returned to Iolcus. The history of his exploits on this enterprise is related elsewhere. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossargonautae">Argonautae</ref>.) In order to avenge the death of his father, who had been slain by Pelias during his absence, Medea, at the instigation of Iason, persuaded the daughters of Pelias to cut their father to pieces and boil him, in order to restore him to youth and vigour, as she had before changed a ram into a lamb, by boiling the ram in a caldron. Pelias thus perished miserably; and his son Acastus expelled Iason and Medea from Iolcus. They then went to Corinth, where they lived happily for several years, until Iason deserted Medea, in order to marry Glaucé (or Creüsa), daughter of Creon , the king of the country. Medea fearfully revenged this insult. She sent Glaucé a poisoned garment, which burned her to death when she put it on. Creon likewise perished in the flames. Medea also killed her children by Iason, and then fled to Athens in a chariot drawn by winged dragons. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmedea">Medea</ref>.) The death of Iason is related variously. According to some, he made away with himself from grief; according to others, he was crushed by the poop of the ship Argo, which fell upon him as he was lying under it.</p>
 <p>(2) Tyrant of Pherae, elected Tagus or military chief of Thessaly, B.C. 374. He possessed great power, and aspired to the sovereignty of Greece, but was assassinated in 370. He was a man of much ability and culture, and was the friend of Isocrates and admirer of Gorgias.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴβυκος</foreign>). A Greek lyric and erotic poet of Rhegium in Lower Italy, who flourished about B.C. 530. Like Anacreon, he led a roving life, and spent much of his time at the court of Polycrates of Samos. According to his epitaph, he died in his native town; but according to the legend made familiar by Schiller's poem, he was slain on a journey to Corinth, and his murderers were discovered by means of a flock of cranes, which, as he died, he had invoked as his avengers. The story goes that, after his murder, when the Corinthians were gathered in the theatre, the cranes appeared; whereupon one of the assassins who was present cried out, “See the avengers of Ibycus!” thus giving a clue to their detection. Hence arose the expression used of the cranes, <foreign lang="greek">Ἰβύκου γέρανοι</foreign>. His poems, which were collected into seven books, survive in scanty fragments only. They dealt partly with mythological themes in the metres of Stesichorus and partly with love-songs in the spirit of Aeolic lyric poetry, full of glowing passion and sensibility. It was mainly to the latter that he owed his fame.

Lower down, the slopes of the mountain are well wooded; and lower still, they form fertile fields and valleys. The sources of the Scamander, the Simoïs, and the Granicus, besides other rivers and numerous brooks, are on Ida. The mountain is celebrated in mythology, as the scene of the rape of Ganymedes, whom Ovid (<title>Fasti</title>, ii. 145) calls <title>Idaeus puer</title>, and of the judgment of Paris, who is called <title>Idaeus iudex</title> by Ovid (<title>Fasti</title>, vi. 44), and <title>Idaeus pastor</title> by Cicero (<title>Ad Att.</title> i. 18). In Homer, too, its summit is the place from which the gods watch the battles in the plain of Troy. Ida was also an ancient seat of the worship of Cybelé, who obtained from it the name of <title>Idaea Mater.</title></p>
 <p>(2) Now Psilorati; a mountain in the centre of Crete, belonging to the mountain range which runs through the whole length of the island. Mount Ida is 8055 feet above the level of the sea. It was closely connected with the worship of Zeus, who is fabled to have been reared in a cave in this mountain.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴδας</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Lynceus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυγκεύς</foreign>). The sons of Aphareus of Messenia and of Arené; two brothers as heroic and inseparable as their cousins Castor and Pollux (Polydeuces). The nymph Marpessa, daughter of the Acarnanian river-god Euenus, was wooed by Apollo, when Idas carried her off in a winged chariot given him by Poseidon. When Apollo overtook the fugitives in Messenia, Idas, who was then the strongest of living men ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 556" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>ix. 556</bibl>), stretched his bow against Apollo. Zeus interposed and gave the girl her choice of suitors; she decided in favour of the mortal, as she feared that Apollo would desert her. After that the god detested her; and both she and her beautiful daughter Cleopatra or Alcyoné, wife of Meléager, and also their daughter, all died young, and brought misfortune on those that loved them. Idas and Lynceus, who could see even into the heart of the earth, joined in the Calydonian hunt and the Argonautic expedition. They met their deaths fighting Castor and Pollux, with whom they had been brought up. As they were all returning from a raid into Arcadia, Idas was appointed to divide the cattle they had captured; <cb /> he divided an ox into four portions and decided that whosoever devoured his portion first was to have the first half of the spoil, and he who finished his next, the second half. He finished his own and his brother's share first, and then drove the cattle away. The Dioscuri were enraged and hid themselves from the brothers in a hollow oak-tree; but the keen sight of Lynceus detected their lurking-place, and Idas stabbed Castor in the tree. Thereupon Pollux pierced Lynceus through, while Idas was slain by the lightning of Zeus. For another account of the origin of the quarrel, see <ref type="cross" target="crossdioscuri">Dioscuri</ref>.

His son came out to meet him, and was accordingly sacrificed; a plague thereupon broke out, he was banished by the Cretans, and betook himself to Calabria.

In the Old Testament, Edom is the district of Mount Seir, that is, the mountainous region extending from the Dead Sea to the eastern head of the Red Sea. The decline of the kingdom of Iudaea enabled the Edomites to extend their power over the southern part of Iudaea 
<pb n="865" /><cb /> as far as Hebron, while their original territory was taken possession of by the Nabathaean Arabs. Thus the Idumaea of the later Jewish and of the Roman history is the southern part of Iudaea, and a small portion of the north of Arabia Petraea, extending from the Mediterranean to the west side of Mount Seir. Antipater, the father of Herod the Great, was an Idumaean. The Roman writers of the Augustan and of later ages use Idumaea and Iudaea as equivalent terms.

<head orig="Ignatius">Ignatius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰγνάτιος</foreign>). A martyr who suffered at Rome during the third persecution of the Christians. He was a Syrian by birth, and an immediate disciple of St. John the Evangelist, who, in A.D. 67, committed the church at Antioch to his pastoral superintendence, as successor to Euodius. Over this bishopric he presided for upwards of forty years, when the emperor Trajan, after his triumph over the Dacians, entering the city, exercised many severities towards those who professed the Christian faith, and summoned the prelate himself before him, on which occasion Ignatius conducted himself with such boldness in the imperial presence that he was sent to Rome, and ordered to be exposed in the amphitheatre to the fury of wild beasts. This dreadful death he underwent (October 17) with great fortitude, having availed himself of the interval between his sentence and its execution to strengthen, by his exhortations, the faith of the Roman converts. After his decease, which took place A.D. 107, or, according to some accounts, A.D. 116, his remains were carried to Antioch for interment.</p>
 <p>It is reported that Ignatius was one of the little children whom Jesus took up in his arms and blessed, whence he was called Theophorus or “God-borne”; and it is certain that he conversed familiarly with the Apostles, and was perfectly acquainted with their doctrine. <cb /> Of his works there remain seven genuine epistles, on the various forms of which see <bibl default="NO">Zahn, <title>Ignatios von Antiochien</title> (1873)</bibl>, and Bishop Lightfoot, <title>The Apostolic Fathers</title>, pt. ii. 2d ed. <bibl default="NO">(1889)</bibl>.

<head orig="Igniaria">Igniaria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πυρεῖα</foreign>). Fire-sticks. One of the earliest methods of producing fire was by the friction of two specially prepared sticks—a method which Lucretius (<bibl n="Lucr. 5.199" default="NO" valid="yes">v. 199</bibl>) supposes the primitive peoples to have learned from the ignition of forest trees by friction. (Cf. Thuc. ii. 77; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 16. 208" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xvi. 208</bibl>). It was the means prescribed by Roman usage for relighting the vestal fire when by any oversight it became extinguished. In Greece, the sacred flame was rekindled from the sun's rays by the use of burning-glasses ( <title>Numa</title>, 9). Seneca (<title>Nat. Quaest.</title> ii. 22) speaks of producing fire from flints, and also from <seg lang="la">igniaria.</seg> These last were (1) a block of soft wood with a hollow in it, and called <foreign lang="greek">ἐσχάρα</foreign>, and</p>
 <p>(2) a bit of hard wood (<foreign lang="greek">τρύπανον</foreign>). The <foreign lang="greek">τρύπανον</foreign> was whirled around in the hollow of the former. The sparks produced by this friction were caught in a sort of tinder made of dried grass and shavings. Instead of this primitive tinder the ancients also used bits of wood smeared with sulphur (<seg lang="la">ramenta sulpurata</seg>), such as were common in modern times until the invention of lucifer matches in the present century. With these, the sparks produced from the <seg lang="la">igniaria</seg> or from the flints were caught; and these more quickly and surely ignited than the ordinary tinder, saving both time and breath.

In the Greek myths Ilios was founded by Ilus, son of Tros and greatgrandson of Dardanus. In the reign of Laomedon, son of Ilus, the city was fortified with huge walls by Poseidon and Apollo; but as Laomedon refused to pay the price agreed upon for this service, he incurred the hostility of his mighty assistants. Laomedon was succeeded by his son Podarces, or Priam, who became a great monarch, with fifty sons, including Hector and Paris, and twelve daughters. Paris, by the help of Aphrodité, carried off Helen, wife of Menelaüs, king of Sparta; and to avenge this insult an army of Achaeans besieged the city for ten years, and finally captured and destroyed it.

 <p>It is impossible to determine how much, if any, of historical truth is contained in these legends, and particularly in the Homeric account of the Trojan War. But recent excavations have done much to show that the siege of Troy was not all a myth. Where the ancient city stood, or where the poet conceived that it stood, has been the subject of endless discussion. A brief history of this controversy will be the best introduction to an account of the present state of the question.</p>
 <p>Long after the assumed date of the fall of Troy, but before the Persian wars, the Greek town of (Novum) Ilium was founded at the low mound of Hissarlik (pl. i.), nearly four miles from the Hellespont at Sigēum and about three miles from the nearest point on the coast. Its inhabitants asserted that the city of Priam had never been completely destroyed and that their own town was the immediate successor of Homeric Ilios. This claim seems to have been generally allowed. Hellanīcus expressly approved it, and Herodotus describes, without dissent, the visit of Xerxes to the spot, to which he was drawn by its legendary fame. The Spartan admiral Mindarus, during the <cb /> Peloponnesian War, and Alexander the Great, almost a century later, each offered sacrifice to the Ilian Athené, in recognition of the ancient glory of the town. But in the second century B.C. Demetrius of Scepsis advanced the theory that Homeric Troy could not have stood on the site of (Novum) Ilium. His chief reasons were: (1) that the plain between Ilium and the sea was an alluvial deposit, and must have been far too small, in the days of Homer, for the mighty combats described in the <title>Iliad;</title></p>
 <p>(2) the flight of Hector from Achilles three times around the walls of the city could not have taken place at the site of Ilium, for the mound on which the latter stands (the modern Hissarlik) was not an isolated hill, but a spur from Mount Ida, so that at one point the runners would have had to ascend a considerable incline. Demetrius would look for ancient Ilios apparently at a site now called Hanaï-tepeh, opposite Bunárbashi (pl. i.). In these opinions he was followed by Strabo, our chief authority for the geography of the Troad; and most modern scholars, until recent years, including such men as Welcker, Kiepert, Von Moltke, E. Curtius, and Jebb, have agreed with them. It has been the accepted belief that it was impossible to separate truth from fiction in the <title>Iliad</title>, and that we must not therefore hope to find anywhere a site exactly corresponding to the poet's description. According to this modern view, the ancient capital of the Troad was situated on a high hill called Bali Dagh, much farther inland than Hissarlik, and this mountain fortress was transformed, by the poet's imaginaton, into a great city—the capital of a mighty empire. George Grote almost alone, with his usual perspicacity, maintained that there was “every reason for presuming that the Ilium visited by Xerxes and Alexander was the holy Ilium present to the mind of Homer;” and the excavations of the last two decades have rendered it quite certain that he was right in his adherence to the general opinion of antiquity.</p>
 <p>But before giving an account of these excavations, it may be well to glance at some of the circumstances which seem to favor the Hissarlik site. Its distance from the coast is such as to agree with the Homeric conception of the rapid ebb and flow of the tide of battle between the ships and the city walls, and the frequent and speedy journeys of messengers, and king Priam himself. The situation on the level plain, but with the low mound of from fifty to sixty-five feet in height for the citadel, is more favourable for a great and wealthy city than the almost inaccessible steep of Bali Dagh; while the latter is too far from the coast (over ten miles) to meet the conditions mentioned above. Professor Virchow has shown that the river Scamander (Menderé), which now discharges near Cape Sigēum, must formerly have followed the course of the present KalifatliAsmak, farther north, thus bringing it between the city and the ships, and providing for its union with the Simois (Dumbrek-su); and so removing all objection to the Hissarlik site on this score. The view of Demetrius, that the plain is an alluvial deposit (see above), is clearly founded on Herodotus ii. 11, where it is stated that the plain was originally a bay. But Herodotus manifestly did not think that the plain lay under water in the Trojan period, for he could not, in that case, have believed in the identity of Troy and Ilium, as his recital of the visit of Xerxes would seem to indicate 
<pb n="867" /><cb /> that he did. The statement, if true, must refer to some remote period of antiquity, for Scylax ( <bibl n="Hanno Peripl. 94" default="NO"> <title>Peripl.</title>94</bibl>) makes the distance of Ilium from the sea almost precisely the same as the distance from Hissarlik to-day, showing that the alluvial deposit has not materially extended the plain in the last 2000 years, at least. The objection to the Hissarlik site, based upon the flight of Hector <figure id="fig.00867">
<head orig="Map of the Troad.">Map of the Troad.</head>
</figure> around the walls, amounts to nothing, since this whole story is manifestly a poetic exaggeration, like the battle of Achilles with the Scamander; and we need not expect to find the exact spot where such fictitious and impossible occurrences took place. But if importance is attached to this point, it may be added that recent excavations prove that this ridge was originally about forty feet lower than at present, as it was gradually raised by the clearing away of debris from the citadel mound. At its former insignificant height it might easily have been surmounted by the two stout warriors. It may be added that the ruins on the Bali Dagh consist of nothing more than the remains of a small <cb /> circuit wall, indicating that we have to do with an unimportant mountain fortress, which may have commanded the Scamander gorge—a fortress which could never have been described as a great and populous city “on the plain” (<title>Iliad</title>, xx. 217).</p>
 <p>It would thus appear that on topographical grounds alone the question, though a difficult one, might fairly be decided in favour of the Hissarlik site. It remains to show how recent discoveries have converted this probability into a practical certainty. In 1870 Dr. Heinrich <ref type="cross" target="crossschliemann">Schliemann</ref> (q.v.), a retired German merchant and enthusiastic archaeologist, began his excavations at Hissarlik. These excavations were continued, with various interruptions, until his death in 1890. During their progress, the scholarly world, incredulous at first, gradually came more and more to the belief that the Homeric Ilios had actually been found. After 1882 Schliemann had the coöperation of Dr. W. Dörpfeld, afterwards secretary of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens, whose adhesion added much to the weight of authority in favour of Schliemann's views. The remains which have been unearthed were found in no less than seven different layers, of which the uppermost contained what could be positively identified as ruins of the Hellenistic and Roman city of Ilium. The four layers below this contained nothing but traces of small and mean buildings of a village character. It was in the two lowest layers that the most interesting discoveries were made. The lowest settlement of all was built upon the solid rock, and the remains consisted of fortification walls eight feet thick, built of rough limestone (pl. ii. fa, fb, fc), with house walls (f f f), two to three feet in thickness, of small stones cemented with clay. Utensils were found, very rarely of metal, but usually of stone, with vases of black baked clay. The potter's wheel was apparently known to the inhabitants of this settlement, but was not so often employed as later. The debris of this first city, which Schliemann decided to be pre-Homeric, is about eight feet in depth. Above this was a layer of earth nearly two feet in thickness, showing a long period of desertion, and over this the great layer of debris, in which were found the remains of the second city, now generally believed to be Homeric Ilios.</p>
 <p>Here the great citadel walls (c, b) were discovered. 
<pb n="868" /><cb /> These consisted of a stone substructure 13 feet wide at the top, which is level, the depth varying according to the irregularities of the surface below. On this was built a wall of brick, from 11 to 13 feet in thickness, and rising originally, as well as can be estimated, to a height of 13 feet. These bricks are sundried, and measure 18X9X3 1/2 inches. In the walls were found long, hollow channels, one foot square, which Dr. Dörpfeld first considered to have been made for the purpose of conducting heat to bake the bricks after the wall had been built. But this theory has now been abandoned, and it is generally believed that the marks of heat about these channels were caused, at the time of the destruction of the city, by the burning of beams which had been imbedded in the walls to give them <figure id="fig.00868">
<head orig="Plan of the Acropolis of the Second Ilios. (Schuchhardt.)">Plan of the Acropolis of the Second Ilios. (Schuchhardt.)</head>
</figure> stronger cohesion. These circuit walls seem to have formed an equilateral of about 165 feet on each side, with projecting bastions at the corners. The walls are pierced by several gates, of which the central one on the south side is the oldest (NF). This consists of a tower 130 feet long by 59 feet broad, and projecting 59 feet beyond the wall. Through this tower the road to the citadel passed, and by means of the projecting wing was protected all the way from the foot of the acropolis hill. The side walls of this passage were buttressed with thick wooden braces, which were probably connected at the top, thus forming a continuous flat roof over the whole gateway. <cb /> Such a roofed gate we may suppose the poet to have had in mind in <title>Iliad</title>, iii. 145, when he describes the elders as sitting “on the Scaean gates.” The other two gates (FM, OX) cannot be described for lack of space.</p>
 <p>In the centre of the citadel lies the building, which is generally considered to be the palace. The ruins consist of a gateway (C), opening upon the courtyard, beyond which stand the chief apartments of the palace, the megaron or men's apartment on the left (A) and the women's apartments on the right (B). The megaron is 66 feet in depth, with an entrance hall 37 feet square in front of it, and in its centre are slight remains of a large round hearth, which thus occupied the central point of the whole palace, as described in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey </title>( <bibl n="Homer Od. 14. 158" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xiv. 158</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The women's apartment is considerably smaller, consisting of a series of three rooms 15 feet wide and 20, 24, and 29 feet long respectively.</p>
 <p>But besides these remains of walls and buildings, numerous articles of gold and silver were found by Dr. Schliemann, showing conclusively that the ruins were those of a prosperous and wealthy city. In May, 1873, the so-called “great treasure” was found buried within the fortification wall, near the southwestern gate (F). This consisted of a great variety of articles, packed into one another in the form of a rectangular mass, apparently placed originally in a wooden chest, and stored for safe keeping in a hollow in the wall. 
<pb n="869" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The most valuable were two large diadems of gold, formed of a number of small pendant chains of beautiful workmanship. Gold earrings were found in large numbers, as well as cups, vases, bracelets, and other ornaments of gold or silver, with spear-heads, battle-axes, and knife blades, and numerous other articles of various kinds.</p>
 <p>Space will not allow a description of the remains found in the five upper layers, which are not materially different from those of the same period elsewhere. But in general it may be said that these excavations show that the hill of Hissarlik was inhabited, without serious interruption, from the late Graeco-Roman period back to a time before the dawn of history. At a date so early that we cannot estimate it even approximately the hill was covered with fortifications and palaces. Captain E. Bötticher, to be sure, has attempted to prove that the so-called citadel is nothing but a huge fire-necropolis, and even went so far as to accuse Schliemann of ill faith in describing what he found. But a conference of scholars, which met at Hissarlik in March, 1890, at Schliemann's invitation, decided: (1) that the site was well suited for a fortress;</p>
 <p>(2) that traces of fortifications of different epochs can be seen there;</p>
 <p>(3) that the “corridors” of Bötticher did not exist;</p>
 <p>(4) that the hill did not consist of a series of artificial terraces, each smaller than the one below. On the contrary each layer occupies more space than the one below it (showing the gradual extension by the accumulation of debris);</p>
 <p>(5) that the ruins in the second layer resemble those at Tiryns and Mycenae;</p>
 <p>(6) that the numerous upright jars which were found contained grain and not human bones;</p>
 <p>(7) that no traces were found of the burning of corpses. This decision overthrew the theory of Bötticher (who was indeed compelled to withdraw his accusation of bad faith), and went far to satisfy scholars that Schliemann's discoveries have actually revealed the site of Homeric Ilios.</p>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Illyris,</hi> more rarely <hi rend="bold">Illyria</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ Ἰλλυρικόν, Ἰλλυρίς, Ἰλλυρία</foreign>), included, in its widest signification, all the land west of Macedonia and east of Italy and Rhaetia, extending south as far as Epirus, and north as far as the valleys of the Savus and Dravus, and the junction of these rivers with the Danube. This wide extent of country was inhabited by numerous Illyrian tribes, all of whom were more or less barbarous. They were probably of the same origin as the Thracians. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.) The country was divided into two parts. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Illyris Barbăra</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romāna</hi>, the Roman province of <ref type="cross" target="crossillyricum">Illyrĭcum</ref>, extended along the Adriatic sea from Italy (Istria), from which it was separated by the Arsia, to the river Drilo, and was bounded on the east by Macedonia and Moesia Superior, from which it was separated by the Drinus, and on the north by Pannonia, from which it was separated by the Dravus. It thus comprehended a part of the modern Croatia, the whole of Dalmatia, almost the whole of Bosnia, and a part of Albania. It was divided in ancient times into three districts, according to the tribes by which it was inhabited—Iapydia, the interior of the country on the north, from the Arsia to the Tedanius; Liburnia, along the coast from the Arsia to the Titius; and Dalmatia, south of Liburnia, along the coast from the Titius to the Drilo. The Liburnians submitted at an early time to the Romans; but it was not till after the conquest of the Dalmatians, in the reign of Augustus, that the entire country was organized as a Roman province. From this time the Illyrians, and especially the Dalmatians, formed an important part of the Roman legion.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Illyris Graeca</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Illyria Propria</hi>, also called <ref type="cross" target="crossepirus-nova">Epīrus Nova</ref>, extended from the Drilo, along the Adriatic, to the Ceraunian Mountains, which separated it from Epirus proper; it was bounded on the east by Macedonia. It thus embraced the greater part of the modern Albania. 
<pb n="870" /><cb /></p>
 <p>It was a mountainous country, but possessed some fertile land on the coast. Its principal rivers were the Aoüs, Apsus, Genusus, and Panyasus. In the interior was an important lake, the Lychnitis. On the coast there were the Greek colonies of Epidamnus, afterwards Dyrrhachium, and Apollonia. It was at these places that the celebrated Via Egnatia commenced, which ran through Macedonia to Byzantium. The country was inhabited by various tribes—Atintanes, Taulantii, Parthini, Dassaretae, etc. In early times they were troublesome and dangerous neighbours to the Macedonian kings. They were subdued by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who defeated and slew in battle their king, Bardylis, in B.C. 359. After the death of Alexander the Great, most of the Illyrian tribes recovered their independence. At a later time the injury which the Roman trade suffered from their piracies brought against them the arms of the Republic. The forces of their queen, Teuta, were easily defeated by the Romans, and she was obliged to purchase peace by the surrender of part of her dominions and the payment of an annual tribute (B.C. 229). The second Illyrian war was finished by the Romans with the same ease. It was commenced by Demetrius of Pharos, who was guardian of Pineus, the son of Agron, but he was conquered by the consul Aemilius Paulus in 219. Pineus was succeeded by Pleuratus, who cultivated friendly relations with the Romans. His son Gentius formed an alliance with Perseus, king of Macedonia, against Rome; but he was conquered by the praetor L. Anicius, in the same year as Perseus (168); whereupon Illyria, as well as Macedonia, became subject to Rome. See Bahr, <bibl default="NO"><title>Illyrien</title> (Leipzig, 1876)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>In the new division of the Empire under Constantine, Illyricum formed one of the great provinces. It was divided into <hi rend="SmallCaps">Illyricum Occidentalé</hi>, which included Illyricum Propria, Pannonia, and Noricum, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Illyricum Orientalé</hi>, which comprehended Dacia, Moesia, Macedonia, and Thrace.

<head orig="Imperātor">Imperator</head>

 <p> A Roman title, originally the designation of each separate possessor of an independent command (<seg lang="la">imperium</seg>). In the course of time <figure id="fig.00871">
<head orig="Augustus. (Glyptothek, Munich.)">Augustus. (Glyptothek, Munich.)</head>
</figure> it became customary to assume the title after a man had gained his first great victory, usually after having been greeted as imperator either by the soldiers on the battlefield, or by the decree of the Senate. Under the Empire the title, which was seldom conferred by Augustus, was granted for the last time by Tiberius, A.D. 22. It was usually followed by a triumph, and ceased when the triumph was over. As a permanent title, it was first assumed by Caesar, whose adopted son and heir, Octavian (Augustus), bore it as an inherited cognomen, and from the year B.C. 40 onwards, according to a custom that arose at that time, <cb /> substituted it for his previous praenomen Gaius , instead of Caesar Imperator (Mommsen, <title>Staatsr.</title> ii.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> pp. 767-770). His immediate successors, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius abstained from using this praenomen; Nero used it frequently, but it first became permanent with Vespasian. The emperors also took the title Imperator, in its earlier signification, after a victory won by themselves or on their behalf. See <ref type="cross" target="crossimperium">Imperium</ref>.

<div2 id="crossimperium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Imperium">Imperium</head>

 <p> The full kingly power among the Romans, the royal authority over all members of the State. It was conferred on the newly-elected king by the Comitia Curiata, a formal assembly of the patricians comprising the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>, and it consisted of the rights of levying the citizens for military service, of leading the army, of celebrating a triumph, of exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction, and of inflicting punishment on the citizens, whether corporal or capital, or such as affected either their property or their liberty. A symbol of this authority was the axe and the bundle of rods borne by the lictors. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfasces">Fasces</ref>.</p>
 <p>At the establishment of the Republic the imperium was transferred to the two consuls, as the successors of the kings; but the full power of the imperium was then limited by the fact that both possessed the same power, and that, in the penalties they inflicted in times of peace, they were subject to the right of appeal (see <ref type="cross" target="crossprovocatio">Provocatio</ref>), and to the intervention of the tribunes of the people, after the institution of that office. When the consulship was deprived of its civil jurisdiction and the praetorship instituted for this purpose, the praetors also received the imperium; nevertheless it was more limited (<seg lang="la">minus</seg>) than that of the consuls, who, in contrast with the praetors and all other magistrates except the tribunes, had the right of ordering and forbidding. The imperium in its undivided and unlimited form was conferred on those who in exceptional cases were appointed dictators. It was also possessed by the <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi>, but for five days only. For consuls and praetors the imperium could be prorogued, i. e. prolonged beyond their time of office; but the imperium thus prolonged was <seg lang="la">finitum</seg>, i. e. bounded within the limits of their province. In the Republic it could also be conferred by means of the Comitia Curiata, but this act fell into a mere formality. Under the Empire the term imperium included the highest military authority, which resided in the emperor and was the foundation of all his power. It was taken up either at the instance of the Senate or the troops. Its full validity depended on its recognition by both. See <ref type="cross" target="crossprinceps">Princeps</ref>.

Inachus is said, in the old legend, to have given his name to the principal river of Argolis. Hence, probably, he was described as the son of Oceanus, the common parent of all rivers.

<div2 id="crossindia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="India">India</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰνδία</foreign>). India is the middle one of the three great land-masses that jut southward from the mainland of Asia. In shape it is somewhat like a lozenge or diamond, with land-boundaries to the north and water-boundaries to the south. The northern half is wedged in between the Himalayan and the Sulaiman ranges, which thus form respectively its northeastern and northwestern frontiers; while the southern half, tapering to a point at Cape Comorin, projects into the Indian Ocean, and is washed by the Arabian Sea on the southwest and by the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. Its area is nigh 1,500,000 square miles—that is, nearly one-half (about 5/12) that of the United States, or almost equal to that of all Europe less Russia.</p>
 <p>In respect of physical configuration, India may be divided into three very distinct parts: the Himalayan region; the river plains of the Indus and Ganges, or the Indo-Gangetic plain; and Peninsular India. The last is a triangular plateau which forms the southern half of the “lozenge.” The Himalaya shuts off India from Central Asia by an almost impassable barrier on the north. The Indus, flowing northwest, drains the back of the western half of the range; then, turning a right angle to the left, it breaks through the mountains, and receiving the affluents which with it drain the Punjab (Persian, <title>Panj-āb</title>, “Five-river” land) flows in a general southwesterly direction to the Arabian Sea. The Ganges, with its feeders, drains the southern slopes of the range and flows in a general southeasterly direction into the Bay of Bengal. The watershed between the drainage basins of the Indus and the Ganges is scarce a thousand feet above sea-level, and the slope on each side is imperceptible. The “basins,” therefore, form one practically continuous “plain.” This Indo-Gangetic plain is a vast alluvial formation, made by deposits of rich silt brought down by the rivers, and has accordingly been the principal scene of Indic civilization.</p>
 <p>The home of the earliest and most primitive Indic civilization, as indicated by the geographical allusions of the Vedas, was the Punjab, the region of the middle Indus and its tributaries. Later, the scene shifts to the southeast, to the valley of the Ganges and its most important affluent, the Jumna. This is the “Middle Country” (Sanskrit, <foreign lang="sanskrit">madhya-des/a</foreign>), the fertile region in which occur the chief events of the great Epic period and of the rise and bloom of Buddhism.</p>
 <p>For the country above defined as India, there is no comprehensive name in the oldest native literature. Later books call it <title>Jambu-dvīpa</title>, “Land of the Rose-apple;” and the great Gangetic region is named “The Bhāratan” (Sanskrit, <foreign lang="sanskrit">bhArata</foreign>), or also <foreign lang="sanskrit">Arya-Avarta</foreign>, “Home of the Aryans.” The French take their name for Germany—Allemagne —from that of the region of the tribe—the Alemanni—nearest themselves, and then extend it to the whole country. Similarly the Greeks. Their names for India—<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Ἰνδία, ἡ Ἰνδική</foreign>—apply properly only to the westernmost part of India, the region of the Indus. In Sanskrit, <foreign lang="sanskrit">sindhu-s</foreign> (the <title>Hindu-sh</title> of the ancient Persians) means “stream,” and then “<title>The</title> Stream,” that is, “The Indus, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ Ἰνδός</foreign>” (<title>incolis Sindus appellatus</title>, says Pliny ), and finally also “The region on the Indus.”</p>
 <p>Subjoined are the names of the tributaries of the Indus in order from west to east—first the Sanskrit form, 
<pb n="874" /><cb /> then the Greek, and then the modern name: <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"><foreign lang="sanskrit">vitastA</foreign></cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"><foreign lang="greek">Ὑδάσπης</foreign></cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">Jehlam</cell> </row>

 <p>The Asiknī was known later as the Chandrabhāgā, a name to the Macedonian ears so ominously like <foreign lang="greek">Σανδαρο-φάγος</foreign> (“Xander-devourer”), that Alexander changed it to <foreign lang="greek">Ἀκεσίνης</foreign> (“The Healing”), with a bright play on its older name Asiknī. <foreign lang="greek">Σανδαροφάγος ὑπὸ Ἀλεξάνδρου ποταμὸς μετωνομάσθη καὶ ἐκλήθη Ἀκεσίνης</foreign>, says Hesychius.</p>
 <p>The names of the Ganges and its greatest tributary, the Jumna, are easily recognized in their ancient forms—<foreign lang="greek">Γάγγης</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Διάμουνα</foreign>; Sanskrit, <title>Gangā</title> and <title>Yamunā.</title> The mountain names <foreign lang="greek">Ἠμωδό-ς</foreign> (Strabo, 689) and <title>Haemodes</title> (<bibl n="Mela  1. 81" default="NO" valid="yes">Mela, i. 81</bibl>) correspond closely to the vernacular form of the Sanskrit <title>Haimavata-s</title>, synonymous with <title>Hima-vant</title>, “The Snow-y” range, and with <title>Hima-ālaya</title>, “Abode of Snow.” The Hindu, in telling the points of the compass, faces the east. The Sanskrit name for Peninsular India, south of the Vindhya Mountains (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ Οὐίνδιον ὄρος</foreign>) is, accordingly, <title>Dakshinā-patha</title>, “Region to the right (<foreign lang="greek">δεξιά</foreign>) or the south,” <foreign lang="greek">Δαχιναβάδης</foreign> of the Periplus ( 50), our Dekkan.</p>
 <p>The recent science of Comparative Grammar has proved that the ancestors of Hindus and Iranians and Greeks and of the Slavic, Germanic, Italic, and Keltic races are of one stock, called Aryan or IndoEuropean, which once had a common language and home. The Indic branch of this stock were not the aboriginal inhabitants of India; these were the dark-skinned tribes or <title>Dasyus</title>, whom the more gifted Aryan invaders, entering India from the extreme northwest, forced constantly to retire to the east and southeast. These non-Aryan tribes are now represented in part by the Dravidian races of the Dekkan. Of the Aryans, numerous tribes are mentioned in the Vedic literature, among them the <title>Pūrus</title>, the <title>Bharatas</title>, the <title>Kuru-Panchālas;</title> but the physical form of the Indo-Gangetic plain, free as it is from mountain barriers, is not favourable to the maintenance of tribal identity, and the floods of foreign invasion have had a similarly unfavourable tendency.</p>
 <p>The language of the Indic Aryans shows three principal stages of development: (1) Old Indic or Sanskrit;</p>
 <p>(2) Middle Indic or Prākrit; and</p>
 <p>(3) New Indic or Bhāshā. The first is represented by the Vedic, the Epic, and the Classical Sanskrit; the second, chiefly by the Pāli and by the Prākrit proper, or languages respectively of the sacred books of the Southern Buddhists and of the Jains; the third, chiefly by the nine principal Aryan tongues of modern India, Mahratti, Bengali, etc.</p>
 <p>Of all these, as indeed of all recorded Aryan tongues, the language of the Vedas is the most ancient; and it has, on the whole, conserved the greatest number of antique features. Note, for example, the retention in Sanskrit of the primitive sibilant in <foreign lang="sanskrit">sU-s</foreign> as compared with the cognate <foreign lang="greek">ὗ-ς</foreign> and English <hi rend="italic">sow;</hi> in <foreign lang="sanskrit">ja/nas-as</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">γένε</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>)-<foreign lang="greek">ος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">gener-is;</seg> in <foreign lang="sanskrit">a/s-mi</foreign>, “I am” = Lesbian <foreign lang="greek">ἔμ-μι</foreign>; in <foreign lang="sanskrit">a/-srava-t</foreign>, “it flowed” = <foreign lang="greek">ἔρρεε</foreign>, for <hi rend="superscript">*</hi><foreign lang="greek">ἔ-σρεϝε-τ</foreign>, root <hi rend="italic">sru=h</hi><foreign lang="greek">ρυ</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The structure of the Sanskrit forms of derivation and inflection is so transparent as to shed much light on the corresponding forms of the allied <cb /> languages. Thus it has two equivalent endings for the passive participle, -<foreign lang="sanskrit">na-s</foreign> and -<foreign lang="sanskrit">ta-s</foreign>; and likewise a root <foreign lang="sanskrit">mah</foreign>, “Be great,” with an older form, <foreign lang="sanskrit">magh</foreign> — facts which, considered together, furnish an easy bond of connection for <foreign lang="greek">μέγ-α</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">māg-nu-s</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">māc-tu-s</foreign>, “Magnified.” In <foreign lang="sanskrit">ichAmi dA-tu-m</foreign>, “I wish to give,” the infinitive is simply the accusative of a verbal noun-stem <foreign lang="sanskrit">dA-tu</foreign>, of which various other case-forms occur. Such facts make clear the nature of the Latin supines: <seg lang="la">īre datum</seg>, “Be going to give;” <seg lang="la">lepida memorātuī</seg>, “Nice for telling, nice to tell;” <seg lang="la">redīre opsōnātu</seg>, “Come back from marketing.” Take <seg lang="la">quo-d</seg> and <foreign lang="greek">πό-θεν</foreign> by themselves, and the stem is obscure; but in the light of the Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">ka-d</foreign>, Gothic <hi rend="italic">hva</hi>, English <hi rend="italic">wha-t</hi>, Ionic <foreign lang="greek">κό-θεν</foreign>, it is plain that the pronominal stem began originally with the <hi rend="italic">k</hi>-sound, not with the <hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
 <p>An extensive Sanskrit literature has come down to us from the Hindus. Oldest and most important are the four Vedas, chiefly metrical. The Rigveda is a collection of over a thousand hymns, the most ancient of which may antedate our era by twenty centuries, and are therefore the oldest recorded documents of Aryan antiquity. Next come the Brahmanas, in prose, and containing, besides mystical discussions of the sacrifice and ritual, those theosophic speculations which culminated in the doctrines of the Upanishads, and thus became the basis of the later philosophical systems, notably of the pantheistic system of the Vedanta. In another stream from the Vedas flow the books of ceremonial, of custom, and of law. The legends of the Heroic Age are embodied in the vast epic called the Great Bharata Story (<title>Mahā-bhārataākhyāna</title>, or, more briefly, the Mahā-bhārata); and also in the lesser epic called Rāmāyana. Notable, besides, are especially the drama (Kālidāsa's Çakuntalā) and the beast-fable (Pancha-tantra).</p>
 <p>The Pāli literature embraces the legends of the life and teachings of Buddha, the books of the doctrine and order which grew therefrom, and the great collection of charming folk-stories called the Jātaka, or tales of the anterior births of Gotama Buddha.</p>
 <p>The early Indic Aryans of the Punjab were a sturdy, life-loving race. Their religion was a primitive polytheism, whose deities were personifications of the phenomena of nature, such as the wind and the sun. Thus <seg lang="la">agnis</seg> was the element (Latin <seg lang="la">ignis</seg>), while <title>Agnis</title> was the fire-god, who bore aloft the sacrifice to the other gods. To Hindu, as to Greek and Roman, the sky (<hi rend="italic">dyaus</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">Ζεύς</foreign>, <title>Diēs-piter</title>) was father and the earth was mother. As the Aryans advanced southeastward down the Ganges valley, the hot and humid climate wrought a profound change in their character. Their religion degenerated into a most elaborate and souldeadening ritualism. The growth of individuality and so of great and public-spirited personalities was estopped by the rigid system of caste. The belief in the transmigration of souls became general. And the institutions of monkish life and asceticism developed to a degree which astonished the Greeks beyond measure, and is perhaps without a parallel elsewhere. Religious nostrums were doubtless many in the “Middle Country” in the sixth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c.;</hi> and so were the religious teachers or saviours, each with his following greater or less. Of all the latter, only two have left any great mark in the world's history—namely, Nātaputta the Nigantha and the great monk Gotama. 
<pb n="875" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Nātaputta was contemporary with Gotama, but somewhat older; and he was the reformer of Jainism, or the religion of the “Conqueror” (<title>Jina</title>), which, since it still flourishes in India, may not unfairly be deemed the oldest Aryan sect in the world. Gotama, whose death at the age of eighty may be set at about B.C. 480, seems to be the greatest personality that India has ever produced. He taught not only a pure and gentle and noble morality, but also that all things are transitory, are misery, are unreal; and that the supreme goal is escape from the bonds of existence and rebirth. His religion, vastly modified by influences of time and locality, has spread to the Extreme Orient; and has meanwhile become displaced in India by Hinduism and the worship of the gods Vishnu and Çiva.</p>
 <p>The customs of the ancient Hindus may be learned with much fulness from the treatises of household usages called <title>Grihya-sūtras;</title> and, when studied in the light of the corresponding classical or Germanic customs, will form a most important and interesting chapter of Aryan comparative philology. Since birth, reproduction, and death are the three great facts of human existence, the marriage and funeral customs naturally take a prominent place in these pictures of ancient life. The joining of right hands was the most significant feature of the nuptial ceremonies; and this was not lacking with the Romans (<seg lang="la">dextrarum iunctio</seg>). The walking about the altar with the right side towards it (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδέξια</foreign>), or the sunwise circumambulation, finds its analogies among other Aryan races: compare the Roman <seg lang="la">dextratio</seg> and the Gaelic “walking the deasil.” The <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> and the <seg lang="la">pellis lanata</seg> may be traced to India. At a funeral the circumambulation was reversed, in Italy (Statius, <bibl n="Stat.  Theb. 6. 215" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Theb.</title>vi. 215</bibl>) as well as on the Ganges. The above may serve as examples of coincidences of usage. It is likely that a considerable body of these customs go back to Aryan antiquity.</p>
 <p>Ancient India has no history, in the ordinary acceptation of the word. If all things are transitory, are misery—why fix the thoughts on them? The events of its past do not show the working of noble and mighty personalities. Its loftiest souls are absorbed in religious and philosophical speculation. The history of India is a history of thought, of religion. The Vedas and the Epics yield us abundant and invaluable evidence concerning the life and civilization of the times to which they belong; but for any records of events in orderly sequence and with fixed chronology we look in vain.</p>
 <p>Yet two great events—the appearance of Buddha and the invasion of Alexander—are exceptions. The one was of profoundest importance to India; the other, of great importance for our knowledge of India. Indeed, it is to foreign invaders and pilgrims that we owe some of our most valuable knowledge about India. Darius (521- 485), on an inscription at Persepolis, mentions the Indus region among his conquered provinces. Nearly two centuries later, B.C. 326, Alexander the Great crossed the Indus (Arrian, <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 5. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>v. 4</bibl>) and the Hydaspes (v. 12); and, after defeating the Indian king Porus (v. 17), advanced to the Hyphasis. On the bank of this Indian stream the worldconqueror was forced to turn back; and, without even entering the Gangetic plain, he set out for Persis. <cb /></p>
 <p>After his death (June, 323), one of his great generals, Seleucus Nicator, invaded India again (about 305), and made a treaty with the famous Sandrokottos (or <foreign lang="greek">Σανδρόκυπτος</foreign>, Sanskrit <title>Chandra-gupta</title>), the founder of the Mauryan dynasty of Magadha. The Magadhan empire extended from Lower Bengal to the Indus, and its capital was <foreign lang="greek">Παλίβοθρα</foreign> (Sanskrit <title>Pātaliputra</title>), on the Ganges at the old confluence of the Sone. The Pāli books call him Chandagutta the Moriya (<foreign lang="greek">Μωριεύς</foreign>); and there is no other ancient Hindu about whom there is so much concurrent evidence from Indian and classical sources. (See Justin, xv. 4.) It was to his court that Seleucus sent his friend Megasthenes as ambassador. Megasthenes was a careful observer, and had a most unusual opportunity for observing; so that the book which he wrote was probably the most valuable work of antiquity on India. As if to show how deplorable is its loss, considerable excerpts from it have been preserved by Strabo, Arrian, and others.</p>
 <p>Chandragupta's grandson Açoka (B.C. 259-222) was the greatest monarch of ancient India. Many rock-inscriptions containing his edicts are still extant, and are of priceless worth, as being the oldest of their kind. Some of them are especially interesting because they mention the Greeks, for example, “Antiyoka, king of the Yonas,” and “Antikina.” The former is Antiochus II., and the latter Antigonus Gonatas. The Yonas or Yavanas are of course the <foreign lang="greek">Ἴωνες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Ἰάονες</foreign>, that is, the Greeks. The rock-cut edicts are found in Orissa, Gujarat, and the extreme north of the Punjab—places so wide apart as to show that Açoka's empire embraced the whole Indo-Gangetic region. Perhaps the most notable event of his reign was his conversion to Buddhism. He was mild and tolerant, but zealous withal for the promotion of the faith. See Senart's “Un roi de l'Inde,” in the <title>Revue des Deux Mondes</title>, March 1, 1889.</p>
 <p>The century from B.C. 326 to 222, accordingly— including, as it does, Alexander's invasion and death, the reigns of Chandragupta and Açoka, and the culmination of the Magadhan empire—is the most notable one of Indian antiquity. It includes also the rise of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom, from which Hellenic kings made repeated conquests of parts of Western India. There followed the GraecoIndian sovereigns, chief of whom was Menander (Pāli <title>Milinda</title>), about B.C. 100. Some fifteen years later the dynasty was overthrown by the Çakas or Scythians, and the power of the Greeks put to an end. The greatest of the Çaka kings was Kanishka; and it is probably his consecration in A.D. 78 that forms the starting-point of the Çaka era, which is still in use.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Gupta dynasty, beginning A.D. 320 and lasting till about 480, deserves mention as bearing a national Indian character. It gave to India a respite from the inroads of the northern barbarians and an excellent administration of government. Among regents of the sixth century, Harsha of Ujjain, with the title Vikramāditya, is famous because of the traditional connection of his name with that of the greatest of all Hindu poets, Kālidāsa. In the seventh century, Çīlāditya of Kanauj became very powerful; and it was during his long reign that the illustrious Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hiuen Tsiang, made his travels in India (A.D. 629-645). The history of modern India begins with the invasion made by Mahmud of 
<pb n="876" /><cb /> Ghazni, A.D. 1000, and embraces the period of the Mohammedan conquerors and that of British rule.</p>

 <p> The Latin term for an official collection of forms of prayer belonging to the <seg lang="la">libri pontificii.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspontifex">Pontifex</ref>). In them were set forth the various powers of each god who was to be summoned to aid in particular cases; and none of these divinities could be passed over, if the prayer was to receive a favourable answer. Only those portions of the collection were made public which bore direct reference to private life; prayers at marriages, at births, for a blessing on the children at different times of life, and for the beginning of all kinds of work, especially agriculture. The <cb /> names of the gods of earliest childhood were as follows: Potina and Educa, who taught the child when weaned to eat and drink; Cuba, who protected the child when taken out of the cradle and put to bed; Ossipaga, who strengthened the bones; Carna, who strengthened the flesh; Levana, who helped it to rise from the ground; Statanus, Statilinus, or Dea Statina, who taught it to stand; Abeona and Adeona, who supported its first walking; Fabulinus, Farinus, who assisted it to talk. All collective occupations, all parts of the house, all different spots had their particular gods, who were invoked in these forms of prayer. Often the various names only indicate the different characteristics of a single divinity—e. g. Maia was invoked under the names of Bona, Fauna, Ops, and Fatua. In course of time the different attributes came to be regarded as separate divinities. The names of these divinities are quoted from Varro's <title>Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum</title> by Tertullian <title>Ad Nat.</title> ii. 11, 15; <title>De Anima</title>, 37, 39; and by Augustine, <title>De Civitate Dei</title>, iv. 11, 21; iv. 8, 10; vi. 9; vii. 23.

 <p>(2) <title>Russian</title> (Bulgarian, Servian, Croatian, Czechish, and Polish).</p>
 <p>Comparative philologists have long speculated over the probable separation and development of these different languages. Two main theories have been put forward. The older is that known as the Genealogical Theory, best stated by Schleicher, but now generally abandoned. According to this view there was a parent-language (<title>Ursprache</title>) spoken by a single people dwelling together in the original home of the race. From these “there hived off swarms which, on geographical disjunction, began to develop differences in language that separated them from the other members of their stock—swarms, however, which still comprised two or three more peoples that for a long period were linguistically one.” Hence were assumed an Italo-Graeco-Keltic period, a Graeco-Latin period, and a Lithu-Slavo-Teutonic period, to account for special points of agreement observed between certain members of the family—e. g. Latin and Greek, Latin and Keltic, etc. The relation between the divisions of the Indo-European language according to the genealogical theory is shown in the following table based upon Schleicher.</p>
 <p>At the present time, the Wave Theory or Transi<figure id="fig.00877">
<head orig="Plan illustrating Schleicher's Genealogical Theory.">Plan illustrating Schleicher's Genealogical Theory.</head>
</figure> tion Theory of Johannes Schmidt, which has the support of Brugmann, Paul, and Schrader, has supplanted the genealogical theory, as it presents fewer difficulties and contradictions when tested by known facts. According to Schmidt, the primitive Indo-European peoples were strictly homogeneous, not packed closely together into a limited territory, <cb /> but settled at considerable distances though with facility of intercourse. Thus differences of dialect would be evolved and accentuated in many parts of the whole territory, and, having been so evolved, spread in waves or undulations over the immediate neighbourhood. Adjacent peoples partook of one another's linguistic peculiarities, and neighbouring dialects borrowed from one another, while those widely separated had no close mutual connection, but became more and more unlike. The relation of different languages is thus explained partly by geographical as well as by genealogical conditions. This can be illustrated in the special group of Greek dialects in later times. In Attic, Boeotian, and Euboean Greek alone an original <foreign lang="greek">τι</foreign> became <foreign lang="greek">ττ</foreign>, because Attica, Boeotia, and Euboea are geographically contiguous; and so, in later Laconian, <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign> is changed to <foreign lang="greek">ρ</foreign> (Rhotacism) by the influence of the usage of Elis, the neighbour of Laconia. There are, in fact, three kinds of resemblances to be noted in the Indo-European tongues—resemblances inherited from the original tongue, resemblances due to long-continued geographical proximity, and resemblances that come from accidental contact with different neighbours at different points, perhaps during a gradual migration from place to place. This last is important, for it will account for the fact that languages which have no especial closeness of relation often exhibit curious special coincidences. Thus, as noted above, Armenian agrees with its European rather than with its Asiatic congeners in possessing <seg lang="la">e</seg>; Sanskrit and Letto-Slavonic assibilate the palatal guttural; Latin and Keltic alone have <hi rend="italic">r</hi> as a passive sign.</p>
 <p>It is not possible to say that any one of the existing Aryan languages has a predominance of archaic traits; and attempts to reconstruct the 
<pb n="878" /><cb />
 primitive tongue from comparative evidence are always unsatisfactory and frequently fanciful. As to the early home of the race before its separation and dispersion, several theories have been held. The old view placed it in Asia among the mountains of the Hindu-Kush (Max Müller). Other suppositions have been vigorously urged. Latham argues that the whole people must have dwelt where the majority of its parts are now found— i. e. in Europe. Benfey supported the same conclusion, arguing from the absence of common names for beasts of prey, and fixed upon the country north of the Black Sea. Geiger and Cuno urge the claims of Germany; Pösche holds to Western Russia; Penka, appealing to craniology, declares Scandinavia to have been the original home; Schrader defends a site partly European and partly Asiatic. The first is the territory bounded on the south by the Danube and the Black Sea, on the west by the Carpathian Mountains, on the east by the Dnieper, and on the north by the forests and swamps of Volhynia. This he regards as the seat of the common European culture, and for the common Indo-Iranian development he selects ancient Sogdiana and Bactriana.</p>

<head orig="Indus">Indus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰνδός</foreign>; Skt. <title>Sindhu</title>). (1) A river of India frequently mentioned in the classics. It rises in Thibet, and after taking a northwesterly course, turns to the south and finally empties into the Indian Ocean. Its total length is something more than 1800 miles, and the area of its drainage-basin 372,000 square miles. At a distance of 812 miles from its source it receives the waters of the five streams of the Punjab—Hydaspes, Acesines, Hydrastes, Hyphasis, and Xeradrus. These all unite and flow into the Indus through the single channel of the Panjnad, a fact maintained by Ptolemy but long disbelieved. The delta of the Indus covers an area of some 3000 square miles.</p>
 <p>(2) A river of Asia Minor rising in the southwestern part of Phrygia and emptying into the Mediterranean opposite Rhodes.

<head orig="Iniuria">Iniuria</head>

 <p> In general, iniuria is whatever is not <seg lang="la">ius;</seg> hence a violation of law. In a special sense, it denotes a wrong against one's person as distinguished 
<pb n="879" /><cb /> from a wrong against one's property. It involves an insult (<foreign lang="greek">ὕβρις</foreign>, <seg lang="la">contumelia</seg>) and must include an intent to act unlawfully (<seg lang="la">dolus</seg>). Instances of iniuria are assault, noisy abuse (<seg lang="la">convicium</seg>), libellous writings, insulting gestures, spitting at a man ( <title>Ad Q. Fratr.</title> ii. 3, 2), dunning him for a debt in such a way as to injure his credit, etc. Iniuria to a wife was also iniuria to her husband. No iniuria could be done to a slave, though iniuria to his master might be done upon the person of a slave. See <ref type="cross" target="crossservus">Servus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The penalty of twenty-five <seg lang="la">asses</seg>, which was provided by the Twelve Tables for iniuria, was subsequently found insufficient in many cases, and so an action was established by the praetor (<seg lang="la">actio iniuriarum aestimatoria</seg>), in which the injured party was allowed to claim such damages as he thought he was entitled to, and the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> might give the full amount or less. This became the ordinary remedy on account of iniuria, but a Lex Cornelia gave a special action in cases of <seg lang="la">pulsatio, verberatio</seg>, and forcible entry into a man's house. The person who committed the iniuria was styled <seg lang="la">iniurius</seg> and later <seg lang="la">iniustus.</seg>

Ino was worshipped at Leucothea, and Melicertes as Palaemon. They were regarded as divinities who aided men in peril on the sea.

 <p> (1) The Latin term for the interference of a higher officer with some public act on the part of one lower in rank—e. g. calling a meeting of the commons. The tribune of the people could thus interfere with the praetor, quaestor, and aedile, so that it was even open to the tribunes of the people to refuse a triumph to a consul or a praetor.</p>
 <p>(2) The quashing of an official act. As in (1), this might be issued by a higher official against a lower one; and also by one colleague against another—e. g. by tribune against tribune. It was necessary that the intercessio should be <cb /> made in person, and in general immediately after the act in question. It was employed against judicial decisions, administrative ordinances (solely on the appeal of the person concerned); also against decrees of the Senate and motions in the popular assembly. The later species of intercessio early became a special right of the <seg lang="la">tribuni</seg> (q. v.).</p>
 <p>(3) In general legal procedure, intercessio means the assumption by one person of another's debt. To become an <seg lang="la">intercessor</seg>, he must incur liability by entering into a contract or other similar transaction with the other person's creditors. See Gaius, iii. 110-127, ed. Poste.

 <p> The intervention by the praetor or proconsul in certain legal controversies to command the abstention from some act—e. g. to forbid the disturbance of some possessions or the desecration of consecrated ground. An order requiring the performance of some act is called <seg lang="la">decretum.</seg> Orders of restitution are styled <seg lang="la">restitutoria;</seg> of production, <seg lang="la">exhibitoria;</seg> of abstention, <seg lang="la">prohibitoria.</seg> (Cf. Gaius, iv. 139, 140, with Poste's note.) The interdict probably arose in cases where there was no statutory action, but where the intervention of the supreme authority was necessary to maintain law and order. In later times, the praetor ceased to intervene absolutely, but made his action conditional, referring the case to a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> and directing the interested parties to stake a wager (<seg lang="la">sponsio</seg>) on the question at issue.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰώ</foreign>). The beautiful daughter of Inachus, and the first priestess of Heré at Argos. As Zeus loved her, she was changed by the jealousy of Heré into a white heifer, and Argus of the hundred eyes was appointed to watch her. When Hermes, at the command of Zeus, had killed Argus, Heré maddened the heifer by sending a gad-fly which perpetually pursued her. Io thus wandered through the continents of Europe and Asia, by land and by sea. Each of the different straits she swam across was named after her Bosporus, or Ox-ford. At last in Egypt she recovered her original shape, and bore Epaphus to Zeus. Libya, the daughter of Epaphus, became by Poseidon the mother of Belus, who in turn was father of Aegyptus, Danaus, Cepheus, and Phineus. The Greek legend of Io's going to Egypt is probably to be explained by her having been identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis, who is always represented with cow's horns. Io (“the wanderer”) is generally explained as a moon-goddess wandering in the starry heavens, symbolized by Argus of the hundred eyes; her transformation into a horned heifer representing the crescent moon.

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Jan Everard</hi>). A Dutch artist and scholar, justly celebrated for his Latin verse. He was born at the Hague, November 11, 1511, and died at Utrecht, September 24, 1536. He won some success for his painting and sculpture, and was one of the suite of Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis. His Latin verses are written with classical purity and show an exquisite felicity of expression, which has led to their translation and imitation in many languages. The finest is the <title>Basia</title> (“Kisses”), published at Utrecht in 1539. It consists of separate poems, each descriptive of a kiss. The grace and melody of the lines and their voluptuous warmth of feeling have led them to be compared with the love-lyrics of Catullus, and the comparison is fully justified. There is a translation in prose and verse, with notes, in the Bohn series <bibl default="NO">(London, 1858)</bibl>. The collected works of Everard, comprising elegies, odes, and epigrams, were published under the title <title>Opera Poetica</title> by his brothers at Paris in 1541, and have since been reprinted <bibl default="NO">(Göttingen, 1748; Leyden, 1821)</bibl>.

<head orig="Ion">Ion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴων</foreign>). (1) According to the Attic story, the son of Apollo and Creüsa, daughter of the Athenian king Erechtheus. He was exposed at his birth by his mother in a grotto on the cliff of the Acropolis, whence he was taken by Hermes to Delphi and brought up by the Pythian priestess to be an attendant in his father's temple. Creüsa afterwards married Xuthus, who had migrated from Thessaly, and was son of Hellen and brother of Aeolus and Dorus. As this marriage was childless, the pair went to Delphi to consult the god as to the cause. Xuthus received the command to consider as his son the first person he should meet in front of the temple. This happened to be Ion, who had meanwhile grown up, and was at once accepted by Xuthus as his son. But Creüsa, fancying he was her husband's son by a former union, resolved to poison him. Ion detected her design in time and would have killed Creüsa, who, however, took refuge at the altar of the god. Then the Pythian priestess produced the cradle in which he had been exposed as an infant, and thus brought about recognition and reconciliation between mother and son. Ion married Helicé, the daughter of Selinus, king of the Aegialeans on the north coast of the Peloponnesus. At the death of this king he became monarch of the land, and the inhabitants assumed the name of Ionians after him. Afterwards being called upon by the Athenians to help them against Eumolpus and the Eleusinians, he conquered the enemy and was made king of Athens. From the four sons who are attributed to him, Geleon, Aegicores, Argades, and Hoples, were descended the four Ionic tribes.</p>
 <p>(2) Of Chios. A Greek author of rare versatility for his time. He composed historical writings, among them a kind of memoirs of men of mark he had met, such as Sophocles; also lyric poems of the most varied types, and thirty or forty tragedies which were more remarkable for elegance and erudition than for elevation of style. When in B.C. 452 he won a dramatic victory at Athens, he is said to have presented every Athenian with a flask of Chian wine. He died at Athens in B.C. 422. There remain only scanty fragments of his works.

<div2 id="crossiones" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Iōnes">Iones</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴωνες</foreign>). Ionians; one of the two great original divisions of the Hellenic race, the other being the Doric. Their ancestors at an early period spread over the coasts of Asia Minor, and there established a people of great commercial and intellectual activity, while the ancestors of the Dorians settled in the highlands of Northern Greece. In Asia the Ionians came into close contact with the Semitic peoples, especially at Miletus, and from them received an impulse towards civilization which they in turn imparted to their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegaean. Their name (under the form <foreign lang="greek">Ἰάονες</foreign>) occurs only once in <cb /> the <title>Iliad</title> (xiii. 685), but not long after this we find them in Attica and in a part of the Peloponnesus. Their name was by them derived from that of the mythical Ion, adopted son of Xuthus (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 44</bibl>).

<head orig="Ionia">Ionia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰωνία</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Iōnis</hi> (in Latin poetry). A district on the west coast of Asia Minor, so called from the Ionian Greeks who colonized it earlier than any distinct historical records. The mythical account of “the great Ionic migration” relates that in consequence of the disputes between the sons of Codrus, king of Athens, about the succession to his government, his younger sons, Neleus and Androclus, resolved to seek a new home beyond the Aegean Sea. Attica was at the time overpeopled by numerous exiles, whom the great revolution, known as “the return of the Heraclidae,” had driven out of their own States, and the chief of whom were the Ionians who had been expelled from Peloponnesus by the Dorian invaders. A large portion of this superfluous population went forth as Athenian colonists, under the leadership of Androclus and Neleus, and of other chieftains of other races, and settled on that part of the western shores of Asia Minor which formed the coast of Lydia and part of Caria, and also in the adjacent islands of Chios and Samos, and in the Cyclades. The mythical chronology places this great movement 140 years after the Trojan War, or 60 years after the return of the Heraclidae—that is, in B.C. 1060 or 1044, according to the two chief dates imagined for the Trojan War.</p>
 <p>Passing from mythology to history, the earliest authentic records show us the existence of twelve great cities on the above-named coast, claiming to be (though some of them only partially) of Ionic origin, and all united into one confederacy, similar to that of the twelve ancient Ionian cities on the north coast of the Peloponnesus. The district they possessed formed a narrow strip of coast, extending between, and somewhat beyond, the mouths of the rivers Maeander on the south, and Hermus on the north. The names of the twelve cities, going from south to north, were Miletus, Myus, Priené, Samos (city and island), Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Erythrae, Chios (city and island), Clazomenae, and Phocaea; the first three on the coast of Caria, the rest on that of Lydia. The city of Smyrna, which lay within this district, but was of Aeolic origin, was afterwards (about B.C. 700) added to the Ionian confederacy. The common sanctuary of the league was the Panionium (<foreign lang="greek">πανιώνιον</foreign>), a sanctuary of Poseidon Heliconius, on the north side of the promontory of Mycalé, opposite to Samos; and here was held the great national assembly (<foreign lang="greek">πανήγυρις</foreign>) of the confederacy, called Panionia (<foreign lang="greek">πανιώνια</foreign>). It is important to observe that the inhabitants of these cities were far from being exclusively and purely of Ionic descent. The traditions of the original colonization and the accounts of the historians agree in representing them as peopled by a mixture, not only of Hellenic races, but also of these with the earlier inhabitants, such as Carians, Leleges, Lydians, Cretans, and Pelasgians; their dialects, Herodotus expressly tells us, were very different, and nearly all the cities were founded on the sites of pre-existing native settlements. The religious rites, also, which 
<pb n="883" /><cb />
 the Greeks of Ionia observed, in addition to their national worship of Poseidon, were borrowed in part from the native peoples; such were the worship of Apollo Didymaeus at Branchidae near Miletus, of Artemis at Ephesus, and of Apollo Clarius at Colophon. All these facts point to the conclusion that the Greek colonization of this coast was effected, not by one, but by successive emigrations from different States, but chiefly of the Ionic race.</p>
 <p>The central position of this district, its excellent harbours, and the fertility of its plains, watered by the Maeander, the Caÿster, and the Hermus, combined with the energetic character of the Ionian race to confer a high degree of prosperity upon these cities; and it was not long before they began to send forth colonies to many places on the shores of the Mediterranean and the Euxine, and even to Greece itself. During the rise of the Lydian Empire, the cities of Ionia preserved their independence until the reign of Croesus, who subdued those on the mainland, but relinquished his design of attacking the islands. When Cyrus had overthrown Croesus, he sent his general, Harpagus, to complete the conquest of the Ionian Greeks, B.C. 557. Under the Persian rule, they retained their political organization, subject to the government of the Persian satraps, and of tyrants who were set up in single cities, but they were required to render tribute and military service to the king. In B.C. 500 they revolted from Darius Hystaspis, under the leadership of Histiaeus, the former tyrant of Miletus, and his brother-in-law Aristagoras, and supported by aid from the Athenians. The Ionian army advanced as far as Sardis, which they took and burned; but they were driven back to the coast, and defeated near Ephesus, B.C. 499. The reconquest of Ionia by the Persians was completed by the taking of Miletus, in 496, and the Ionians were compelled to furnish ships and to serve as soldiers, in the two expeditions against Greece. After the defeat of Xerxes, the Greeks carried the war to the coasts of Asia, and effected the liberation of Ionia by the victories of Mycalé (479), and of the Eurymedon (469). In 387 the peace of Antalcidas restored Ionia to Persia; and after the Macedonian conquest, it formed part, successively, of the kingdom of Pergamus and of the Roman province of Asia. For the history of the several cities, see the respective articles.</p>
 <p>In no country inhabited by the Hellenic race, except at Athens, were the refinements of civilization, the arts, and literature more highly cultivated than in Ionia. The restless energy and free spirit of the Ionians, the riches gained by commerce, and the neighbourhood of the great seats of Asiatic civilization, combined to advance with rapidity the intellectual progress and the social development of its people; but these same influences, unchecked by the rigid discipline of the Doric race, or the simple earnestness of the Aeolic, imbued their social life with luxury and license, and invested their works of genius with enchanting beauty at the expense of severe good taste and earnest purpose. Out of the long list of the authors and artists of Ionia, we may mention Mimnermus of Colophon, the first poet of the amatory elegy; Anacreon of Teos, who sang of love and wine to the music of the lyre; Thales of Miletus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, and several other early philosophers; the early annalists, Cadmus, Dionysius, and Hecataeus, all of Miletus. In the fine arts, besides being <cb /> the home of that exquisitely beautiful order of architecture, the Ionic, and possessing many of the most magnificent temples in the world, Ionia was the native country of that refined school of painting, which boasted the names of Zeuxis, Apelles, and Parrhasius. The most flourishing period in the history of Ionia is that during which it was subject to Persia; but its prosperity lasted till the decline of the Roman Empire, under which its cities were among the chief resorts of the celebrated teachers of rhetoric and philosophy. The important place which some of the chief cities of Ionia occupy in the early history of Christianity is attested by the Acts of the Apostles, and the epistles of St. Paul to the Ephesians, and of St. John to the seven churches of Asia.

The sea between Italy and Greece south of the Adriatic, beginning on the west at Hydruntum in Calabria, and on the east at Oricus in Epirus, or at the Ceraunian Mountains.

In its widest signification the Ionium Maré included the Maré Siculum, Creticum, and Icarium. Its name was usually derived by the ancients from the wanderings of Io, but it was more probably so called from the Ionian colonies which settled in Cephallenia and the other islands off the western coasts of Greece.

<head orig="Iosēphus">Iosephus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossflavius">Flavius</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Φλάβιος Ἰώσηπος</foreign>). A celebrated Jewish historian, born at Jerusalem in A.D. 37, inheriting on his father's side the priestly office and being descended through his mother from the Asmonaean princes. After receiving an excellent education, he was sent to Rome at the age of twenty-six to plead before Nero the cause of several Jewish priests whom the procurator Felix had sent there as prisoners. After securing their release, he returned to Jerusalem, which he found on the eve of a revolt against the Romans. He endeavoured to dissuade his countrymen from the attempt, but failing in this, he entered into their plans and took the field as one of their generals. On the approach of Vespasian with a Roman army, Iosephus retired with his forces into Iotapata, where, for forty-seven days, he sustained a siege, surrendering, however, in the end. His life was spared by Vespasian through the intercession of Titus. Iosephus thereupon assumed the character of a prophet, and predicted to Vespasian that the Empire should one day be his and his son's. Vespasian treated him with respect, but did not release him from captivity until he was proclaimed emperor nearly three years afterwards (A.D. 70). Iosephus was present with Titus at the siege of Jerusalem, and afterwards accompanied him to Rome. He received the freedom of the city from Vespasian, who assigned him, as a residence, a house formerly occupied by himself, and treated him with great regard to the end of his reign. The same favour was extended to him by Titus and Domitian as well. He assumed the name of Flavius, as a dependant of the Flavian family. His time at Rome appears to have been employed mainly in the composition of his works. He died about A.D. 100.</p>
 <p>The works of Iosephus are written in Greek of such pleasing style as to win for him the title of “the Greek Livy.” They are: (1) A History of the Jewish War (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τοῦ Ἰουδαϊκοῦ πολέμου ἢ Ἰουδαϊκῆς Ἱστορίας περὶ Ἁλώσεως</foreign>), in seven books, published about A.D. 75. Iosephus first wrote it in Hebrew, and then translated it into Greek. It commences with the capture of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes in B.C. 170, runs rapidly over the events before Iosephus's own time, and gives a detailed account of the fatal war with Rome.</p>
 <p>(2) On Jewish Antiquities (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰουδαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία</foreign>), in twenty books, completed about A.D. 93, and addressed to Epaphroditus. <cb /> The title as well as the number of books may have been suggested by the <foreign lang="greek">Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία</foreign> of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. It gives an account of Jewish History from the creation of the world to A.D. 66, in which the Jews were goaded to rebellion by Gessius Florus. In this work Iosephus seeks to reconcile the Jewish religion with heathen tastes and prejudices. Thus he speaks of Moses and his law in a tone which might be adopted by any disbeliever in his divine mission. He says that Abraham went into Egypt (Gen. xii.), intending to adopt the Egyptian views of religion, should he find them better than his own. He speaks doubtfully of the preservation of Jonah by the fish. He intimates a doubt of there having been any miracle in the passage of the Red Sea, and compares it with the passage of Alexander the Great along the shore of the sea of Pamphylia. He interprets Exod. xxii. 28 as if it conveyed a command to respect the idols of the heathen. Many similar instances might be quoted from his work.</p>
 <p>(3) His own life, in one book. This is a supplement to the <title>Archaeologia</title>, and is addressed to the same Epaphroditus. It was not written earlier than A.D. 97, since Agrippa II. is mentioned in it as no longer living.</p>
 <p>(4) A treatise on the Antiquity of the Jews, or against Apion , in two books, also addressed to Epaphroditus. It is in answer to such as impugned the antiquity of the Jewish nation, on the ground of the silence of Greek writers respecting it. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapion">Apion</ref>.) The treatise exhibits extensive acquaintance with Greek literature and philosophy.</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">Εἰς Μακκαβαίους ἢ περὶ Αὐτοκράτορος Λογισμοῦ</foreign>, in one book. Its genuineness is doubtful. It is a declamatory account of the martyrdom of Eleazar (an aged priest), and of seven youths and their mother, in the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes. The best editions of Iosephus are by Hudson <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1720)</bibl>, Havercamp <bibl default="NO">(Amsterdam, 1726)</bibl>, Dindorf <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1845-47)</bibl>, Bekker, 6 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1855- 1856)</bibl>, and Niese (Berlin, 1886 foll.).

<div2 id="crossiovianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">

 <p>A Roman emperor, born A.D. 331, the son of Veronianus, of an illustrious family of Moesia, who had filled important offices under Constantine. Iovianus served in the army of Julian , in his unlucky expedition against the Persians; and when that emperor was killed, A.D. 363, the soldiers proclaimed him successor. His first task was to save the army, which was surrounded by the Persians, and in great distress for provisions. After repelling repeated attacks of the enemy, he willingly listened to proposals for peace, and accepted conditions offensive to Roman pride. Iovianus gave up the city of Nisibis to the Persians, the inhabitants withdrawing to Amida. On his arrival at Antioch, Iovianus, who was of the Christian faith, revoked the edicts of Julian against the Christians. He also supported the orthodox or Nicene creed against the Arians, and showed his favour to the bishops who had previously suffered from the Arians, and especially to Athanasius, who visited him at Having been acknowledged over the whole Empire, Iovianus set off during the winter to Constantinople. At Ancyra he assumed the consular dignity; but, a few days after, being at a place called Dadastana, in Galatia, he was found dead in his bed, having 
<pb n="885" /><cb />
 been suffocated, as some say, by the vapour of charcoal burning in his room; according to others, by the steam of the plaster with which it had been newly laid; while others, again, suspected him of having been poisoned or killed by some of his guards. He died February 16, A.D. 364, after a reign of only seven months. The army proclaimed Valentinianus as his successor (Amm. Marcell. xxv. 5 foll.).

At the head of his targeteers he defeated and nearly destroyed a Spartan mora, in B.C. 392, an exploit which became very celebrated throughout Greece. He also defeated Anaxibius at the Hellespont (388), aided the Persians in subduing Egypt (377), reduced Cephallonia (373), and commanded in the Social War.

<head orig="Iphigenīa">Iphigenia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰφιγένεια</foreign>, in Homer <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφιάνασσα</foreign>). Daughter of Agamemnon and of Clytaemnestra, or (according to another account) of Theseus and Helen (q. v.), and brought up by Clytaemnestra as her own child to hide her sister's shame. When the Greek ships were detained at Aulis by the calm caused by the wrath of Artemis against Agamemnon for killing a hind sacred to that goddess, and boasting that he was superior to her in the chase, the seer Calchas announced that the goddess could be appeased only by the sacrifice of Iphigenia. According to another story, <cb /> Agamemnon had vowed, before the birth of Iphigenia, that he would sacrifice to the goddess whatever the year brought forth that was loveliest, but had neglected to keep his vow. After a long struggle Agamemnon finally gave way to the pressure put upon him by Menelaüs, and sent for his daughter to come to Aulis under the pretext of betrothing her to Achilles. During the sacrifice Artemis substituted a hind for her, and carried her off in a cloud to the land of the Tauri (the modern Crimea), where, as priestess of the goddess, it fell to her lot to offer up as victims all strangers who were shipwrecked on the coast. Orestes, who, <figure id="fig.00885">
<head orig="Sacrifice of Iphigenia. (Pompeian Painting.)">Sacrifice of Iphigenia. (Pompeian Painting.)</head>
</figure> commanded by the oracle, had gone there to bring to Attica the image of the goddess, was on the point of being sacrificed by her, when she recognized him as her brother and allowed herself to be carried off by him together with the image. At Delphi her sister Electra wanted to put her eyes out, on hearing that the Tauric priestess had slain Orestes; but was prevented from doing so by her brother's arrival. She is said to have brought the image of the Tauric Artemis to the Attic deme of Brauron, and to have died and been buried there as its priestess. She was even introduced into Attic legend as daughter of Theseus and Helen. In other places also, such as Sparta, the image was shown, and she was regarded as a priestess who had brought it to Greece from among the Scythians. In all probability Iphigenia was originally a designation of Artemis herself, and out of this epithet of the goddess the personality of the priestess was in time evolved. Her grave was also shown at Megara. According to another legend, she is said to have been made immortal by Artemis, and to have lived on in the island of Leucé as the wife of Achilles under the name of Orsilochia. Two plays of Euripides (<title>Iphigenia at Aulis</title> and <title>Iphigenia among the Tauri</title>) deal with her story.

On the martyrdom of Photinus, his predecessor in the see of Lyons, Irenaeus, who had been a distinguished member of the church in that quarter, was appointed his successor in the diocese, A.D. 177, and presided in that capacity at two councils held at Lyons, in one of which the Gnostic heresy was condemned and in another the Quartodecimani. He also went to Rome, and disputed there publicly with Valentinus, Florinus, and Blastus, against whose opinions he afterwards wrote with much zeal and ability. He wrote on different subjects; but there remains only a barbarous Latin version of a work, <title>Adversus Haereses</title>, in five books, written to confute the Gnostics and Ebionites.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰσίδωρος</foreign>). A Spaniard who, from the beginning of the seventh century, was bishop of Seville (in Latin <title>Hispalis</title>, whence he is called Hispalensis). He died about A.D. 636. He possessed a width of reading which was remarkable for his time, and an extraordinary faculty for collecting information. Next to Boëtius and Cassiodorus, he exercised the most important influence upon the general culture and literature of the Middle Ages. Besides works on grammar, theology, and history (including a chronicle of the world to his own day, and histories of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi), he composed in the last years of his life his greatest and most important work—an immense but imperfect encyclopaedic survey of all knowledge, in twenty books, entitled the <title>Etymologiae</title> or <title>Origines</title>, <cb /> from its often very capricious and marvellous explanations of the various subjects of which it treats. Though it is only a vast congeries of collected excerpts, devoid of a single original idea, it is nevertheless important owing to the variety of its contents and its citations from writings now lost, such as those of Suetonius. Another work, which is similarly a compilation, but was greatly used in the Middle Ages, is his <title>De Natura Rerum</title>, a handbook of natural history.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἶσις</foreign>). The divinity most extensively worshipped, with her brother and husband Osiris, by the Egyptians, among whom she represented the feminine, receptive, and producing principle in nature. As the goddess of procreation and birth her symbol was the cow. On monuments she is mostly represented as of youthful appearance with a cow's horns on her head, between the horns the orb of the moon, and with a sceptre of flowers and the emblem of life in her hands. Her greatest temple stood at Busiris (i. e. Pe-Osiri, or Abode of Osiris) in the midst of the Delta of the Nile, where, amidst the fruitful fields, the inhabitants worshipped the mightiest god and goddess with cere<figure id="fig.00887">

</figure> monies which typified the search and discovery of Osiris by his mourning wife after his murder by Typhon. Like Osiris she was a divinity who ruled over the world below. In the course of the fusion of religions which took place under the Ptolemies, Isis and Osiris were confounded with all manner of Asiatic and Greek gods. In process of time she became in her power the most universal of all goddesses, ruling in heaven, on earth, and on the sea, and in the world below, decreeing life and death, deciding the fate of men, and dispensing rewards and punishments. Her worship spread over Greece, and after the Second Punic War obtained a firm footing in Rome in spite of repeated interference by the State. In the days of the Empire it obtained recognition by the State and established itself in all parts of the Roman dominions. The attractiveness of the service of Isis lay in the religious satisfaction which it was calculated to insure. Through

 abstinence from food and from sensual pleasures, and through expiations and purifications, it promised to lead its votaries to sanctification of life and to a true perception of the life divine. The ritual consisted in part of a morning and evening service to the god, partly in annual festivals celebrated in spring at the return of the season for navigation, and also in the late autumn before the advent of winter. At the former festival, held on the fifth of March, and called the ship of Isis (<title>Isidis navigium</title>), in recognition of her being the patroness of navigation, and inventress of the sail, the people in general, with the devotees and priests of Isis, went in solemn procession down to the seashore, where a sailing-vessel painted in the Egyptian manner and laden with spices, was committed to the sea ( <bibl n="Ov.

 <p>The other feast was emblematic of the grief of Isis at her loss and her joy at finding again her husband Osiris and her son Horus. Besides these popular feasts there were also certain special mysteries of Isis, which in all their essentials were borrowed from the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmysteria">Mysteria</ref>.) In these, all who were called thereto by the goddess in a dream were admitted to the select circle of the worshippers of Isis. These devotees, like the priests, were recognized by their linen robes and their shaven heads, and had to devote themselves to an ascetic life.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰσοκράτης</foreign>). The fourth among the <ref type="cross" target="crossten-attic-orators">ten Attic orators</ref> (q.v.). He was born at Athens in B.C. 436, the son of Theodorus, the wealthy proprietor of a flute manufactory, who provided for his son a thorough education. Accordingly, he had the advantage of being instructed by Prodicus, Protagoras, Theramenes, and above all by Gorgias, his character was also moulded by the influence of Socrates, although he never belonged to the more restricted circle of that philosopher's pupils.</p>
 <p>Bashfulness and a weak voice prevented him from taking part in public life. After the fall of the Thirty, as his father had lost his means in the calamitous years that closed the Peloponnesian War, he turned his attention to composing forensic speeches for others. After having taught rhetoric at Chios (probably about B.C. 404), he returned to Athens in 403, and there opened a regular school of rhetoric about 392. It was largely attended by both Athenians and non-Athenians, and gained for him considerable wealth. The total number of his pupils has been given at one hundred, including Timotheus, son of Conon , the orators Isaeus , Hyperides, and Lycurgus, and the historians Ephorus and Theopompus. Each pupil paid him 1000 drachmae. Isocrates also had friendly relations with foreign princes, especially with Evagoras of Cyprus and his son Nicocles, who loaded him with

 favours. He kept himself completely aloof from any personal share in the public life of his day; yet attempted to influence the political world, not only within the narrow bounds of his native land, but also throughout the whole of Greece, by a series of rhetorical declamations, not intended to be delivered, but only to be read. This he did in the first place in his <title>Panegyricus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πανηγυρικός</foreign>), which he published in B.C. 380, after spending ten or, according to another account, as many as fifteen years over its preparation. It is a kind of festal oration, eulogizing the services of Athens to Greece, exhorting the Spartans peacefully to share the supremacy with Athens, and calling on the Greeks to lay aside all internal dissensions and to attack the barbarians with their united strength. In the ninetieth year of his age, in a discourse addressed to Philip in B.C. 346, he endeavoured to induce that monarch to carry out his policy by reconciling all the Greeks to one another and leading their united forces against the Persians. Other discourses relate to the internal politics of Athens. Thus, in the <title>Areopagiticus</title> (B.C. 354), he recommends his fellow-citizens to get rid of the existing weaknesses in their political constitution by returning to the democracy as founded by Solon and reconstituted by Clisthenes, and by reinstating the Areopagus as the supreme tribunal of censorship over public decorum and morality. He retained his mental and bodily powers unimpaired to an advanced age, and in his ninety-eighth year completed the <title>Panathenaicus</title>, a discourse in praise of Athens. He lived to see the total wreck of all his hopes for a regeneration of Greece, and died B.C. 338, a few days after the battle of Chaeronea. He is said to have <cb /> died of voluntary starvation, owing to his despair at the downfall of Greek liberty; but this account of his death, made familiar to the English world by Milton in his fifth English sonnet, must be considered as doubtful.</p>
 <p>There were sixty compositions bearing his name known to antiquity, but less than half that number were considered genuine. Of the twenty-one which have come down to us, the first, the letter to Dominicus, is often regarded as spurious, but there is no reason to doubt the genuineness of nine of the ten other letters. It is only the letter prefixed to the nine in the older editions that is not genuine, having been really written by Theophylact Simocatta early in the seventh century A.D. Of the speeches, six are forensic orations, written to be delivered by others; the rest are declamations, chiefly on political subjects. By his mastery of style, Isocrates had a far-reaching influence on all subsequent Greek prose, which is not confined to oratorical composition alone. His chief strength lies in a careful choice of expression, not only in his vocabulary, but also in the rhythmical formation of his flowing periods, in a skilful use of the figures of speech, and in all that lends euphony to language. Even in Latin the oratorical prose of Cicero is, on its formal side, based chiefly on that of Isocrates; and as modern literary prose has, in its turn, been largely modelled on that of Cicero, the influence of Isocrates has endured to the present day.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ἴσθμια</foreign>). One of the four great national festivals of the Greeks, held on the Isthmus of Corinth, in a grove of pine-trees sacred to Poseidon, near the shrines of the Isthmian Poseidon and of Melicertes. From B.C. 589, they were held in the first month of spring, in the second and fourth years of each Olympiad. According to legend, the Isthmian Games were originally funeral games in memory of <ref type="cross" target="crossmelicertes">Melicertes</ref> (q.v.); another tradition relates that they were established by Theseus either in honour of Poseidon, or in commemoration of his victory over Sciron and Sinis. <cb /> In any case, the Athenians were specially interested in the festival from the earliest times. It was alleged that, from the days of Theseus downwards, they had what was called the <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>, the right of occupying the most prominent seats at the games, and, in accordance with a law attributed to Solon, they presented to those of their citizens who were victors in the contests a reward amounting to 100 drachmae. The only occasion when Socrates was absent from Athens, except with the army, was to attend this festival. The inhabitants of Elis were completely excluded from the games, being debarred from either sending competitors or festal envoys. The Corinthians had the presidency, which was transferred to the Sicyonians after the destruction of Corinth (B.C. 146), but at the rebuilding of Corinth (B.C. 46) it was restored to that city. The contests included gymnastic exercises, horseraces, and competitions in music. The former two differed in no essential way from the Olympian Games; in the third, besides musicians, poets of either sex contended for the prize. Besides the customary palm, the prize in Pindar's time consisted of a wreath of dry <foreign lang="greek">σέλινον</foreign> (often translated “parsley,” but more probably identical with the “wild celery,” <seg lang="la">apium graveolens</seg>). The <foreign lang="greek">σέλινον</foreign> was a symbol of funeral games. After the destruction of Corinth, a crown of pine needles was substituted for it. The games long continued to be held, even under the Roman Empire. (Cf. Plut. <title>Timoleon</title>, 26; <title>Sympos.</title> v. 3, 1-3).

<pb n="891" /><cb /> Tyrrhenum or Inferum. It was called <ref type="cross" target="crosshesperia">Hesperia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑσπερία</foreign>, “Land of the West”) by the Greeks, from its western situation in relation to Greece ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 530" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>i. 530</bibl>), and received also from the Latin poets the appellation of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ausonia</hi> ( <bibl n="Verg.

The name <ref type="cross" target="crossitalia">Italia</ref> some writers derive from Italus, a chief of the Oenotri or Siculi ( <bibl n="Thuc.  6. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.vi. 2</bibl>). Others find the origin of the term in the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">ἰταλός</foreign>, or the Latin <seg lang="la">vitulus</seg> (Oscan <hi rend="italic">vitlu</hi>), which corresponds to it (Varr. <title>R. R.</title> ii. 5; Dion. Hal. i. 35; and Mommsen, <cb /> <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, i. p. 185). Some make the name to have belonged originally to a small section of Calabria, and to have been gradually applied to the whole country.</p>
 <p>When the Greeks first became acquainted with this country, they observed it to be peopled with several distinct nations, as they thought; and hence we find it divided by them about the time of Aristotle into six regions—Ausonia or Opica, Tyrrhenia, Iapygia, Ombria, Liguria, and Henetia. Thucydides, in speaking of Cumae, says that it is situated in Opica; and Aristotle, cited by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 
<pb n="892" /><cb /> made Latium a part of this same Opica. As regards the original use of the name Italia, the truth appears to be that the appellation was first given by the early Greeks to Calabria Ulterior, or that southern extremity of the boot which is confined between the Sinus Terinaeus and the Sinus Scyllacius. Such, at least, is the account of Aristotle (<title>Polit.</title> vii. 10). This was not done because the name was in strictness confined to that section of the country, but because the Greeks knew at that early period very little, comparatively speaking, of the interior. The nations in the south of Italy, with whom the Greeks first became acquainted, were found by them to be descended from the Itali, or, rather, they found this name in general use among them: hence they called their section of the country by the name of Italia. As their knowledge of the interior became more enlarged, other branches of the same race were successively discovered, and the name Italia thus gradually progressed in its application until it reached the southern limits of Cisalpine Gaul. To this latter country the name of Gallia Cisalpina was originally given, because it was peopled principally by Gauls. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgallia">Gallia</ref>.) Towards the <figure id="fig.00892">
<head orig="Diagram of the Italic Peoples.">Diagram of the Italic Peoples.</head>
</figure> end of the third century B.C., Italia designated all the countries south of the Tiber and Aesis. At length, in Polybius, we find the name given to all Italy up to the foot of the Alps. The inclusion of Cisalpine Gaul under this appellation was an act of policy on the part of the Second Triumvirate, who were afraid lest, if it remained a province, some future proconsul might imitate Caesar, and overthrow with his legions the authority of the Republic. At a still later period, Augustus divided Italy into eleven regions (see below). It is somewhat remarkable that the name Italia, after having gradually extended to the Alps, should at a subsequent epoch be limited in its application to the northern parts alone. When the emperor Maximian, towards the close of the third century A.D., transferred his residence to Milan, the usage prevailed in the West of giving the name of Italy exclusively to the five provinces of Æmilia, Liguria, Flaminia, Venetia, and Istria. It was in this sense that the kings of the Lombards were styled kings of Italy.</p>
 <p>Italy was never inhabited by a single race. It contained a number of different peoples, who had migrated into the country at a very early period. <cb /> They may be classified under the following five divisions:</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Illyrians</hi>.—These were the people usually spoken of as the Veneti, dwelling at the head of the Adriatic (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 196" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 196</bibl>), and regarded by ethnologists as Indo-European and probably allied to the Albanians in their racial type as in their language. Of the speech of these people there exist, in addition to geographical and personal names, several hundred inscriptions, largely dedications on bronzes and pottery, and all of them very brief. Other offshoots of the same branch are probably to be found in the Iapygians of southeastern Italy, of whom the Messapii are the most noted group. Of the last there exist some 165 stone inscriptions. See Pauli, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Veneter</title> (Leipzig, 1891)</bibl>; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmessapia">Messapia</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Etruscans</hi>.—This curious people extended from the mouth of the Tiber between its right bank on the sea to the Alps in the north. For a full account of the theories regarding them, see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossetruria">Etruria</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Greeks</hi>.—Southern Italy was colonized by Greeks at an early period, and there existed in that part of the peninsula (called <ref type="cross" target="crossmagna-graecia">Magna Graecia</ref> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Graecia Maior</hi>) rich and flourishing cities long before Rome had risen to power. Among them were Tarentum, Sybaris, Croton, Siris (Heraclea), Metapontum, Locri, and Rhegium, and their inhabitants exerted considerable influence upon both the purely Italic peoples of Italy and upon the Latin language, contributing to it a number of non-Ionic word-forms. See Lenormant, <title>La Grande-Grèce</title>, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1881)</bibl>.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Kelts</hi>.—These first appeared in Italy only in historic times, in the early years of the fourth century B.C. Keltic inscriptions have been found in Italy as far south as Todi in Umbria. See <ref type="cross" target="crossceltae">Celtae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossgallia-cisalpina">Gallia Cisalpina</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Italians Proper</hi>.—These are the branch of the Indo-European race that became specifically identified with Italy, and of which the Latin subdivision finally dominated the whole peninsula and in fact the known world. Grouped linguistically, there are two principal divisions: <title>(a) LatinFaliscan</title> and <title>(b) Oscan-Umbrian</title> or <title>Umbro-Sabellian.</title> The Oscan-Umbrian is subdivided into many minor dialects, their general relations being sufficiently well indicated in the foregoing diagram; see, also, the separate articles <ref type="cross" target="crossosci">Osci</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossumbria">Umbria</ref>. 
<pb n="893" /><cb /></p>
 <p>At the time of Augustus the following were the chief divisions of Italy, an account of which is also given in separate articles: (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Upper Italy</hi>, which extended from the Alps to the rivers Macra on the west and Rubico on the east. It comprehended (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Liguria; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Gallia Cisalpina; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Venetia, including Carnia; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Istria.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Central Italy</hi>, sometimes called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Italia Propria</hi> (a term not used by the ancients), to distinguish it from Gallia Cisalpina or Upper Italy, and Magna Graecia or Lower Italy, extended from the rivers Macra on the west and Rubico on the east, to the rivers Silarus on the west and Frento on the east. It comprehended (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Etruria; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Umbria; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Picenum; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Samnium, including the country of the Sabini, Vestini, Marrucini, Marsi, Paeligni, etc.; (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) Latium; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Campania.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lower Italy</hi>, or <ref type="cross" target="crossmagna-graecia">Magna Graecia</ref>, included the remaining part of the peninsula, south of the rivers Silarus and Frento. It comprehended, (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Apulia, including Calabria; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Lucania; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Bruttium.</p>
 <p>Augustus divided Italy into the following eleven Regiones: I. Latium and Campania. II. The land of the Hirpini, Apulia, and Calabria. III. Lucania and Bruttium. IV. The land of the Frentani, Marrucini, Paeligni, Marsi, Vestini, and Sabini, together with Samnium. V. Picenum. VI. Umbria and the district of Ariminum, in what was formerly called Gallia Cisalpina. VII. Etruria. VIII. Gallia Cispadana. IX. Liguria. X. The eastern part of Gallia Transpadana, Venetia, Carnia, and Istria. XI. The western part of Gallia Transpadana.

In each of these parts there is a mountain ridge of considerable height—the one in the north called Neritum, and the one in the south Neium. The city of Ithaca, the residence of Odysseus, was situated <cb /> on a precipitous, conical hill, now called Aëto, or “eagle's cliff,” occupying the whole breadth of the isthmus mentioned above.

 <p>(2) A fortress of Messenia, on a mountain of the same name. It was celebrated for the long and obstinate defence (ten years) which the Messenians there made in their last revolt against the Spartans. The mountain was said to have derived its name from Ithomé, one of the nymphs that nourished Zeus. On the summit was the altar of Zeus Ithometes, to whom the mountain was especially dedicated. Strabo compares the Messenian Acropolis to the Acrocorinthus, being situated, like that citadel, on a lofty and steep mountain, enclosed by fortified lines which connected it with the town. Hence these were justly deemed the two strongest places in the Peloponnesus. When Philip, the son of Demetrius, was planning the conquest of the peninsula with Demetrius of Pharos, the latter advised him to seize first the horns of the heifer, which would secure to him possession of the animal. By these enigmatical expressions he designated the Peloponnesus and the two strongholds above mentioned (Polyb. vii. 11). Remains of the ancient fortress still exist, the towers being magnificent specimens of military architecture and engineering.

It was painted at Kolmar in 1265 on the model of an original map which dates back to the middle of the third century A.D., and consists of twelve broad strips of parchment, on which are delineated all those parts of the world which were known to the Romans; only the pieces which should contain Spain and Britain are lost, with the exception of part of Kent. It is probably derived from Agrippa's map. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgeographia">Geographia</ref>.)

The Jews came into historical contact with the Greeks during the Asiatic campaigns of Alexander the Great, who in 332, on his march through Palestine, spared Jerusalem and its temple at the intercession of Jaddua the highpriest. During the following century, when Iudaea became subject to Alexander's successors, the Ptolemies and Seleucidae in Egypt and Syria, Greek philosophy and Greek culture were widely diffused among the Jews. The Sadducees appear to have been largely influenced by the Epicurean doctrines, and the stricter Pharisees by the Even the worship of the Grecian gods made considerable progress in Iudaea, and the Greek language came into common use. Many Jews were drawn to Alexandria soon after the founding of that city, and enjoyed these unusual privileges under both Ptolemy I. and Ptolemy II. (B.C. 323- 247). Under the latter the celebrated translation of the Old Testament, known as the Septuagint, was made by a body of Jewish scholars, seventy in number, and this Greek version was even used in the synagogues. In B.C. 198 the Jews aided Antiochus the Great in expelling the Egyptians from Palestine; but found to their sorrow that, under the new régime of the Seleucidae, their lot was much less favourable, for an attempt was soon made to Hellenize the Empire at the expense of some of the most cherished Jewish traditions. The treasury of the temple at Jerusalem was several times robbed of its treasures; and in 169, owing to a revolt against the king of Syria, a general massacre of the inhabitants of that city occurred. At the same time its walls were destroyed, the image of Antiochus was placed in the temple, swine were sacrificed on its altar, the Jewish Scriptures were publicly burned, shrines to Zeus were erected, and great cruelty was shown to the surviving inhabitants. This savage rule was checked by the great revolt headed by the Maccabees, the priest Mattathias, and his five sons, under whom the Jews freed the land for a time (167-63) and defeated the Syrian armies, forming alliances with the Romans.</p>
 <p>In B.C. 63 a civil war between the Jewish claimants for political power led to the intervention of Pompey, who had been invoked as arbiter. He laid siege to Jerusalem, violated the temple, even entering the Holy of Holies, and finally reduced 
<pb n="895" /><cb /> Iudaea to the form of a Roman province. In 39 Herod the Great, having won the favour of the Second Triumvirate, was installed as king of Iudaea, and kept himself in power by his servile flattery of M. Antonius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossherodes">Herodes</ref>.) At the death of Herod, Augustus Caesar divided his territories among his sons—Archelaüs, Philip, and Herodes Antipas; but a state of anarchy ensued, and the country was re-annexed to the Roman dominions. Under the emperors, the Jews suffered greatly from the oppression of their governors. Their religion was insulted, and their property wrung from them by the exactions of the procurators. Under Nero, a great revolt took place, owing to the severities of the governor Gessius Florus; and Jerusalem fell into the hands of the insurgents. The Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus , was routed by the Jewish army. The revolt, however, was crushed by Vespasian, who took Jerusalem after a memorable siege (A.D. 68), in which the sufferings of the besieged and the ferocity of their defence are immortalized in the narrative of <ref type="cross" target="crossiosephus">Iosephus</ref> (q.v.). The city was razed to the ground; and a new city, reared under Hadrian, received the name Aelia Capitolina. Into this no Jew was allowed to enter.</p>
 <p>The Romans seem to have felt considerable interest in the Jews, being attracted by their monotheistic religion, though failing to understand it rightly, and accepting many strange stories regarding it. Thus, it was asserted that the Jews worshipped clouds and thunder ( <bibl n="Juv.  14. 97" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xiv. 97</bibl>, with Mayor's note); that they adored an ass's head ( Apion in Ios. ii. 7); that they ate human flesh (Apion , <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 19" default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>19</bibl>, Didot); that they made it a practice annually to cook and eat a Greek, swearing hostility to the Greek race ( Apion in Ios. ii. 7). Nevertheless, the spiritual beauty of the Jewish faith impressed many serious minds among both the Greeks and Romans. Tacitus, in his <title>Historiae</title>, pays a high tribute to the Jews; and there are many instances recorded of acts of reverence paid by the Romans to the Mosaic religion. Thus, Cumanus ordered the execution of a soldier who had torn and burned the book of the law; Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, visited the temple daily during his stay in Jerusalem, and offered sacrifices there; Iulius Caesar, before this, had removed restrictions set upon the practice of the Jewish faith, so that at his funeral rites the Jews took a conspicuous part in the public mourning ( <title>Iul.</title> 84, with Peck's note). They were regarded as especially given to making proselytes (cf.  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 4" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 4</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 43" default="NO"> Sat., 43</bibl>; Ioseph. <title>Ant. Jud.</title> vii. 3, 3), and were successful in spreading their religion (Dio Cass. lxvii. 14. 2), especially among women ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 542" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 542</bibl> foll.; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Ars 1.76" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>A. A.</title> i. 76</bibl>). When the Romans began to import Oriental rites, the Sabbath was superstitiously observed by many ( <title>De Superst.</title> iii. p. 166 <seg lang="la">a;</seg> cf.  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 9" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 9</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 69" default="NO"> Sat., 69</bibl>). From the similarity of many of their usages, the Jews and Christians were often regarded as identical.</p>

<head orig="Iudex">Iudex</head>

 <p> In the Roman constitution a general designation of all judges, whether officials exercising judicial functions or individuals in a private position intrusted on oath with the duty of deciding in either civil or criminal trials. For standing and for extraordinary criminal courts (see <ref type="cross" target="crossquaestio">Quaestio</ref>) the iudices were at first chosen from the number of the senators by agreement of the parties concerned. Gaius Gracchus first introduced a list of iudices (<seg lang="la">album</seg>) for the permanent tribunals (<seg lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</seg>). At first this list was permanent, but afterwards it was published annually by the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg>, who had to swear that he would be impartial in his selection of names. Under the Empire, as long as the <seg lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</seg> existed, it was published by the emperor, who nominated the iudices to hold office for life, and from time to time revised and completed the list. By the lex Sempronia of Gaius Gracchus (B.C. 123), the office of judge was taken away from the senators, who had held it previously, and transferred to the possessors of the knight's census (the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>). In B.C. 80 a lex Cornelia of L. Cornelius Sulla restored it to the Senate. In B.C. 70 the office was equally divided between the senators, the knights, and the <seg lang="la">tribuni aerarii.</seg> These last were once more excluded by Caesar. Augustus formed four <seg lang="la">decuriae</seg>, or divisions, of iudices. Of these the first three were obliged to possess the knight's census, and the last the half of it. Caligula added a fifth decuria.</p>
 <p>Under the Empire the judicial functions, hitherto confined to certain definite classes, had become so general in their obligations that it was considered a privilege to be freed from them. This exemption was granted to a man with many children, and, afterwards, to those following the professions of grammarians and teachers. The requisite qualifications, apart from that of property, were that a person should be by birth a citizen, and not less than thirty years of age (after Augustus, not less than twenty-five). The other requirements were bodily and mental capacity, an unblemished reputation, and a long residence in Italy. Under the Republic the number of those who were sworn in varied at different times; under the Empire it was fixed at 4000, and later at 5000. For every court of justice the judges were taken from the general list by lot, and out of this special list the presiding magistrate appointed a definite number for each trial. Out of these a certain number might be challenged and rejected by either side; perhaps the president filled up the vacancies by again drawing lots. The swearing in took place before the trial. When the number of the praetors appointed for the <seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg> was not sufficiently large, a <seg lang="la">iudex quaestionis</seg> was appointed, generally one who had served as aedile.</p>
 <p>In civil cases it was customary from early times for the judicial magistrates—i. e. the praetors—to depute the investigation and decision to a person instructed by them and appointed by consent of both sides, who was styled <seg lang="la">iudex pedaneus</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">χαμαι δικαστής</foreign>), and corresponded with the referee of New York state law. The terms <seg lang="la">arbiter, iudex delegatus</seg>, and <seg lang="la">iudex specialis</seg> are also used of such 
<pb n="896" /><cb /> a person. From the time of Augustus a single judge (<seg lang="la">iudex unus</seg>) was appointed in each case from the general <seg lang="la">album</seg> of sworn iudices, but for certain cases several judges were introduced. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrecuperatores">Recuperatores</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossjudicial-procedure">Judicial Procedure</ref>, II.) The <seg lang="la">iudices centumviri</seg> formed the single great judicial body for trying civil cases. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscentumviri">Centumviri</ref>.) Concerning the <seg lang="la">iudices litibus iudicandis</seg>, who were also appointed in civil cases, see <ref type="cross" target="crossvigintisexviri">Viginti-sex Viri</ref>.

 <p> A defendant who had been condemned in an action was under an obligation to satisfy the judgment—i. e. to pay to the plaintiff the sum of money which the iudex had awarded; and the actio iudicati was the mode which the successful party had to adopt in order to compel the defendant to fulfil his obligation. The ground of the actio iudicati being the judgment debt, the defendant was not allowed to go behind the judgment and dispute the original claim, but might set up the plea that the judgment was invalid. If defeated in the action he was mulcted in double the original amount.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰουγούρθας</foreign>). An illegitimate son of Mastanabal, and grandson of Masinissa. He lost his father at an early age, but was brought up by Micipsa with his own sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal. Iugurtha was a brave, able, and ambitious prince, and distinguished himself greatly while serving under Scipio against Numantia, in B.C. 134. Micipsa, on his death in 118, bequeathed his kingdom to Iugurtha and his two sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal, in common. Iugurtha aspired to the sole sovereignty. He assassinated Hiempsal soon after his father's death, and a division of the kingdom between Iugurtha and Adherbal was then made by the Roman Senate; but shortly afterwards Iugurtha attacked Adherbal, took him prisoner, and put him to death (112). The Romans had previously commanded Iugurtha to abstain from hostilities against Adherbal; and as he had paid no attention to their commands, they now declared war against him. The consul L. Calpurnius Bestia was sent into Africa (111); but by large sums of money Iugurtha purchased from him a favourable peace—a disgraceful proceeding which excited the greatest indignation at Rome. The peace was disowned, and the war renewed under the command of the consul Sp. Postumius Albinus; but during the absence of the consul, his brother Aulus was defeated by Iugurtha (110). Next year (109) the consul Q. Caecilius Metellus, an able general and incorruptible man, was sent into Africa at the head of a new army. In the course of two years Metellus frequently defeated Iugurtha, and at length drove him to take refuge among the Gaetulians. In 107 Metellus was succeeded in the command by Marius. The cause of Iugurtha was now supported by his father-in-law, Bocchus, king of Mauretania; but Marius defeated their united forces, and Bocchus purchased the forgiveness of the Romans by surrendering his son-in-law to Sulla , the quaestor of Marius (106). Iugurtha was carried a prisoner to Rome, and after adorning the triumph of Marius (January 1, 104), was thrown into a dungeon, and there starved to death. The history of the Jugurthine War was written by Sallust, and is a masterpiece of historical composition. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssallustius">Sallustius</ref>.

<head orig="Iulia">Iulia</head>

 <p> (1) A daughter of Iulius Caesar by Cornelia, celebrated for her beauty and excellent character. She had been affianced to Servilius Caepio, and was on the point of being given to him in marriage, when her father bestowed her upon Pompey ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>47</bibl>; Appian. <title>B. C.</title> i. 14). Iulia possessed great influence over both her father and her husband, and as long as she lived prevented any outbreak between them. Her sudden death, however, in childbed, severed the tie that had in some degree bound Pompey to his father-in-law, and no private considerations any longer existed to allay 
<pb n="897" /><cb />
 the jealousies which political disputes might arouse between them. The amiable character of Iulia, and her constant affection for her husband, gained for her the general regard of the people; and this they showed by insisting on celebrating her funeral in the Campus Martius, a compliment scarcely ever paid to a woman before ( <title>Iul.</title> 21, 26, 84).</p>
 <p>(2) The sister of Iulius Caesar. She married M. Atius Balbus, and became by him the mother of Octavia Minor and Augustus ( <title>Iul.</title> 74; <bibl n="Cic. Aug. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>4</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Aug. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> Aug., 8</bibl>).</p>

 <p>(4) The daughter of Augustus by his first wife Scribonia. As he had no children by Livia, whom he had subsequently espoused, Iulia remained his <figure id="fig.00897">
<head orig="Iulia, daughter or Augustus.">Iulia, daughter or Augustus.</head>
</figure> sole heiress, and the choice of her husband became a matter of great importance. She was first married to her cousin M. Marcellus (B.C. 25), the nephew of Augustus by his sister Octavia, and the person celebrated by Vergil in the famous lines of the sixth <title>Aeneid.</title> But Marcellus dying young and without children, Augustus selected for the second husband of his daughter his oldest friend and most useful adherent, M. Vipsanius Agrippa. This marriage seemed to answer all the wishes of Augustus, for Iulia became the mother of five children—Gaius , Lucius, Iulia, Agrippina, and Agrippa Postumus. Agrippa died B.C. 12, and Iulia was married, for the third time, to Tiberius Claudius Nero, the son of Livia, and afterwards emperor. Tiberius subsequently thought proper to withdraw from Rome to the island of Rhodes, where he lived in the greatest retirement. During his absence, his wife Iulia was guilty of such gross infidelities towards him that Augustus himself divorced her in the name of his son-in-law, and banished her to the island of Pandataria, off the Campanian coast, where she was closely confined for some time, and treated with the greatest rigour; nor would Augustus ever forgive her, or receive her again into his presence, although he afterwards removed her from Pandataria to Rhegium, and somewhat softened the severity of her treatment. When her husband Tiberius ascended the throne (A.D. 14) she was again severely dealt with, and soon died of ill-treatment and starvation.</p>
 <p>(5) The granddaughter of Augustus, and daughter of Agrippa and Iulia</p>
 <p>(4). She was married to L. Paulus, but, imitating the licentious conduct of her mother, was banished by Augustus for her adulterous practices to the island of Tremerus, off the coast of Apulia, where she continued to live for the space of twenty years, and where at last she died ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 71" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 71</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(6) A daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina, married in A.D. 33 to M. Vinicius. She was cut off by the intrigues of Messalina, who accused her of adultery with the <cb /> philosopher Seneca (Dio Cass. lix. 3, 8).</p>
 <p>(7) Daughter of Caligula and Milonia Caesaria. Her father carried her to the temples of all the goddesses, and dedicated her to Minerva, as the patroness of her education. She showed in her infancy strong indications of the cruelty that branded both her parents. She suffered death with her mother after the assassination of Caligula ( <title>Calig.</title> 25, 59).</p>

 <p>A Roman emperor, popularly known as “ Julian the Apostate” <figure id="fig.00897.3">
<head orig="Iulianus.">Iulianus.</head>
</figure> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἀποστάτης</foreign>). He was born at Constantinople in A.D. 331, the youngest son of Iulius Constantius, half-brother to Constantine the Great. On the death of Constantine there was a general massacre of the male members of the younger line of the Flavian family, and among those so put to death was Julian 's father, Julian being spared only on account of his extreme youth. He was reared under close and vexatious surveillance at Macellum in Cappadocia and at Nicomedia, and the treatment which he and his family had received from nominal Christians both embittered him and led him to reject Christianity, he being also won back to paganism by the teaching of his Neoplatonic master Maximus. In 355 he studied at Athens, among his fellow-students being the future bishops Basil and Gregory Nanzianzenus. 
<pb n="898" /><cb /> In November of the same year Julian was summoned to Milan to assume the rank of Caesar. He married the emperor's sister Helena.</p>
 <p>During the next five years he joined the army in Germania and defeated the Alemanni near Argentoratum (Strassburg), and also subdued the Franks along the Rhine, winning at the same time the affections of the people by his courage, mildness, and simplicity. In April, 360, the emperor, becoming alarmed at Julian 's popularity, ordered away some of his best troops, upon which his soldiers revolted, and proclaimed him as Augustus. Soon after, he sent forward the greater part of his army by way of Rhaetia and Noricum, and himself with a picked body of 3000 men plunged into the Black Forest, sailing down the Danube to Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior, which he had made the rendezvous of his forces. Here he heard of the death of the emperor (November 3, 361), and here he openly proclaimed himself a pagan, sacrificing to the old gods of Rome. Though he tolerated the Jewish and the Christian religions, he did all that lay in his power to cripple the spread of the latter. He confiscated the revenues of the churches, and ordered that those who had assisted in pulling down the heathen temples should rebuild them. This was the signal for a fearful reaction and persecution against the Christians in the provinces, where many were imprisoned, tormented, and even put to death. Julian restrained or punished some of these disorders, but with no very zealous hand. There was evidently a determined struggle throughout the Empire between the old and the new religion, and Julian wished for the triumph of the former. He forbade the Christians to read, or teach to others, the works of the ancient classic writers, saying that, as they rejected the gods, they ought not to avail themselves of the learning and genius of those who believed in them. He also forbade their filling any office, civil or military, and subjected them to other disabilities and humiliations.</p>
 <p>In July, 362, he resolved upon war with the Persians, and spent some months at Antioch. Gibbon has given a powerful, though no doubt too highly coloured, picture of the emperor—awkward, shy, and unkempt, with ink-stained fingers, long nails, and vermin-infested beard—at whom the citizens of this luxurious capital sneered and aimed lampoons.

 <p>It was during his residence at Antioch that Julian undertook to aim what he thought would prove a deadly blow to Christianity. An order was issued for rebuilding the great temple of Jerusalem. The Jews were invited from all the provinces of the Empire to assemble on the holy mountain of their fathers, and a bold attempt was thus made to falsify the language of prophecy and annul the decree which the Christians believed to have been pronounced by the Almighty against his once chosen, but now rejected, people. The accomplishment of this design was intrusted to Alypius, who had been governor of Britain, and every effort was made to insure its success as well on the part of the “imperial sophist” as on that of the Jews themselves. But the attempt was an unavailing one, and is said to have been signally and miraculously interrupted. Few historical facts, indeed, rest on more abundant testimony. The narratives of Gregory Nanzianzenus and of Rufinus are <cb /> confirmed in the fullest manner by Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a heathen writer. “When Alypius,” observes Ammianus, “was plying the work vigorously, and the governor of the province was lending his aid, fearful globes of fire, bursting forth repeatedly from the earth close to the foundations, scorched the workmen, and rendered the place, after frequent trials on their part, quite inaccessible.” The Jewish rabbis, in their annals, attest the same fact; and even Gibbon, though in his solemnly sneering way he styles it a “splendid and specious miracle,” is obliged to treat the evidence with respect. See <bibl default="NO">Newman, <title>Essay on the Miracles in Early Ecclesiastical History</title> (1842)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>In March, 363, Julian set out on his expedition against the Persian king Sapor, and advanced upon Ctesiphon. Proceeding still farther, with a treacherous guide and under a burning sun, he was continually assailed by the Persian cavalry; and in one of their onslaughts the emperor was wounded by a spear-thrust in the side and fell from his horse, the blood spurting from the wound. Theodoretus relates that as he saw the ghastly injury the dying man exclaimed, “Thou hast conquered, Galilaean; yet still do I renounce thee!” He passed away at midnight of June 26, 363.</p>
 <p>Julian 's life is one of much pathetic interest, and is a sad instance of noble views distorted and of powers misapplied, with failure as the inevitable result; for, as Beugnot says, it was an accident, after which events reverted to their natural channel. Christianity was scarcely checked for a single moment in its spread, and the ill-success of its imperial opponent only added to his prestige. Julian 's extant writings are as follows: seventeen <title>Epistles;</title> nine <title>Orations;</title> a satirical sketch called <title>Caesares</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Καίσαρες ἤ Συμπόσιον</foreign>), in which the deified Romulus gives a banquet to the gods and, at a separate table, to the Caesars, who are made to pass in review before Silenus, who comments upon them; and finally, the <foreign lang="greek">Μισοπώγων</foreign> already mentioned. His work against the Christians is now lost. It was answered by Apollinarius of Laodicea and others. To the reply of Apollinarius, Julian put forth this <seg lang="la">jeu de mots</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνέγνων, ἔγνων, κατέγνων</foreign> (“I have read it, understood it, and condemned it”). On this, St. Basil remarked, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνέγνως ἀλλ οὐκ ἔγνως· εἰ γὰρ ἔγνως οὐκ ἄν κατέγνως</foreign> (“Thou hast read it, but hast not understood it; for hadst thou done so, thou wouldst not have condemned it”).</p>

<div2 id="crossiuno" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Iuno">Iuno</head>

 <p> A name which contains the same root <hi rend="SmallCaps">div</hi>, “to shine,” as the name <ref type="cross" target="crossiupiter">Iupiter</ref> (q.v.). As Iupiter was the king of heaven and of the gods, so Iuno was, in the Roman mythology, the queen of heaven, or the female Iupiter. She was worshipped as the queen of heaven, from early times, with the surname of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Regīna</hi>. At a later period her worship was solemnly transferred from Veii to Rome, where a sanctuary was dedicated to her on the Aventine. As Iupiter was the protector of the male sex, so Iuno watched over women, accompanying every woman through life, from the moment of birth to that of death. Hence she bore the special surnames of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Virginālis</hi> and <ref type="cross" target="crossmatrona">Matrōna</ref>, as well as the general ones of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Opigĕna</hi> and <ref type="cross" target="crosssospita">Sospĭta</ref>, and under the last-mentioned name she was worshipped at Lanuvium. On their birthday women offered sacrifices to Iuno surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Natālis</hi>, just as men sacrificed to their <seg lang="la">genius natalis.</seg> The great festival, celebrated by all the women, in honour of Iuno, was called Matronalia, and took place on the 1st of March. Her protection of women, and especially her power of making them fruitful, is further alluded to in the festival Populifugia (q. v.), as well as in the surname of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Febrūlis, Februāta, Febrūta</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Februālis</hi>. Iuno was further, like Saturn, the guardian of the finances, and under the name of <ref type="cross" target="crossmoneta">Monēta</ref> she had a temple on the Capitoline Hill, which contained the mint. The most important period in a woman's life is that of her marriage, and Iuno was therefore believed especially to preside over marriage. Hence she was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iuga</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iugālis</hi>, and had a variety of other names, such as <ref type="cross" target="crosspronuba">Pronŭba</ref>, Cinxia, <ref type="cross" target="crosslucina">Lucīna</ref>, etc. The month of June, which is said to have been originally called Iunonius, was considered to be the most favourable period for marrying. Women in childbed invoked Iuno Lucina to help them, and newly-born children were likewise under her protection; hence she was sometimes confounded with the Greek Artemis or Ilithyia. In Etruria she was worshipped under the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cupra</hi>. She was also worshipped at Falerii, Lanuvium, <cb /> Aricia, Tibur, Praenesté, and other places. In the representations of the Roman Iuno that have come down to us, the type of the Greek Heré is commonly adopted. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshere">Heré</ref>.

<div2 id="crossiupiter" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Iupĭter">Iupiter</head>

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Iuppĭter</hi>). The chief of the gods in the Roman mythology. He was originally an elemental divinity, and his name signifies the father or lord of heaven, being a contraction of <title>Diovis pater</title>, or <title>Diespiter</title> (Skt. <title>Dyāus pitar;</title> cf. the Teutonic <title>Tiu</title> or <title>Zio</title>). Being the lord of heaven, he was worshipped as the god of light, rain, storms, thunder, and lightning, whence he had the epithets of Lucetius, Imbricĭtor, Serenātor, <ref type="cross" target="crosspluvius">Pluvius</ref>, Fulgurātor, Tonitruālis, Tonans, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fulminātor</hi>. As the pebble or flint stone was regarded as the symbol of lightning, Iupiter was frequently represented with such a stone in his hand instead of a thunderbolt. In concluding a treaty, the Romans took the sacred symbols of Iupiter—i. e. the sceptre and flint stone—together with some grass from his temple, and the oath taken on such an occasion was expressed by <title>per Iovem Lapidem jurare.</title> In consequence of his possessing such powers over the elements, and especially of his always having the thunderbolt at his command, he was regarded as the highest and most powerful among the gods. Hence he is called the Best and Greatest (<title>Optimus Maximus</title>). His temple at Rome stood on the lofty hill of the Capitol, whence he derived the surnames <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitolinus">Capitolīnus</ref> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tarpēius</hi>. The Ides of each month were sacred to him. He was regarded as the special protector of Rome. As such he was worshipped by the consuls on entering upon their office; and the triumph of a victorious general was a solemn procession to his temple. He therefore bore the surnames of <ref type="cross" target="crossimperator">Imperātor</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossvictor">Victor</ref>, Invictus, <ref type="cross" target="crossstator">Stator</ref>, Opitŭlus, <ref type="cross" target="crossferetrius">Feretrius</ref>, Praedātor, Triumphātor, and the like. Under all these surnames he had temples or statues at Rome; and two temples, viz. those of Iupiter Stator and of Iupiter Feretrius, were believed to have been built in the time of Romulus. Under the name of Iupiter Capitolinus, he presided over the great Roman games; and under the name of Iupiter Latialis or Latiaris, over the Feriae Latinae.</p>
 <p>Iupiter, according to the belief of the Romans, determined the course of all human affairs. He foresaw the future, and the events happening in it were the results of his will. He revealed the future to men through signs in the heavens and the flight of birds, which are hence called his messengers, while the god himself is designated as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Prodigiālis</hi>—that is, “sender of prodigies.” For the same reason the god was invoked at the beginning of every undertaking, whether sacred or profane, together with Ianus, who blessed the beginning itself. Iupiter was further regarded as the guardian of law and as the protector of justice and virtue. He maintained the sanctity of 
<pb n="900" /><cb />
 an oath, and presided over all transactions which were based upon faithfulness and justice. Hence Fides was his companion on the Capitol along with Victoria; and hence a traitor to his country; and persons guilty of perjury were thrown down from the Tarpeian Rock.</p>
 <p>As Iupiter was the lord of heaven, and consequently the prince of light, the white colour was sacred to him, white animals were sacrificed to him, his chariot was believed to be drawn by four white horses, his priests wore white caps (<seg lang="la">albogaleri</seg>), and the consuls were attired in white when they offered sacrifices in the Capitol the day they entered on their office. The worship of Iupiter at Rome was under the special care of the Flamen Dialis, who was the highest in rank of all the flamens. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossflamen">Flamen</ref>.) The Romans, in their representations of the god, adopted the type of the Greek Zeus (see <ref type="cross" target="crosszeus">Zeus</ref>); but the Roman conception of Iupiter differs from the Greek conception of Zeus in being more purely animistic as distinct from anthropomorphic. Hence we do not find Iupiter as the subject of plastic art until the later (Graeco-Roman) period. Cf. Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, i. pp. 41, 52, 53 <bibl default="NO">(Amer. ed. 1888)</bibl>.

 <p> A post-classical term defined by the <title>Digest</title> (i. 1, 10) as the knowledge of what is legally right and wrong (<seg lang="la">iusti atque iniusti scientia</seg>). The science of law is the one branch of Roman literature which had a purely national development. From an early date there were definite legal ordinances in Rome, and shortly after the expulsion of the kings a collection of <seg lang="la">leges regiae</seg> was made by a certain Papirius. These consisted of archaic customary laws of a strongly sacerdotal character, and arbitrarily attributed to individual kings (known as the <title>Ius Papirianum</title>). However, the foundation of the collective legal life of the Romans was primarily the well-known law of the Twelve Tables, B.C. 451-450. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstwelve-tables">Twelve Tables</ref>.) This put an end to the want of a generally known law; for the knowledge of previous legal decisions, like the whole of the judicial procedure, had been hitherto kept in <cb /> the exclusive possession of the patricians. The administration of the law remained as formerly in the hands of the patricians alone, for they kept from the plebeians all knowledge of the <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg> and <seg lang="la">nefasti</seg>—i. e. the days on which legal proceedings might or might not be taken, as also the forms of pleading which were regularly employed (<seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg>). The latter were so highly important that the least infraction of them would involve the loss of the cause. This condition of things existed for a long time, until Appius Claudius Caecus drew up a calendar of the days on which causes could be pleaded, and a list of the forms of pleading. These were made public about B.C. 304 by his secretary, Gnaeus Flavius, after whom they were then called <title>Ius Flavianum.</title> By these means a knowledge of the law became generally attainable. It soon had eminent representatives among the plebeians in the persons of Publius Sempronius Sophus and Tiberius Coruncanius. In ancient days, however, the work of the jurists was purely practical. It was considered an honourable thing for men learned in the law (<seg lang="la">iuris periti</seg>) to allow people to consult them (<seg lang="la">consulere</seg>, hence <seg lang="la">iuris</seg>, or <seg lang="la">iure consulti</seg>) either in the Forum or at appointed hours in their own houses, and to give them legal advice (<seg lang="la">responsa</seg>). It was mainly by a kind of oral tradition that the knowledge of law was handed down, as the most eminent jurists allowed younger men to be present at these consultations as listeners (<seg lang="la">auditores</seg> or <seg lang="la">discipuli</seg>).</p>
 <p>The beginning of literary activity in this department, as in others, dates from the Second Punic War. It begins with the earliest exposition of existing law. Sextus Aelius Catus published in B.C. 204 a work named <title>Tripertita</title> (from its being divided into three parts) or <title>Ius Aelianum</title>, which consisted of the text of the laws of the Twelve Tables together with interpretations, and the legal <seg lang="la">formulae</seg> for carrying on suits. From the middle of the second century it became common to make collections of the <seg lang="la">responsa</seg> of eminent jurists, and to use them as a source of legal information. Among others, Marcus Porcius Cato , the son of Cato the Elder, made a collection of this kind. In some families knowledge of the law was in a measure hereditary, as in those of the Aelii, Porcii, Sulpicii, and Mucii. A member of the last family, the pontifex Quintus Mucius Scaevola (died B.C. 82), was the first who, with the aid of the formal precision of the Stoic philosophy, gave a scientific and systematic account of all existing law, in his work, <title>De Iure Civili.</title> Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the contemporary and friend of Cicero, further advanced this new and more methodical treatment of law by his numerous writings and by training up pupils, such as Aulus Ofilius and Publius Alfenus Varus. The former rendered great assistance to Caesar in his scheme for forming the whole of the <title>Ius Civile</title> into a single code. Besides these there were several eminent jurists at the close of the Republic: Gaius Trebatius Testa, Quintus Aelius Tubero, Gaius Aelius Gallus , and Aulus Cascellius.</p>
 <p>While under the Republic the learned jurist had held an inferior position to the orator in influence and importance, there is no doubt that under the Empire public eloquence became subordinate, and the position of the jurists was the most coveted and influential in the State, especially when Augustus decreed that the opinions of jurists authorized 
<pb n="901" /><cb /> by the head of the State were to have the validity of law. It was from the jurists as advisers of the emperor that all legislation now proceeded. They had access to all the highest offices of the court and of the State. Accordingly men of the highest gifts and character betook themselves naturally to this profession, and even introduced into the laws an increased unity, consistency, and systematic order. Under Augustus two jurists were pre-eminent, Quintus Antistius Labeo and Gaius Ateius Capito, the founders of the two later schools, named, after their pupils Sempronius Proculus and Masurius Sabinus, the “Proculiani” and “Sabini” respectively. Labeo sought to extend his professional knowledge, while Capito held fast to the traditions of former jurists. A third school was that of the Cassiani, who took their name from the jurist Cassius Longinus (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> vii. 24, 8), and represented a mean between the conservatism of Capito and the innovating spirit of Labeo.</p>
 <p>The first scientific collection of laws was made under Hadrian by the Sabinian lawyer Salvius Iulianus, with his <title>Edictum Perpetuum</title>, a classified collection of the praetorian edicts from the times of the Republic. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossedictum">Edictum</ref>.) Sextus Pomponius, his somewhat younger contemporary, composed among other things a history of the law till the time of Hadrian.</p>
 <p>Under the Antonines jurisprudence was able to claim a remarkable representative in the Asiatic Gaius, but it received its completion and conclusion in the first half of the third century A.D. through Aemilius Papinianus, Domitius Ulpianus, and Iulius Paulus. After their time there were no jurists of great and original capacity. In the fourth century literary activity revived again, but confined itself to the collection of legal authorities, especially that of imperial ordinances. Thus the <title>Codex Theodosianus</title>, finished in A.D. 438, contains an official record of all the enactments decreed by the emperors from the time of Constantine. Under Justinian I. (A.D. 527-565) the last and most complete Roman collection of laws was made, under the name of the <title>Corpus Iuris Civilis</title> (q. v.).</p>

<head orig="Ius">Ius</head>

 <p> (1) In the widest sense, right or justice (so <seg lang="la">ius reddere</seg>); and, derivatively, the place where justice is dispensed, the tribunal of the praetor (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossactio">Actio</ref>); but usually law, the system of social order enforced by the community. More strictly, human law as contrasted with <seg lang="la">fas</seg>, the divine law. (Nevertheless, the body of ancient rules which regulated the intercourse of the city-states of Italy, and which seems to have been a part of <seg lang="la">fas</seg>, was termed <title>ius fetiale.) Ius</title>, in the sense of human law, may be either customary in its origin (<seg lang="la">ius moribus constitutum</seg>) or statutory (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex</ref>). The two make up the <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg> or municipal law of each State. <title>Ius civile</title>, unqualified, usually means the civil law of Rome, more precisely designated as the law of the Quirites (<title>ius Quiritium</title>). Such principles of law as were common to all the Mediterranean States, and were applied by the Romans in cases where others than Roman citizens were concerned, were termed <seg lang="la">ius gentium.</seg> This <seg lang="la">ius gentium</seg> <cb /> was often identified with natural law, but in the early Imperial period <seg lang="la">ius naturale</seg> commonly designated the postulates of natural reason and the sense of right. Closely analogous, therefore, is the conception of <seg lang="la">ius aequum</seg> as opposed to <seg lang="la">ius strictum.</seg> It was the acceptance and development of <seg lang="la">ius gentium</seg> and <seg lang="la">ius naturale</seg> that gave to the Roman law of the Imperial period its character of universality. The chief agencies in this development were (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the edicts of the praetors (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossedictum">Edictum</ref>) during the last two centuries of the Republic, and (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the writings of the great jurists (<seg lang="la">iurisperiti, iurisprudentes</seg>), especially of those to whose opinions the emperors gave legal authority by granting them the <seg lang="la">ius respondendi.</seg> The edict law was sometimes distinguished from the <seg lang="la">ius</seg> (sc. <seg lang="la">civile</seg>), as English lawyers contrast “equity” and “law”; but the distinction, as in English law, was essentially historical. The real authority of the edict and the source of its authority—viz. the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> of the praetor—were well expressed in terming it <seg lang="la">ius honorarium</seg> (Dig. i. 1, 7. 1, <seg lang="la">honor</seg>=office). The juristic literature of the second and third centuries was cited in the later Empire as the sole authority for all the older law (<seg lang="la">ius vetus</seg>), and was commonly described as the <seg lang="la">ius</seg>, in antithesis to the <seg lang="la">leges</seg> promulgated by the emperors.</p>
 <p><title>Ius publicum</title> embraces all those rules of law which primarily subserve public interests; <seg lang="la">ius privatum</seg> those which primarily subserve individual interests (Dig. i. 1, 1. 2). <title>Ius privatum</title> covers the law of the family and of property. <title>Ius singulare</title>, as opposed to <seg lang="la">ius commune</seg>, denotes a special rule contrary to the general spirit and tenor of the law (Dig. i. 3, 16).</p>
 <p>(2) A right, in the sense of a privilege granted to a special community or class. So the <title>ius Latii</title>, by which allies (<seg lang="la">socii</seg>) of Rome gained <seg lang="la">commercium</seg> and, in some cases, full Roman citizenship (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosslatinitas">Latinitas</ref>); the <title>ius Italicum</title>, by which, in the Imperial period, provincial cities obtained the same rights as those commonly possessed by Italian cities—viz. municipal self-government and exemption from poll and land taxes; the <seg lang="la">ius liberorum</seg>, by which the mother of at least three children was emancipated from guardianship and obtained a special capacity of inheritance.</p>
 <p>(3) A right in the ordinary legal sense, which may be political, like the <seg lang="la">ius suffragii</seg> or <seg lang="la">ius honorum</seg>, or private, like family and property rights. In the family relations, <seg lang="la">ius</seg> is frequently equivalent to <seg lang="la">potestas;</seg> wife and children are <seg lang="la">alieno iuri subjecti</seg>, an independent person is <seg lang="la">sui iuris.</seg> Property rights the Roman jurists divided into real and personal according as they were enforcible by <seg lang="la">actio in rem</seg> or only by <seg lang="la">actio in personam</seg> (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossactio">Actio</ref>). <title>Ius nudum</title> was a right without a remedy. The praetor could not make any person <seg lang="la">heres</seg> or <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> who was not <seg lang="la">heres</seg> or <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> by the old civil law; but he could give such a person <seg lang="la">bonorum possessio</seg> and the actions necessary to protect his possession; and by refusing to give actions to the civillaw owner, he made the latter's right <seg lang="la">ius nudum.</seg>

<div2 id="crossiusiurandum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Iusiurandum">Iusiurandum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὅρκος</foreign>). An oath, either formally and solemnly pronounced as a part of a religious or legal act, or loosely used in common life. Among the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greeks</hi> oaths were taken on important occasions, such as treaties, alliances, and other compacts, in making vows, in ratifying promises; and on many other occasions, such as the registry of a youth as an Athenian citizen (see <ref type="cross" target="crossephebi">Ephebi</ref>), the assumption of public office by kings and ephors in Sparta, and by archons, generals, judges, and other officials at Athens, by judges of the games, by both accuser and defendant in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossanacrisis">Anacrisis</ref>), and by witnesses (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmartyria">Martyria</ref>).</p>
 <p>Oaths were sworn in the name of all the gods together, or by the special deity appropriate to the special occasion, as when virgins swore by Artemis, married women by Heré, etc. Women had also their own peculiar oaths, <foreign lang="greek">μὰ τὼ θεώ</foreign> (“by the two goddesses,” i. e. Demeter and Persephoné), <foreign lang="greek">νὴ τὴν Ἀφροδίτην</foreign>, etc. The Spartans swore by Castor and Pollux as their national demigods, and the Athenians by their deities (Zeus, Poseidon, and Athené), much as in the age of chivalry the nations of Europe swore by their national saints. The Greeks also swore by whatever was especially dear to them—e. g. Achilles by his sceptre, warriors by their weapons, friends by their friendship. The most solemn oaths, however, were those that were sworn by Zeus (hence styled <foreign lang="greek">ὅρκιος</foreign>), who punished perjury both in this life and after death ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 19. 260" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xix. 260</bibl>; <title>Ol.</title> ii. 71). The gods themselves swore by the Styx as the most terrible of oaths ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 15. 36" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xv. 36</bibl> foll.). In taking an oath men usually stood, lifting up the hands and eyes to heaven, the oath being a sort of prayer; and sacrifices and libations were the accompaniments of the most solemn adjurations. To give them especial sanctity, oaths were often taken in temples, shrines, or sacred groves.</p>
 <p>Among the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi>, oaths were taken by the magistrates and other persons who entered the service of the State, by soldiers, by the <seg lang="la">fetiales</seg> in ratifying treaties with foreign powers, by the parties to a legal action before the praetor, by witnesses, and loosely by persons in the ordinary speech of common life. Under the Empire, oaths of allegiance were commonly taken by all subjects of the emperor, and on the recurrence of the day on which such an oath had been taken, it was customary to renew it, and also on the first day of each year. The form of this oath of allegiance <cb /> was probably the same as that of the <seg lang="la">sacramentum</seg> (see below). Vestal virgins and the Flamen Dialis were not allowed to swear on any occasion. Men swore by the gods, much as did the Greeks, by their genii, or by the genius of the emperor, and also by individuals or objects most dear to them. Favorite oaths were <title>Hercle</title> or <title>Mehercle</title> (i. e. <title>ita me Hercules iuvet); Pol, Perpol, Aedepol</title> (i. e. <title>per Pollucem, ah di Pollux); per Iovem</title> and <title>per Iovem Lapidem; per superos; per deos immortales; medius fidius</title> (i. e. <title>ita me deus Fidius iuvet); ita me dii ament.</title> Women never swore by Hercules nor men by Castor ( <bibl n="Gel.  11. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xi. 6</bibl>). The form called <seg lang="la">exsecratio</seg> was common. Thus, <seg lang="la">di me perdant ni . . .; dispeream; di me interficiant; ne vivam; ne salvus sim</seg>, etc.</p>
 <p>The oath taken in legal actions was called <seg lang="la">iusiurandum in iure</seg> and also <seg lang="la">iusiurandum necessarium</seg> as being required, and hence opposed to the <seg lang="la">iusiurandum voluntarium</seg> out of court. The oath taken by the Roman soldier was called <seg lang="la">sacramentum.</seg> It was taken on enlisting for a campaign, and first gave the soldier the right of using arms against the enemy. It thus distinguished legitimate warfare (<seg lang="la">militia</seg>) from mere rapine (<seg lang="la">latrocinium</seg>). It contained an <seg lang="la">exsecratio</seg>, and he who broke it was accursed (<seg lang="la">sacer</seg>). The formula of a <seg lang="la">sacramentum</seg> is given by Gellius (xvi. 4).</p>
 <p>The ancients, especially the Greeks, tried to check the indiscriminate use of oaths in daily life. To allow men to relieve their feelings without profanity, Rhadamanthus is said to have ordained swearing by the names of animals, much as in modern times resort is had to such expressions as “By Jingo!” “Thunder!” “Great Scott!” etc. Thus Socrates swore by the dog, Lampon by the goose, and such elliptical expressions as <foreign lang="greek">μὰ τὸν</foreign> (with the name of the deity suppressed) were common, just as in English men say “I swear!” ( <bibl default="NO"><title>Ran.</title> 1374</bibl>). See Lasaulx, <title>Ueber den Eid bei den Griechen;</title> Brissonius, <title>De Formulis</title>, etc.; and the article <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sponsio</hi>.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Flavius Anicius</hi>. A Roman emperor of the East, born in Illyria A.D. 482 or 483, of servile parentage. He was nephew on his mother's side to Iustinus, afterwards emperor. His original name was Uprauda. The elevation of his uncle to the throne, A.D. 518, decided the fortune of Justinian, who, having been educated at Constantinople, had given proofs of considerable capacity and application. Iustinus was ignorant and old, and the advice and exertions of his nephew were of great service to him during the nine years of his reign. He adopted Justinian as his colleague, and at length a few months before his death, feeling that his end was approaching, crowned him in presence of the patriarch and senators, and made over the imperial authority to him, in April, 527. Justinian was then in his forty-fifth year, and he ruled more than thirty-eight years, 
<pb n="903" /><cb /> till November, 565, when he died. His long reign forms a remarkable epoch in the history of the world. Although himself unwarlike, by means of his able generals, Belisarius and the eunuch Narses, he completely defeated the Vandals and the Goths, and restored Italy and Africa to the Empire. Justinian was the last emperor of Constantinople who, by his dominion over the whole of Italy, reunited in some measure the two principal portions of the ancient Empire of the Caesars. In the East, his arms repelled the inroads of Chosroës and conquered Colchis; and the Negus, or king of Abyssinia, entered into an alliance with him. On the Danubian frontier, the Gepidae, Langobardi, Bulgarians, and other hordes were either kept in check or wholly routed. The wars of his reign are related by Procopius and Agathias. <figure id="fig.00903">
<head orig="Iustinianus. (From a medal.)">Iustinianus. (From a medal.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Justinian must be viewed also as the administrator and legislator of a vast empire. In the first capacity he did much good and considerable harm. He was both profuse and penurious. Personally inclined to justice, he often overlooked, through weakness, the injustice of subordinates. He established monopolies of certain branches of industry and commerce, and increased the taxes; but he introduced the culture of silkworms into Europe, and the numerous edifices which he raised, and the towns which he repaired or fortified, attest his love for the arts, and his anxiety for the security and welfare of his dominions. Procopius gives a notice of the towns, churches (St. Sophia among the rest), convents, bridges, roads, walls, and fortifications constructed or repaired during his reign. The same Procopius, however, wrote a secret history (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀνέκδοτα</foreign>) of the court and reign of Justinian and his wife Theodora, both of whom he paints in the darkest colours. Theodora, previous to her marriage, indeed, had been a dissolute woman, but one of some ability, and she exercised till her death in 548, a great influence over the mind of Justinian. Many acts of oppression and cruelty were committed by her orders. At the same time the <title>Anecdota</title> of Procopius cannot be implicitly trusted, as many of his charges are evidently misrepresentations or malignant exaggerations.</p>
 <p>Justinian was easy of access, patient of bearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and perfect master of his temper. In the conspiracies against <cb /> his authority and person he often showed both justice and clemency. He was chaste and temperate, frequently fasting, and allowing himself little time for sleep. His restless application to business and to study, as well as the extent of his learning, have been attested even by his enemies ( <bibl n="Procop.  8. 13" default="NO">Procop.viii. 13</bibl>). He adorned Constantinople with many magnificent structures, among them the great church (now mosque) of St. Sophia. He was, or professed to be, a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian, a musician and architect; but the greatest act of his reign is the codification of the Roman law, which has immortalized his name, and an account of which will be found under the articles <hi rend="SmallCaps">Corpus Iuris</hi> and <ref type="cross" target="crosstribonianus">Tribonianus</ref>. He was, however, much more than a codifier, for the following fundamental changes were introduced by him: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) a great amelioration of the condition of slaves (see <ref type="cross" target="crossservus">Servus</ref>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) a change in the law of intestate succession by which <seg lang="la">cognati</seg> or relations on the mother's side inherited equally with <seg lang="la">agnati</seg> or relations on the father's side; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the introduction of a system of small-debt courts. Unfortunately, his love of theological controversy led him to interfere with the consciences of his subjects; and his penal enactments against Jews and heretics displayed a spirit of intolerance. He was succeeded by his nephew, Iustinus IV. See the biographies by Isambert <bibl default="NO">(1856)</bibl> and Body <bibl default="NO">(6th ed. 1889)</bibl>; also <bibl default="NO">Roby's <title>Introduction to the Digest</title> (1884)</bibl>.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The second of the name, the son of Constantine III., and lineal descendant of the emperor Heraclius. He succeeded his father on the throne of Constantinople, A.D. 685, but his reign, which lasted ten years, was marked chiefly by wars with the Saracens, and by the exactions and oppressions of his ministers. At last, his general Leontius drove him from the throne, and, having caused his nose to be cut off, banished him to the Crimea, A.D. 695. Leontius, however, was soon after himself deposed and banished by Tiberius Apsimerus, who reigned for seven years. Meantime Justinian had escaped from the Crimea and married the daughter of chief of the Gazari, a tribe of Turks; and he afterwards, with the assistance of the Bulgarians, entered Constantinople, and put to death both Leontius and Tiberius, along with many others. He ordered also many of the principal people of Ravenna to be killed. Justinian was finally dethroned and slain by Philippus Bardanes, A.D. 711.

 <head><surname full="yes">Iustīnus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">M. Iuniānus</foreName>
 <p>A Latin historian, generally supposed to have flourished in the age of the Antonines. Nothing is known of the particulars of Justin's life. He made an epitome or selection of extracts from the <title>Historiae Philippicae</title> of Trogus Pompeius, written under Augustus. This epitome is entitled, <title>Historiarum Philippicarum et Totius Mundi Originum, et Terrae Situs ex Trogo Pompeio Excerptarum Libri XLIV. a Nino ad Caesarem Augustum</title>, and it is best described as a history of the world down to the Roman conquest of the East. In making his extracts, Justin gave the preference to those facts and those passages which he considered peculiarly interesting. Other events are only mentioned briefly, and by way of transition. Chronology is entirely neglected in the work of Justin, as in the greater part of the ancient writers. His style is correct, simple, and elegant, but unequal; though preferable to that of Florus.</p>
 <p>The value of Justin's history chiefly depends on the circumstance of Trogus's work having been 
<pb n="904" /><cb />
 compiled from some of the best of the ancient historical writers, such as Theopompus, Herodotus, Ctesias, Hieronymus of Cardia, Timaeus, Phylarchus, Polybius, Posidonius, etc.</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages the work of Justin was much read and copied, though not used in schools. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> appeared at Venice and Rome in 1470. Good editions are those of Fittbogen, with notes <bibl default="NO">(Halle, 1835)</bibl>, Johanneau and Dübner, revised by Jeep <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1860)</bibl>, with critical commentary, and Rühl <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1886)</bibl>.

 <p>The fourth in order of time and of literary development of the great writers of Roman satire, his predecessors being Lucilius, Horace, and Persius. Of his life there are known but few particulars. His ancient biographers relate that he was either the son or foster-son of a rich freedman, and was born at Aquinum (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  3. 319" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 319</bibl>) at a date that can not be determined, but which may be approximately given as between A.D. 57 and 67. He is said to have studied rhetoric, and began writing satire not earlier than A.D. 100, for in his first <cb /> satire (i. 49) he mentions the exile of Marius Priscus, which took place in that year. He lived a simple life at his country estate near Tibur (xi. 65). He tells us himself that he visited Egypt at some period of his life; and according to an inscription dedicated by him to Ceres Helvina, found at Aquinum, he held at various times the offices of tribune of a cohort, duumvir of Aquinum, and <seg lang="la">flamen. </seg> (<title>C. I. L.</title> x. 5382). Tradition explains his military office and his visit to Egypt as having been in reality a form of exile for having attacked the imperial favourite, Paris, in his satires (cf. Sidon. Apoll. viii. 270). Another tradition makes Britain to have been his place of exile. Of the date and place of his death, nothing is known; but he must have died later than A.D. 127, as he mentions Aemilius Iunius (xv. 27). He was a friend of Martial, who speaks of him in friendly terms (vii. 24 and 91; xii. 18).</p>
 <p>There remain to us sixteen satires of Juvenal, the last of which is probably a fragment, and is by some regarded as spurious. All are written in dactylic hexameters. They represent the final development of satire among the Romans, and answer the modern definition of satiric composition, being passionate, scornful, and filled with the language of indignant denunciation and bitter invective. His subject is not, as with Horace, the foibles and venial follies of the age, but those darker vices whose prevalence taints the history of the times in which he wrote. His tone is, therefore, not that of the indulgent man of the world, but of the stern censor who hates the hideous sins that he looks upon, and scourges them with a whip of scorpions. Yet there is much of the rhetorician's exaggeration in his invective, and it may be questioned whether the passion is not partly simulated. Moreover, the painful minuteness with which he draws the details of abnormal vice, and the excessive crudity of his language in at least two of the satires (the Second and Sixth) seem inconsistent with the professed morality of the writer, and excite a strong suspicion of pruriency. He is at his best in the Third and Tenth, in which he touches the less loathsome faults of contemporary Rome, and where one finds here and there a noble bit of poetry. It is these two satires that Dr. Samuel Johnson paraphrased in English in his two poems, <title>London</title> and <title>The Vanity of Human Riches</title>, with a fire and force and epigrammatic terseness of language that are in no respect inferior to the original. Juvenal is very modern in his mental attitude as well as in his phrasing. An English scholar has recently declared that we are to see in him the first instances in literature of American humour—the humour that derives its effect from bringing together unexpectedly two ludicrously inappropriate ideas, or in applying to the most solemn subjects the familiar language of every-day life. In this, Juvenal has been hailed as the prototype of Hosea Biglow and Mark Twain; and his “waxing over the knees of the gods” and his offering “the sacred sausages of a little white pig” have perhaps to many obscured the other passages of great nobility and beauty that are not far to seek. Of pregnant phrases and epigrammatic sentences, he has made some striking contributions to literature.
 <quote lang="la">Probitas laudatur et alget — facit indignatio versum—res angusta domi — scribendi cacoëthes — stemmata quid faciunt? — Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator — Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano — Maxima debetur puero rererentia</quote> — are perhaps the most famous of his many famous epigrams.

<head orig="Ixīon">Ixion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰξίων</foreign>). The son of Antion or Peision, or, according to some, of Phlegyas. Others, again, <cb /> gave him the god Ares for a father. He obtained the hand of Dia, the daughter of Deīoueus, having promised his father-in-law large gifts; but he did not keep his agreement and Deïoneus seizing his horses detained them as a pledge. Ixion then sent messengers to say that the gifts were ready if he would come to bring them. Deloneus accordingly came, but his treacherous son-in-law had prepared in his house a pit filled with fire and carefully covered over, into which the unsuspecting man fell and perished. After this deed Ixion was stricken with madness, and the atrocity of his crime was such that neither gods nor men would absolve him, till at length Zeus took pity on him and purified him, and admitted him to Olympus. Here again, incapable of good, Ixion cast a lustful eye on Heré, the wife of his divine benefactor. She, however, in concert with Zeus, formed a cloud in the likeness of herself, which Ixion embraced. Having boasted of his good-fortune, Zeus precipitated him into Erebus, where Hermes fastened him with brazen bands to an ever-revolving fiery wheel, lying upon which he is forever seourged and forced to cry out “Benefactors should be honoured!” The offspring of Ixion and the cloud was a son, Centaurus, who afterwards, having intercourse with the mares of Maguesia, begot the race of centaurs. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscentauri">Centauri</ref>.</p>
 <p>The myth of Ixion is probably of great antiqnity, as the customs on which it is founded only prevailed in the Heroic Age. Its chief object seems to have been to inspire a horror of the violation of hospitality on the part of those who, having committed homicide, were admitted to the house and table of the one who had consented to perform the rites by which the guilt of the offender was supposed to be removed. On Ixion, see the poem by Robert Browning in his <title>Jocoseria.</title>

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
