<div2 id="crosscabeiria" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cabeiria">Cabeiria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ καβείρια</foreign>). The mysterious rites of the Pelasgic gods known as the Cabeiri, celebrated in the islands lying between Euboea and the Hellespont, in Lemnos, Imbros, and especially in Samothrace. This worship was also known on the adjacent coasts of Europe and Asia Minor, at Thebes and Andania in Greece, and, according to Strabo (iv. p. 198), in an island near Britannia. Like the Elensinia, an almost complete secrecy had been maintained as to the ceremonies and teaching of these mysteries. Yet we know the names of the gods; and, from an examination of the various forms under which we find them, Lenormant has been able to discover what he calls a Cabeiric group. They are four in number, thus differing essentially from the Phoenician Kabirim, who, as their Semitic name shows, are also “great gods,” but are eight in number, representing the planets and the universe formed from their union. The names of the Samothracian Cabeiri, as revealed by Mnaseas of Patara and Dionysodorus, two historians <cb /> of the Alexandrian Age, are Axieros (=Demeter), Axiokersa (=Persephoné), Axiokersos (=Hades), Casmilos (=Hermes). (See the scholiast on <bibl n="A. R. 1.917" default="NO" valid="yes">Apoll. Rhod. i. 917.</bibl>) Sometimes the two goddesses blend in one, viz. Earth (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 58); sometimes as Aphrodité and Venus; but to most of the Romans they represent Iuno and Minerva ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 3. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>iii. 12</bibl>). Axiokersos appears further as Zeus, Uranus, Iupiter, Apollo, Dionysus-Liber; and Casmilos as Mercurius or Eros. The group is a primal mother goddess, whose issue are two divinities, a male and a female, from whom again springs a fourth, Casmilos, the orderer of the universe. For a full discussion of the varied evidence on which this grouping is made, the reader is referred to Lenormant in Daremberg and Saglio, i. 757 foll.</p>
 <p>Herodotus (ii. 51) is the first historian who mentions them. Though known while Athens was flourishing ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 277" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 277</bibl>), it was not till Alexandrian times that they really became famous. During this period Samothrace was a sort of sacred island, as it was under the Roman dominion, for the idea was prevalent that the Penates ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 2. 325" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>ii. 325</bibl><bibl n="Verg. A. 3. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. Aen., iii. 12</bibl><bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 619" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. Aen., viii. 619</bibl>) were identical with the gods of Samothrace. Legend told how that Dardanus, Eetion, or Iasion, and Harmonia, wife of Cadmus, were children of Electra and Zeus; that Iasion was given the mysteries by Zeus, married Cybelé, and begat Corybas; and after Iasion was received among the gods, Dardanus, Cybelé, and Corybas brought the mysteries to Asia. The legends vary in details, but almost all agree in making Dardanus and Iasion sons of Zeus and Electra, and connecting the Samothracian mysteries with them. It is to be remarked, in passing, that, while legend brought the mysteries from Samothrace to Asia, there can be hardly any doubt that the passage was the other way (cf. Strabo, x. 472); for the whole tenor of the worship is Asiatic. We have many inscriptions of Romans who were initiated (<title>C. I. L.</title> iii. 713-721), and we hear besides of other Romans of high position who were initiated, among them probably Cicero (<title>Nat. Deor.</title> i. 42, 119). Throughout the Roman period the Cabeiric mysteries were held in high estimation, second only to the Eleusinian, and they were still in existence in the time of Libanius.</p>
 <p>From the earliest times, the Pelasgi are said to have sacrificed a tenth of their produce to the Cabeiri in order to be preserved from famine. The chief priest was probably the <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροφάντης</foreign> mentioned by Galen (iii. 576, ed. Kühn); and the purifying priest <foreign lang="greek">κόης</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κοίης</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">βασιλεύς</foreign> of the inscriptions was the highest eponymous magistrate of Samothrace. As in all mysteries, the votary must be purified in body and mind before initiation; and thus we have some evidence of auricular confession. But, as far as we know, there was not any special preparatory intellectual training required. Women and children appear to have been admitted as well as men. Of the religious ceremonies themselves we may say we know nothing. They consisted of <foreign lang="greek">δρώμενα καὶ λεγόμενα</foreign>. We hear of dances by the <title>pii Samothraces</title>, and the priests who executed these dances were called Saoi (?). The Romans, who traced their Penates to Samothrace, referred their Salii to these Saoi. There were two classes of votaries— the <foreign lang="greek">μύσται</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">μύσται εὐσεβεῖς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">mystae pii</seg>—the 
<pb n="238" /><cb />
 latter being apparently those initiated for the first time. In the Samothracian mysteries, <seg lang="la">sacra accipere</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">παραλαμβάνειν τὰ μυστήρια</foreign>), which is the regular phrase for primary initiation, seems to be applied to the higher grades. But the whole matter is quite obscure and unsettled. See Hirschfeld in Conze, <title>Untersuchungen auf Samothrake</title>, pp. 37-39.</p>
 <p>The scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius tells us that the initiated wore a purple band (<foreign lang="greek">ταινία</foreign>) round their waist (which reminds us of the Brahminical thread); that Agamemnon quelled a mutiny of the Greeks by wearing one; and that Odysseus, who wore a fillet for the band, was miraculously saved in shipwreck. Preservation in times of peril, and especially in perils on the sea, was the chief service that the Cabeiri were supposed to render to those who called on them by name, and none knew their names except the initiated. It was the electric fires of the Cabeiri that, according to the legend, lighted on the heads of the Dioscuri during the Argonautic voyage. Diodorus further says, in the course of an important discussion on the Cabeiri (v. 47-49), that those who were initiated became more pious, more righteous, and in every respect better than they were before. On the basis of this, Lenormant thinks it probable that the doctrine of rewards and punishments in a future life was inculcated, though, with Lobeck, we may well suppose that no more is necessarily implied than the impulse to virtue, which is always united with religious emotion excited by impressive and gracious ceremonies. (Cf. <bibl n="A. R. 1.917" default="NO" valid="yes">Apoll. Rhod. i. 917</bibl>.)</p>
 <p>The initiations at Samothrace took place at any time from May to September (see inscriptions), in this differing from the Eleusinian and more resembling the Orphic Mysteries. There appears, however, to have been a specially great ceremony at the commencement of August ( <title>Lucull.</title> 13).</p>
 <p>From the manner in which Cicero speaks of the Samothracian mysteries in the passage already cited, it is probable that he was initiated. He says of their ceremonies, <seg lang="la">quibus explicatis ad rationemque revocatis, rerum magis natura cognoscitur quam deorum.</seg> And the Cabeiri themselves do appear to be symbols of the creation of the world. From the primeval mother emanate or differentiate themselves two elements—matter (earth) and force (especially fire, celestial and terrestrial). Indeed, the name Cabeiri appears to mean “the Burners,” from <foreign lang="greek">καίειν</foreign> (see Welcker, <title>Die Aeschyl. Trilogie</title>, pp. 161, 211), and by the action of the former on the latter the ordered world is generated. The etymological identity of the Pelasgian with the Phoenician Cabeiri is doubted by Lenormant; the name of the latter being from a Semitic root, which in Arabic appears as <hi rend="italic">kebir</hi>, “great.” Many hold that all the ceremonies of the Cabeiri, and those of the other mysteries, were pure inventions of the priests, nothing more than mere stories about gods. The reader, with regard to this phase of the subject, is referred to the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmysteria">Mysteria</ref>.</p>

 <p> A sister of <ref type="cross" target="crosscacus">Cacus</ref> (q.v.), who, according to one version of the fable, became enamoured of Hercules, and showed the hero where her brother had concealed his oxen. For this she was deified. She presided over the excrements of the human body (cf. the verb <seg lang="la">cacare</seg>) and had a chapel (<seg lang="la">sacellum</seg>) at Rome, with a sacred fire continually burning in it, and virgins to perform her rites (Lactant. i. 20, p. 110, ed.

</figure> The Greek forms <foreign lang="greek">κακκάβη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κάκκαβος</foreign> both occur in the Comic Fragments, and the former is as old as Aristophanes.</p>
 <p>The different processes of boiling and frying are not always clearly distinguished in the ancient kitchen. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssartago">Sartago</ref>.) It seems certain, however, that the caccabus was used for boiling meat, vegetables, etc.; and that it was placed immediately upon the fire, or upon a trivet (<hi rend="italic">tripus</hi>) standing over it. It is thus distinguished from the <seg lang="la">aenum</seg>, which was suspended over the fire ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg.

<div2 id="crosskakosis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Kakōsis">Kakosis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign>). In the Attic law, <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign> signifies one of the following kinds of ill-treatment:</p>
 <p>(1) The ill-treatment of parents by their children (<foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις γονέων</foreign>), the term <foreign lang="greek">γονεῖς</foreign> including also grandparents and great-grandparents. Refusal to supply the parents with means of support or to bury them with proper honours at death, equally with actual abuse or disobedience, formed instances of <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign>. An illegitimate child, however, was not liable to this action.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Infidelity or ill-treatment of wives by their husbands (<foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις γυναικῶν</foreign>), including also the neglect of the law of Solon by which the husband 
<pb n="239" /><cb />
 was bound to visit his wife three times every month, at least, if she were an heiress ( <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>30</bibl>). In the comedy of Cratinus, called the <title>Wine Flask</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πυτίνη</foreign>), Comedy was represented as the wife of Cratinus, who brought an action against him because he neglected her and devoted all his attention to the wine-flask (Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Equit.</title> 399).
 </p>
 <p>(3) Injury committed against orphans or widows (<foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις τῶν ὀρφανῶν καὶ χηρευουσῶν γυναικῶν</foreign>), who were all considered to be under the especial protection of the chief archon.</p>
 <p>All cases of <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign> belonged to the jurisdiction of the chief archon in the case of citizens, or to the polemarch in the case of <seg lang="la">metoeci</seg> (Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 269; Perrot, <title>Essai sur le Droit Public</title>, p. 264). If a person wronged in any way orphans, heiresses, or widows, the archon could inflict a fine himself; or, if he considered the person deserving of greater punishment, could bring him before the Heliaea. Any private individual could also accuse parties guilty of <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign> by means of laying an information (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγγελία</foreign>) before the chief archon, though sometimes the accuser proceeded by means of a regular indictment (<foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign>), with an <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign> before the archon.

 <p> In Italian mythology, a fire-spitting giant, the son of Vulcan, who lived near the place where Rome was afterwards built. When Hercules came into the neighbourhood with the cattle of Geryon, Cacus stole some of them while the hero was sleeping and dragged them backwards into his cave under a spur of the Aventine, so that their footprints gave no clue to the direction in which they had gone. He then closed the entrance to the cave with a rock, which ten pairs of oxen were unable to move. But the lowing of the cattle guided the hero, in his search, to the right track. He tore open the cave, and, after a fearful struggle, slew Cacus with his club (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 543" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 543</bibl> foll). Upon this he built an altar on the spot to Iupiter, under the title of Pater Inventor, “the discoverer,” and sacrificed one of the cattle upon it. The inhabitants paid him every honour for freeing them of the monster; and Evander, who had been instructed by his mother, Carmentis, in the lore of prophecy, saluted him as a god. Hercules is then said to have established his own religious service, and to have instructed two noble families, the Potitii and the Pinarii, in the usages to be observed at the sacrifice (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 7</bibl>). This sacrifice was to be offered on the Ara Maxima, <cb /> which he himself had built on the cattle-market (<title>Forum Boarium</title>) where the cattle had been pastured.

<head orig="Cadmus">Cadmus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κάδμος</foreign>). (1) The son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia, and of Telephassa. His sister Europa being carried off by Zeus, Cadmus, with his brothers Phoenix and Cilix, was sent out with the command to look for her, and not to return without her. In the course of his wanderings he came to Thrace. Here his mother, who had accompanied him so far, breathed her last; and Cadmus applied for counsel to the Delphic oracle. He was advised not to seek his sister any more, but to follow a cow which would meet him, and found a city on the spot where she should lie down. The cow met him in Phocis, and led him into Boeotia. He was intending to sacrifice the cow, and had sent his companions to a neighbouring spring to bring the necessary water, when they were all slain by a serpent, the offspring of Ares and the Erinys Tisiphoné, that guarded the spring. After a severe struggle, Cadmus destroyed the dragon, and at the command of Athené sowed its teeth over the neighbouring ground. A host of armed men sprang up, who immediately fought and slew each other, all except five. The survivors, who were called Spartoi, “sown,” helped Cadmus to build the Cadmea, or the stronghold of what was afterwards Thebes, which bore his name. They were the ancestors of the Theban aristocracy; and one of them, Echion, “the serpent's son,” became the husband of Cadmus's daughter, Agavé. Cadmus did atonement to Ares for eight years for the slaughter of the dragon. Then Zeus gave him to wife Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodité, who bore him a son, Polydorus, and four daughters, Autonoé, Ino, Agavé, and Semelé. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossharmonia">Harmonia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssemele">Semelé</ref>.) Crushed by the terrible doom which weighed upon his home, he afterwards sought retirement among the Euchelii in Illyria, a country which he named after his son Illyrius, who was born there. He resigned the kingdom to Illyrius; and then he and his wife Harmonia were changed into serpents, and carried by Zeus to Elysium.</p>
 <p>The ancient tradition was that Cadmus brought sixteen letters from Phoenicia to Greece, to which Palamedes added subsequently four more, <foreign lang="greek">θ, ξ, φ, χ</foreign>, and Simonides, at a still later period, four others, <foreign lang="greek">ζ, η, ψ, ω.</foreign> The traditional alphabet of Cadmus is supposed to have been the following: <foreign lang="greek">Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Φ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ</foreign>, and the names were, <foreign lang="greek">Ἄλφα, Βῆτα, Γάμμα, Δέλτα, Εἶ, Φαῦ, Ἰῶτα, Κάππα, Λάμβδα, Μῦ, Νῦ, Οῦ, Πῖ, Ῥῶ, Ζίγμα, Ταῦ</foreign>. The explanation which has just been given to the myth of Cadmus, and its connection with the Pelasgi, have an important bearing on the question relative to the existence of an early Pelasgic alphabet in Greece.

</figure> The caduceus was originally only an olive-branch with garlands, which were afterwards formed into snakes.

 <p>From caduceus was formed the word <seg lang="la">caduceator</seg>, which signified a person sent to treat of peace. Thus Aulus Gellius tells us that Q.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Statius Caecilius.</hi> A writer of Latin comedy. He was a Gaul, of the race of the Insubrians, who were settled in Upper Italy, and was brought to Rome, probably about B.C. 194, as a prisoner of war. He was set free by one of the Caecilii, became very intimate with Ennius, and died not long after him, B.C. 166. It was long before he could obtain a footing on the stage; but, this once achieved, he won a considerable reputation, and was numbered among the masters of his craft. The influence of Ennius seems to have been apparent in the comparative care and regularity with which his pieces were constructed. Cicero, however, finds fault with his defective Latinity ( <title>Ad Att.</title> vii. 3, 10); and we must therefore infer that, being of foreign extraction, he never succeeded in fully mastering the niceties of colloquial Latin. The titles of some forty of his plays have survived. The contents he mostly borrowed from Menander, and sixteen of his titles are those of plays of Menander.

<div2 id="crosscaelatura" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Caelatūra">Caelatura</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τορευτική</foreign>). Both the Greek and the Roman name come from the words denoting in the two languages “the graver's tool” (<seg lang="la">caelum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">τορεύς</foreign>); and in its general sense <seg lang="la">caelatura</seg> may be taken as meaning the arts employed in the production of ornamental works in metal, both in relief and in intaglio, including repoussé work, chasing, and engraving, but excluding statuary. See <ref type="cross" target="crossstatuaria-ars">Statuaria Ars</ref>.</p>
 <p>The chief literary source of our information regarding the toreutic art is Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  154" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 154</bibl>-157); and a complete list of the passages in the ancient writers, referring to this art, has been made by Overbeck in his <title>Antiken Schriftquellen</title>, s. v. “Toreutik.” It is, however, from the artistic remains of antiquity that its history can best be studied—remains that are magnificently represented in the great museums of Europe.</p>
 <p>The earliest specimens of ornamental metalwork discovered on Greek soil are those found by Dr. Schliemann at Hissarlik in the Troad, consisting of a large number of objects in gold, such as bracelets, ear-rings, and diadems. Among the specimens, of which a detailed description will be found in Schliemann's <bibl default="NO"><title>Ilios</title> (London and N. Y., 1880)</bibl>, may be mentioned the following: bracelets, consisting of a thick gold plate piped with wire and adorned with spiral ornaments of gold wire soldered on the plate; a diadem, composed principally of hexagonal leaves of gold; hair-pins, consisting of a quadrangular plate ornamented with spirals of gold wires soldered on like the bracelets just mentioned; <cb /> <figure id="fig.00241.2"><head>Gold Diadem from the so-called Treasure of Priam, as actually worn. (Schliemann, <title>Ilios</title>, p. 458.)</head></figure> gold disks, of which one represents a flower of star form, in repoussé work. The appellation “Treasure of Priam” given by the discoverer to a large class of these objects is misleading, inasmuch as the art described in the Homeric poems is quite certainly of a more advanced character. The Hissarlik metal-work is, in fact, the product of a halfbarbarous people, and its simple and unambitious character may be discerned in the preference for such ornamentation as the spiral (a form which is naturally suggested by the curling of gold wire) and in the infrequent representations of animal forms. An early though more advanced style is represented by the objects discovered by Schliemann at Mycenae, which may be approximately assigned to a date not later than B.C. 1000. The Mycenaean objects are, on the whole, the work of rude local artists, scarcely touched as yet by Oriental influence. The specimens in gold, which are extremely numerous, consist principally of plaques in repoussé work, bowls, diadems, and sepulchral masks rudely imitating the human countenance. Round bosses and other circular patterns, and especially combinations of spirals, are the basis of most of the patterns, but floral forms and imitations of insects and of marine life are also employed. Among the most instructive objects may be mentioned the following: (1) Gold diadems found on the heads of corpses. The diadems are generally piped with copper wire to give them greater solidity.</p>
 <p>(2) Lozenge-shaped buttons of wood plated with gold, ornamented with intaglio and repoussé work.</p>
 <p>(3) Perforated ornaments of gold with engravings in intaglio.</p>
 <p>(4) Gold cylinder adorned with rock crystal; a dragon of gold with scales of rock crystal.</p>
 <p>(5) Scabbards of 
<pb n="242" /><cb />
 swords, representing a lion-hunt, winged monsters, fish, and plants. The manes of the lions are of red gold, the bodies of a paler tint in the same metal. A distinction of colour is also observed between the sea and the fish swimming in it, and further variety is obtained by the use of enamel in the background.</p>
 <p>The next important epoch in the history of our subject has been denominated the Graeco-Phoenician, an epoch when the rude genius of the Greeks set itself to learn in the comparatively advanced artistic school of the Phoenicians. This is the period of art described, though with some poetic embellishment, in the Homeric poems, in which compositions the higher works of metallic art are spoken of as coming from a foreign and especially a Phoenician source. Thus it is from the king of Cyprus that Agamemnon receives the present of his cuirass ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 19" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 19</bibl>), and from Egypt that Menelaüs brings back tripods and the basket of Helen ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 126" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 126</bibl> foll.). The crater destined by Menelaüs for Telemachus comes to him from the king of the Sidonians ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 616" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 616</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 741" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 741</bibl>), and it is the Sidonians who made the silver crater given by Achilles as a prize at the Funeral Games. Even the elaborate Homeric description of the shield of Achilles may be shown to have had a tangible basis in works of Phoenician art. This Phoenician art, as revealed to us by the archaeological discoveries of recent years, was not in itself original, but was formed by a curious blending of the art of the Egyptians and the Assyrians. It may best be studied in the numerous metal bowls that have been found in several localities, especially Cyprus and Italy, which had in early days relations with the Phoenician traders. The epoch generally assigned for the execution of these bowls is the seventh or eighth century B.C., though the manufacture of them according to traditional patterns may have continued to a later period. In the artistic designs of these vessels it is especially important to note the arrangement of the subjects in concentric zones, and the frequent mingling of Assyrian and Egyptian elements. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyprus">Cyprus</ref>.</p>
 <p>As specimens of early jewelry we may refer to the objects of gold (now in the Louvre and the British Museum) found by Salzmann at Camirus in Rhodes, which may be regarded as products of Phoenician art in the eighth century B.C. As an example of these we may take the pale gold plaques which belonged to a necklace and which are embossed with the alternate designs of a Centaur of primitive type with Egyptian head-dress, seizing a hind, and a winged female figure (the goddess Artemis or Anaïtis) holding a lion and a panther. Another plate is ornamented with a recumbent lion of Assyrian style: the mane is formed by massing together minute granules of gold, while the ears are marked out by lines formed of similar granules. On the same plaque is the head of an eagle, adorned, like the lion, with granulated designs. From the plaque itself are suspended pomegranates, chainlets, and heads of Egyptian style. Of early jewelry found in Greece proper we may notice the gold studs or ear-rings discovered in 1860 at Megara: they are decorated in repoussé, with human heads of Egyptian character, facing. Another interesting specimen of archaic jewelry, stated to have been found at Athens, and belonging probably to the first half of the sixth <cb /> century B.C., is an ear-ring published in the <title>Journal of Hellenic Studies</title> (vol. ii. p. 324), on the oblong pendant of which is represented side by side a pair of female figures, beaten out in relief. The arms of both these figures are straightened closely to their sides, and their dress and attitude, though very archaic, present a resemblance to the Canephori of the Erechtheum. <figure id="fig.00242">

 <p>Our knowledge of the jewelry of the fine period of Greek art is mainly derived from two great sources—the excavations in the tombs of southern Russia and in those of Etruria. Of the Etruscan jewelry, the Louvre, the Vatican, and the British Museum possess numerous and choice examples. The objects from southern Russia, which belong to a great extent to the fourth century B.C., are now in the Museum of the Hermitage, and may be studied in the elaborate <title>Comptes Rendus de la Commission Archéologique de St.-Pétersbourg</title>, and in the 
<pb n="243" /><cb /> <title>Antiquités du Bosphore Cimmérien.</title> The great European jewel-collections contain specimens, unrivalled in workmanship, of all the various objects of personal adornment—necklaces with pendants, ear-rings, bracelets, brooches, etc. The main effect in this jewelry is due to the combination of small figures and flowers in repoussé work, with fine filigree, grannlated patterns, and vitreous inlays. Precious stones, such as garnets, are sometimes introduced, but in the best age the jeweller made comparatively little use of them. The ancient jeweller is distinguished by his delicate manipulation of the gold, his mastery of modelling, his extraordinary minuteness of work, and by the technical skill which produced the granulation (i.e. the soldering of extremely minute particles of gold on a leaf of gold) which is especially noticeable in the jewelry of Etruria. This Etruscan jewelry in its earlier period betrays an Oriental influence, but is in its later and finest stage so thoroughly Greek in character as to be a fair exponent of the capabilities of the Greek jewellers. For details as to the form of the various objects of personal ornament, the reader is referred to the separate articles in this dictionary; but as furnishing a sample of the fertile invention and surpassing skill of the Greek workman, we may here refer to two classes of ear-rings, of which there are good specimens in the GoldOrnament Room of the British Museum. The first <figure id="fig.00243">
<head orig="Etruscan Necklace from Tarentum (B.C. 600). (In the Castellani Collection, British Museum.)">Etruscan Necklace from Tarentum (B.C. 600). (In the Castellani Collection, British Museum.)</head>
</figure> class, which is the simpler and perhaps somewhat the earlier in date, consists of ear-rings formed of twisted wire and terminating at one end in the head of an animal, especially a lion. The second class consists of the specimens attached to the ear by a hook, which is covered by a round disk. The disk itself is generally adorned with some subject suitable for a medallion, such as a full face in relief, and beneath it are suspended one or more small figures. For these pendants Victories are often chosen, and an especial favourite is a tiny figure of Eros holding various objects, such as a scroll or a musical instrument. As exquisite specimens may be noticed a pair (<title>Comptes Rendus de la Comm. Arch. de St.Pétersb.</title>, 1870-71, pl. vi., figs. 11, 12) composed of a rosette, from which hang three chains, the two outermost terminating in pendants: from the middle chain hangs a goose, inlaid about the feathers with granulated work. In the centre of the rosette is a garnet, from which radiate leaves in blue enamel, forming a star pattern. <cb /></p>
 <p>The beautiful gold necklace shown in the illustration given below forms part of the Castellani Collection in the British Museum. It consists of a circlet of roses bearing alternate pendants of vases and female heads, all exquisitely modelled. The roses are each composed of three rosettes of diminishing sizes superimposed. Of the pendants, the centre head is simply that of a beautiful girl, while the two on each side of it have cows' horns and ears, and represent Io, who was changed by Zeus into a cow.</p>
 <p>A very fine specimen of jewelry not intended for wear is the votive gold crown found at Armento, and now at Munich. It is composed of branches of oak intertwined with garlands of flowers, while winged figures are placed amid the foliage.</p>
 <p>Another important branch of the toreutic art is constituted by the production of gold and silver vases, elaborately adorned—generally with reliefs in repoussé, or with ornaments separately made and soldered or riveted to the vessel. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscrusta">Crusta</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossemblema">Emblema;</ref> and cf.  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  139" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H.

With the increase of luxury under the successors of Alexander, this branch of art began to assume especial prominence. (Cf. Athenaeus, v. 29, 30;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  154" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 154</bibl>, etc.) Among the more important vessels in the precious metals now extant should be mentioned the following: (1) The magnificent silver vase in the Hermitage Museum, which was found in the tomb of a Scythian king at Nicopolis. It has the form of an amphora, and on its upper part are friezes of Scythians and animals, in high-relief; leaves and flowers adorning the body of the vessel. The decoration is partly in repoussé, and partly consists in ornaments, like the lion-masks and the head of a winged horse, separately made and gilded and then soldered on. This vase has been assigned to the fourth century B.C.</p>
 <p>(2) Silver vase in the Antiquarium of Munich, ornamented externally with a circular frieze, in which are represented Trojan captives, in low relief.</p>
 <p>(3) The Corsini vase, on which see the memoir by Michaelis, <title>Das Corsinische Silbergefäss.</title></p>
 <p>(4) Specimens in the Berlin Museum from the silver treasure found near Hildesheim (Hanover) in 1885, some of which go back to the time of Augustus or earlier. They have much executional merit, but present the Roman characteristics of exuberant ornament and exaggerated

 relief.</p>
 <p>(5) Specimens in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, from the treasure discovered at Bernay in France. The vases are of varying merit, and differ in date—one class being ornamented in very prominent repoussé, the other in lower relief with slight and delicate lines.</p>
 <p>(6) The gold patera of Rennes, into which are inserted gold coins ranging from Hadrian to Geta. The bottom of the vase is adorned with a large medallion executed in repoussé, and bordered by a wreath of laurel leaves in low-relief.</p>
 <p>(7) Silver vases found at Pompeii, and now in the Museum at Naples. This list may be concluded with a reference to the specimens in the celebrated silver treasure discovered at Rome in 1793, and now in the British Museum. It consists of caskets, vases, trappings, and ornaments of silver, and was probably executed for the most part about the end of the fifth century A.D. The figures and ornaments on most of the objects are generally embossed and chased, and gilding is applied to the salient parts. The figures, as might be expected at so late a period, are coarsely executed and of clumsy proportions.</p>
 <p>To the examples of ornamental metal-work which have now been mentioned in this article, and which are principally in gold and silver, must be added certain specimens in bronze which are adorned (1) with engraved designs,</p>
 <p>(2) with figures in relief. A remarkable specimen of archaic Greek engraving is found on the bronze cuirass discovered in the bed of the Alpheus, and photographed in the <bibl default="NO"><title>Bulletin de Corr. Hell.</title> (1883)</bibl>, p. 1, pl. i.-iii. Besides figures of animals, the design shows a group of six human figures. Engraved designs occur most frequently upon the circular metal disks used as mirrors by the ancients, the largest class of which comes from Etruria. Though on some of the Etruscan mirrors the drawings are of a masterly character, the greater number are executed loosely and without much regard to beauty of composition. See <ref type="cross" target="crossspeculum">Speculum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The covers of the mirrors of box-like form— mostly found in Greece proper—offer favourable specimens of reliefs executed in bronze. Several of them belong to a good period of Greek art; their subjects, as a rule, are borrowed from the cycles of Aphrodité and of Dionysus. Fine examples of Greek repoussé work in bronze are also to be seen in the plaques with figures in relief, which <cb /> once served to ornament armour or other objects.</p>
 <p>Engravings on mirrors of purely Greek work are rare. Among the most beautiful examples may be cited the mirror representing the Genius of the Cock Fights (Musée de Lyon), and the specimen with the hero Corinthus crowned by a woman who personifies the Corinthian colony of Leucas.</p>

<head orig="Caeré">Caere</head>

 <p> (always called by the Greek writers <foreign lang="greek">Ἄγυλλα</foreign>). One of the most considerable cities of Etruria, and universally acknowledged to have been founded by the Tyrrhenian Pelasgi (<bibl n="D. H. 1. 20" default="NO">Dion. Hal.i. 20</bibl>; iii. 60). It was situated near the coast, to the west of Veii. Ancient writers seem puzzled to account for the change of name which this city is allowed to have undergone, the Romans never calling it anything but Caeré, except Vergil ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 478" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>viii. 478</bibl>). Strabo relates that the Tyrrheni, on arriving before this city, were hailed by the Pelasgi from the walls with the word <foreign lang="greek">Χαῖρε</foreign>, according to the Greek mode of salutation; and that, when they had made themselves masters of the place, they changed its name to that form of greeting. Other variations of this story may be seen in <cb /> Servius (<title>ad Aen.</title> viii. 597). According to one of them, given on the authority of Hyginus, the Romans, and not the Lydians, changed its name from Agylla to Caeré. All these explanations, however, are unsatisfactory. It has been supposed that Caeré might be the original name, or perhaps that which the Siculi, the ancient possessors, gave to the place before the Pelasgic invasion. According to Müller (<title>Die Etrusker</title>, vol. i. p. 87), the two names for the place point to two different stems or races of inhabitants. This same writer makes the genuine Etrurian name to have been Cisra.</p>
 <p>The earliest record to be found of the history of Agylla is in Herodotus (i. 167). That writer informs us that the Phocaeans, having been driven from their native city on the shores of Ionia by the arms of Cyrus, formed establishments in Corsica, of which the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians, jealous of their nautical skill and enterprising spirit, sought to dispossess them. A severe action accordingly took place in the Sea of Sardinia, between the Phocaeans and the combined fleet of the latter powers, in which the former gained the day; but it was such a victory as left them little room for exultation, they having lost several of their ships, and the rest being nearly all disabled. The Agylleans, who appear to have constituted the principal force of the Tyrrhenians, on their return home landed their prisoners and stoned them to death; for which act of cruelty they were soon visited by a strange calamity. It was observed that all the living creatures which approached the spot where the Phocaeans had been murdered were immediately seized with convulsive distortions and paralytic affections of the limbs. On consulting the oracle at Delphi, to learn how they might expiate their offence, the Agylleans were commanded to celebrate the obsequies of the dead and to hold games in their honour; which order, the historian informs us, was punctually attended to up to his time. We learn also from Strabo that the Agylleans always abstained from piracy, to which the other Tyrrhenian cities were much addicted. According to Dionysius, the Romans were first engaged in hostilities with Caeré under the reign of Tarquin the Elder, and subsequently under Servius Tullius, by whom a treaty was concluded between the two States (iii. 28). Long after, when Rome had been taken by the Gauls, the inhabitants of Caeré rendered the former city an important service by receiving their priests and Vestals, and defeating the Gauls on their return through the Sabine territory; on which occasion they recovered the gold with which Rome is said to have purchased its liberation. This is a curious fact, and not mentioned by any historian; but it agrees very well with the account which Polybius gives us of the retreat of the Gauls (i. 6). In return for this assistance, the Romans requited the Caerites by declaring them the public guests of Rome, and admitting them, though not in full, to the rights enjoyed by her citizens. They were made citizens, but without the right of voting; whence the phrases, <title>in Caeritum tabulas referre aliquem</title>, “to deprive one of his right of voting,” and <title>Caerite cera digni</title>, “worthless persons,” in reference to citizens of Rome, since what would be an honour to the people of Caeré would be a punishment to a native Roman citizen. See Hor. <title>Epist.</title> i. 6, 62, with the commentators.

<head orig="Caesar">Caesar</head>

 <p> A title of the Roman emperors, and originally a family name of the gens Iulia. It was assumed by Octavianus as the adopted son of the great dictator, C. Iulius Caesar, and was by him handed down to his adopted son Tiberius. It continued to be used by Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, as members either by adoption or female descent of Caesar's family; but though the family became extinct with Nero, succeeding emperors still retained the name as part of their titles, and it was the practice to prefix it to their own names, as, for instance, <title>Imperator Caesar Domitianus Augustus.</title> When Hadrian adopted Aelius Verus, he allowed the latter to take the title of Caesar ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Ael. Ver. 1" default="NO">Spart. <title>Ael. Ver.</title>1</bibl>); and from this time, though the title of <title>Augustus</title> continued to be confined to the reigning emperor, that of <title>Caesar</title> was also granted the second person in the State and the heir-presumptive to the throne. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugustus">Augustus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The name <title>Caesar</title> was variously derived by the ancients, some assigning it directly to <seg lang="la">caedo</seg>, to denote that the first bearer of the name was cut from his mother's uterus by the “Caesarian” operation ( <bibl n="Plin.

Doederlein (<title>Synon.</title> iii. 17) assigns it to <seg lang="la">caesius</seg>, as applied to the colour of the skin, or perhaps of the eyes.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crosscaesar2" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Caesar</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Iulius</foreName>
 <p>, or, as the name is written in English, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Julius Caesar</hi>, was born on the 12th of July, in B.C. 102 or 100. The latter date rests upon the statement of several ancient authorities, but Mommsen has shown that the earlier date is more probably correct. The Caesar family was of patrician stock. It belonged to the proud gens of the Iulii, who traced their ancestry back to the very beginning of Roman history. In the century between B.C. 160 and 60, several Caesars held public offices, at least four being honoured with the consulship.</p>
 <p>Of the youth and education of Iulius Caesar little is known excepting that he was under the instruction of the distinguished teacher of grammar and rhetoric, M. Antonius Gnipho , who for a time taught in his home. Though allied by descent with the aristocracy, he was brought into relation with the popular party through the marriage of his aunt Iulia with the great leader Marius. In B.C. 83, he himself married Cornelia, the daughter of Marius's most ardent supporter, Cinna. This vexed Sulla , who, regaining the ascendency at Rome the following year, ordered Caesar to divorce her. Unlike Pompey and Piso, who put away their wives at Sulla 's bidding, Caesar boldly refused. Sulla confiscated his property, and revoked the priesthood of Iupiter, which had been conferred upon him through the influence of Marius. As his life was now in danger, he went into hiding, hotly pursued from place to place by Sulla 's emissaries. After a time his friends, aided by the Vestal Virgins, succeeded in securing pardon for him from Sulla , who is said to have granted it with the remark that Caesar would some time be the ruin of the aristocracy, for in him there was many a Marius. Soon afterwards, desirous of gaining the military experience considered necessary for a young Roman of rank, he joined the staff of M. Minucius Thermus, who was besieging Mytilené. Here he saved the life of a fellow-soldier, displaying so great bravery that he was honoured with a civic crown. After Mytilené fell he entered the <cb /> service of P. Servilius in Cilicia; but immediately on hearing of the death of Sulla , in 78, he returned to Rome.</p>
 <p>The following year Caesar introduced himself to public notice by bringing a charge of provincial extortion against Gnaeus Dolabella, who had been proconsul of Macedonia. Though unsuccessful, in 76 he was invited to accuse Antonius of similar misconduct in Greece. Antonius also was acquitted, but the young prosecutor gained great popularity and a considerable reputation for oratory by his pleas. He now started for Rhodes, to pursue the study of oratory under Molo. Near Miletus he was captured by pirates, and was detained on the island of Pharmacusa until he could get together a ransom of fifty talents (over $55,000). Having been set at liberty, he procured ships, captured the pirates, took them to Pergamus, and crucified them, thus carrying out a threat which he had jestingly pronounced when with them. He spent a short time at Rhodes, and then passed over to Asia, where he rendered gallant service against an army of Mithridates. In the winter of 74-73, he returned to Rome, having been chosen to fill a vacancy in the college of <hi rend="italic">pontifices.</hi> He now threw himself into political life with an energy that yielded to no opposition and a reckless liberality that hesitated at no expenditure. He was affable to every one, and no applicant for aid went away empty-handed. He soon exhausted his inheritance, and became deeply involved in debt; but his popularity was unbounded. Having taken a stand in opposition to the Sullan constitution and the aristocracy, he received the offices in the gift of the people in regular succession. In 67, he was quaestor, serving under Antistius Vetus in Further Spain. In 65, he was curule aedile, with M. Bibulus as colleague. Extravagant expenditures upon games and buildings raised his popularity to the highest pitch. He increased the power and influence of the popular party in many ways, but by no single act did he kindle the enthusiasm of the populace more than by privately restoring the trophies of Marius, which had been destroyed by Sulla , and replacing them by night on the Capitol. Marius's veterans crowded around them with tears and shouting. The Senate, notwithstanding the formal denunciation of Marius as a public enemy, was obliged to yield to the popular feeling and leave them in the place of honour.</p>
 <p>Caesar was charged with complicity in both the Catilinarian conspiracies, but evidence is wanting. In 62, he was praetor, carrying himself with great firmness and discretion amid scenes of violence. The following year he governed the province of Further Spain with distinction, both as a civil administrator and as a general. He subdued several tribes and captured the city of Brigantium, in the extreme northwestern part. At the expiration of his year of office he came back to Rome with ample means to satisfy his creditors. In 60, he was chosen consul for 59, the aristocracy making every effort to secure the election of Bibulus as his colleague to offset his influence. About this time he brought about a reconciliation between Pompey and Marcus Crassus, entering with them into the coalition known as the First Triumvirate. These ties were strengthened further by the marriage of his daughter Julia to Pompey. During his consulship he was influential in promoting the interests of Pompey and Crassus; at the same time 
<pb n="247" /><cb />
 he kept his standing with the people, and was especially serviceable to the important body of <seg lang="la">equites.</seg> Instead of the usual proconsular command for one year, he easily obtained the governorship of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyricum, and Transalpine Gaul, of which only the southeastern portion had been subdued, for five years, together with the control of four legions. During the next nine years (58-50), Caesar was engaged in the conquest of Transalpine Gaul. Summers were devoted to military operations; but when possible he spent a part of the winter in Cisalpine Gaul, in close communication with his friends at Rome. In 56, he again reconciled Pompey and Crassus, who met with him at Luca; in 55, his command was continued for five years longer. The conquest of Gaul was no easy matter, both from the advancement of its civilization and the character of the country (see <ref type="cross" target="crossgallia">Gallia</ref>); but Caesar accomplished it, in a series of campaigns which, for variety and skill of tactics as well as unremitting energy of movement, are unsurpassed in the annals of warfare. He twice bridged the Rhine and invaded Germany; twice also he crossed over to Britain, reducing the tribes along the southeast coast to nominal subjection. By the year 50, Gaul was completely conquered, and well on the way towards complete organization as a Roman province. <figure id="fig.00247">

 <p>The death of Iulia, Pompey's wife and Caesar's daughter, in 54, and that of Crassus a year later in the East, broke the common bond between the two great military leaders and put an end to the compact of the triumvirate. Pompey, viewing with jealousy and alarm the victorious career of his younger rival, entered into an alliance with the aristocratic party, and endeavoured to check the increasing power of Caesar by means of senatorial enactments. In his interest the Senate, early in B.C. 50, passed a decree that each of the commanders should give up a legion for the Parthian War. As Pompey had lent one of his to Caesar in 53, this was now demanded back. Although the intent of the whole matter was clearly to weaken Caesar, he gave up Pompey's legion and one of his own as directed; but the troops, instead of being despatched to the East, were placed in camp at Capua. It became clearer every day that Caesar's friends were powerless to obtain for him the recognition and privileges to which he was justly entitled; that the senatorial party and Pompey would scruple at nothing to gain the advantage over him. While his commission prevented him from entering Italy, and no dispensation from it was granted, Pompey was permitted to administer an important command in Spain through lieutenants, and at the same time remained at Rome. The climax was reached early in January, B.C. 49, when the Senate, amid great uproar, decreed that Caesar should disband his army by a certain date, under penalty of being considered a public enemy if he failed to do so; and that the magistrates should take measures to provide for the security of the State. The tribunes M. Antonius and Q. Cassius, <cb /> who had in vain interposed their veto, were obliged to flee, and took refuge with Caesar, calling upon him to defend the inviolable sanctity of their office. War was now inevitable.</p>
 <p>With the vigour and despatch characteristic of his previous military operations, Caesar at once crossed the river Rubicon, the southern boundary of his province. Within three months he was master of the whole of Italy, Pompey and the more zealous adherents of the aristocratic party having fled to Greece. He now set out for Spain, and soon dispersed the forces of Pompey there, meanwhile gaining possession of Sicily and Sardinia also, through his lieutenants Curio and Valerius. In Africa and Illyricum his officers were less successful; but on his way back from Spain he forced the surrender of Massilia, which in his absence had withstood a siege at the hands of Trebonius and Decimus Brutus. By this time Pompey had gathered a large army in Greece, and had also a powerful fleet at his service. Nothing daunted, Caesar crossed the Adriatic in January, 48, and with a far inferior force tried to blockade his opponent at Dyrrachium. Being unsuccessful, and also reduced to straits for supplies, he withdrew into Thessaly. Pompey followed, over-confident. The decisive battle was fought on the plain of Pharsalus, in Thessaly, August 9th, B.C. 48. Pompey had 47,000 infantry and 7000 cavalry, Caesar barely 22,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry. But superior generalship and discipline, and the courage of despair, won the day against greater numbers. Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was immediately murdered. When the news of the victory reached Rome, Caesar was appointed dictator for a year, and other offices also were conferred upon him, so that, under the forms of the old constitution, he possessed absolute authority. <figure id="fig.00247.2">

</figure></p>
 <p>Having followed Pompey to Egypt, Caesar was there for a time in great danger on account of the disturbance known as the Alexandrine War, which arose from a dispute regarding the succession. He placed Cleopatra on the throne, and in the spring of 47 proceeded to Pontus, where he defeated Pharnaces, a son of Mithridates, near Zela, announcing the victory at Rome in the famous despatch, <title>Veni, vidi, vici</title>, “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Early in 46, he crossed over to Africa, crushing the remnants of the senatorial forces there at the battle of Thapsus, April 6. Returning to Rome, where his supremacy was no longer disputed, he treated his former opponents with unlooked-for clemency, and inaugurated several salutary reforms, among which not the least important was the rearrangement of the calendar. The sons of Pompey gathered an army in Spain, which he defeated at the battle of Munda, March 17th, B.C. 45. During the ensuing months, Caesar's powers as a civil administrator had full scope. His projects, few of which were destined to be realized, were characterized by statesmanship of a high order, which has come to be the more admired the better it has been understood. 
<pb n="248" /><cb /> But he was not beyond the reach of malice and envy. A conspiracy was formed against him; the leaders of it were Marcus Brutus and Cassius. The conspirators were actuated by different motives—some, no doubt, by personal jealousy and hatred; others by a patriotic desire to restore the old republican constitution; a few, perhaps, by ambitious designs upon the spoils of State. On the 15th of March, B.C. 44, as Caesar was entering the hall connected with Pompey's theatre to attend a meeting of the Senate, he was set upon, and fell pierced by twenty-three wounds.</p>
 <p>Caesar holds a unique place in the history not merely of Rome, but of the world. In his time the government of Rome had been found wholly inadequate to meet the administrative demands of a great empire. More and more the military became <figure id="fig.00248">
<head orig="Iulius Caesar. (Statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome.)">Iulius Caesar. (Statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome.)</head>
</figure> paramount to the civil power in the State, and the old-time balance of political parties gave place to violent strifes between successful generals. The perpetuation of the Roman government demanded centralization of authority. Cherishing the ambition to become the great political leader of his generation, Caesar became supreme, not by usurpation, but by the natural exercise of extraordinary executive abilities under political conditions which admitted of no alternative between anarchy and absolutism. He appears to have had a truer insight into the needs of his country than any of his contemporaries. His genius was not, as often represented, merely destructive, but was constructive as well. After his death, Rome had no peace or prosperity till political authority was again concentrated in the hands of Augustus. But this many-sided <cb /> man was great not merely as a statesman. As a general he is ranked in the same class with Alexander, Hannibal, and Napoleon; as an orator he was reckoned in his day second only to Cicero; and as a writer he has long since received a place among the world's greatest masters. Tall, with fair complexion and expressive black eyes, sensitive in regard to his appearance and neat to the verge of effeminacy, gracious in address and Epicurean in both tastes and beliefs, in external characteristics he might have passed for a man of the world, at home in the gay society of a luxurious capital. But in ambition, in energy, in the ability to form plans and to bring things to pass, he belied all appearances, and has probably made a deeper impression upon humanity than any other man that has ever lived.</p>
 <p>With the exception of a few fragments, Caesar's speeches have perished. A like fate has befallen his poems, most of which were composed in early life, and his treatise on grammar, in two books. Among other writings that were published was a tract written in opposition to Cicero's panegyric on Cato , in two books (see <ref type="cross" target="crossanticatones">Anticatones</ref>); a treatise on astronomy, and a collection of witticisms. Only his invaluable “Memoirs” are extant—“On the Gallic War” (<title>De Bello Gallico</title>), in seven books, and “On the Civil War” (<title>De Bello Civili</title>), in three books, the former published probably in B.C. 51. These works are written in a simple, concise, straightforward style, remarkably free from military technicalities of the sort to trouble the reader. They were no doubt designed to justify the author in the eyes of his countrymen, but their credibility on the whole is not thereby seriously impaired. An eighth book was added to the <title>Gallic War</title> by Aulus Hirtius; and unknown authors extended the <title>Civil War</title> by narratives concerning the Alexandrine, African, and Spanish wars.</p>

The first inhabitants were Syrians and Greeks (Joseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xx. 6). It was subsequently made a magnificent city and port by Herod, who called it Caesarea, in 
<pb n="250" /><cb />
 honour of Augustus; and it now began to receive Jews among its inhabitants. Frequent contentious hence arose, in consequence of the diversity of faiths that prevailed within its walls. Here the Roman governor resided, and a Roman garrison was continually kept. Vespasian, after the Jewish War, settled a Roman colony in it, with the additional title of Colonia Prima Flavia. In later times it became the capital of Palaestina Prima. This city is frequently mentioned in the New Testament. Here King Agrippa was smitten, for neglecting to give God the praise when the people loaded him with flattery. Here Cornelius the centurion was baptized; and also Philip, the deacon, with his four daughters; and here Agabus the prophet foretold to Paul that he would be bound at Jerusalem (Acts, viii. 10). The modern name of the place is Kaisarieh. It was the birthplace of Eusebius.</p>
 <p>(2) The capital of Mauritania Caesariensis, and a place of some note in the time of the Roman emperors. It was originally called Iol, but was beautified at a subsequent period by Iuba, who made it his residence, and changed its name to Caesarea, in honour of Augustus.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Caesarea ad Argaeum</hi>, the capital of Cappadocia, called by this name in the reign of Tiberius, previously Mazaca. It was situate at the foot of Mount Argaeus, as its name indicates, and was a place of great antiquity, its foundation having even been ascribed by some writers to Mesech, the son of Japhet (Ioseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> i. 6). The modern name is Kaisarieh.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Caesarēa Philippi</hi>, a town on the northern confines of Palestine, in the district of Trachonitis, at the foot of Mount Paneus, and near the springs of the Jordan. It was also called Leshem, Laish, Dan, and Paneas. The name Paneas is supposed to have been given it by the Phoenicians. The appellation of Dan was given to it by the tribe of that name, because the portion assigued to them was “too little for them,” and they therefore “went up to fight against Leshem (or Laish, Judg. xviii. 29), and took it,” calling it “Dan, after the name of Dan, their father” (Josh. xix. 47). Eusebius and Jerome distinguish Dan from Paneas as if they were different places, though near each other; but most writers consider them as one place, and even Jerome himself, on Ezek. xlviii., says that Dan or Leshem was afterwards called Paneas. Philip, the tetrarch, rebuilt it, or at least embellished and enlarged it, and named it Caesarea, in honour of the emperor Tiberius; and afterwards Agrippa, in compliment to Nero, called it Neronias.</p>

 <p> (from <seg lang="la">caedo</seg>, and not to be confounded with <seg lang="la">cestus</seg>, from Greek <foreign lang="greek">κεστός</foreign>). The thongs or bands of leather which were tied round the hands of boxers, in order to render their blows more powerful.

<head orig="Statue of a Boxer with the Caestus. (From the Louvre.)">Statue of a Boxer with the Caestus. (From the Louvre.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The caestus was used by boxers from the earliest times. The ordinary boxing-gloves were called in Greek <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάντες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάντες πυκτικοί</foreign>. When Epeius and Euryalus in the <title>Iliad</title> (xxiii. 684) prepare themselves for boxing, they put on their hands thongs made of ox-hide. (Cf. Theocr. xxii. 81; <bibl n="A. R. 2.53" default="NO" valid="yes">Apoll. Rhod. ii. 53</bibl>.) But it should be recollected that the caestus in heroic times appears to have consisted merely of thongs of leather, and differed materially from the frightful weapons loaded with lead and iron which were used in later times. The different kinds of caestus were called by the Greeks in later times <foreign lang="greek">μειλίχαι, σπεῖραι βόειαι, σφαῖραι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">μύρμηκες</foreign>—of which the <foreign lang="greek">μειλίχαι</foreign> gave the softest blows, and the <foreign lang="greek">μύρμηκες</foreign> the most severe. The <foreign lang="greek">μειλίχαι</foreign>, which were the most ancient, are described by Pausanias (viii. 40. 3) as made of raw ox-hide cut into thin pieces, and joined in an ancient manner; they were tied under the hollow or palm of the hand, leaving the fingers uncovered. The athletae in the palaestrae at Olympia used the <foreign lang="greek">μειλίχαι</foreign> only in practising for the public games.</p>
 <p>The caestus used in later times in the public games was, as has been already remarked, a most formidable weapon. It was frequently covered with knots and nails, and loaded with lead and iron; whence Vergil, in speaking of it, says, 
<pb n="251" /><cb />

 <p>Statius also speaks of <seg lang="la">nigrantia plumbo tegmina.</seg> Such weapons, in the hands of a trained boxer, must have frequently occasioned death. The <foreign lang="greek">μύρμηκες</foreign> were, in fact, sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">γυιοτόροι</foreign>, or “limb-breakers.” Lucilius speaks of a boxer whose head had been so battered by the <foreign lang="greek">μύρμηκες</foreign> as to resemble a sieve.

He worked in marble and metal, as well as gold and ivory, and was master of sculpture in all its branches, from the chiselling of small silver vessels to the execution of colossal statues in bronze. His Apollo, at Apollonia in Pontus, was 120 feet high. This statue was carried away to Rome by Lucullus and set up on the Capitol. We hear of statues of the gods and heroic women from his hand, as well as of men on horseback and four-horsed chariots. His horses are said to have been unsurpassed. His female figures, if we may believe the ancient critics, were characterized by antique harshness and severity, but relieved by a touch of grace and delicacy.

He followed Alexander from India, and, becoming ill when they had reached Persia, he desired to have his funeral pile erected. Having offered up his prayers, poured libations upon himself, and cut off part of his hair 
<pb n="252" /><cb />
 and thrown it into the fire, he ascended the pile, and did not move at the approach of the flames. Plutarch says that, in taking leave of the Macedonians, he desired them to spend the day in merriment and drinking with their king, “for I shall see him,” said he, “in a little while at Babylon.” Alexander died in Babylon three months after this.

<head orig="Calchas">Calchas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κάλχας</foreign>). A celebrated soothsayer, son of Thestor. He had received from Apollo the knowledge of future events; and the Greeks, accordingly, on their departure for the Trojan War, nominated him their high-priest and prophet. Among the interpretations of events imputed to him, it is said that he predicted that Troy could not be taken without the aid of Achilles; and that, having observed a serpent, during a solemn sacrifice, glide from under an altar, ascend a tree, and devour nine young birds with their mother, and afterwards become itself changed into stone, he inferred that the siege of Troy would last ten years. He also foretold that the Grecian fleet, which was at that same time detained by contrary winds in the harbour of Aulis, would not be able to sail until Agamemnon should have sacrificed his own daughter Iphigenia. Calchas likewise advised Agamemnon, during the pestilence by which Apollo desolated the Grecian camp, to restore Chryseïs to her father, as the only means of 
<pb n="253" /><cb />
 appeasing the god. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.) He was consulted, indeed, on every affair of importance, and appears to have often determined, with Agamemnon and Odysseus, the import of the oracles which he expounded. His death is said to have happened as follows. After the taking of Troy, he accompanied Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraüs, to Colophon in Ionia. It had been predicted that he should not die until he found a prophet more skilful than himself: this he experienced in the person of Mopsus. He was unable to tell how many figs were on the branches of a certain fig-tree; and when Mopsus mentioned the exact number Calchas retired to the wood of Claros, sacred to Apollo, where he expired of grief and mortification. Calchas had the patronymic, Thestorides.

It was probably nothing more than hot water, flavoured with spices and herbs; and though wine was often drunk with it, there is no good reason for considering <seg lang="la">calda</seg> a sort of punch or negus in which wine was already <figure id="fig.00253.2">
<head orig="Bronze Vessels for serving the Calda. (Pompeii.)">Bronze Vessels for serving the Calda. (Pompeii.)</head>

 <p>(2) The boiler (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκεῖον</foreign>) used in heating the water for the baths.</p>
 <p>(3) A portable cooking-stove. In this sense the word <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg> occurs only in late authors, though the thing itself is well known through numerous specimens found at Pompeii, and now in the Naples Museum. The classical term for it is probably <seg lang="la">focus.</seg> In Seneca's time, Roman epicurism brought these stoves into the dining-room (<seg lang="la">cenatio</seg>), that the dishes might be served to perfection.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg> here figured has been described <figure id="fig.00253.3"><head>Caldarium. (<title>Museo Borbonico</title>, xii. pl. 46.)</head></figure> by Rich. The sides, which are hollow, contained water; and a small cock projects from one of them (seen in the engraving), by which it was drawn off. The four towers at the angles are provided with movable lids; the centre received the lighted charcoal, and cooking vessels might be placed on it or suspended over it. Another contrivance (see <ref type="cross" target="crossauthepsa">Authepsa</ref>) seems to combine the two purposes of supplying hot water and keeping dishes hot. It has the cylinder with a place in the centre for a charcoal fire, which is the characteristic of an <seg lang="la">authepsa;</seg> and it is also furnished with a shallow, oblong tray, into which the hot water from the cylinder was drawn by a cock, and on which dishes may have been placed.</p>
 <p>These <seg lang="la">caldaria</seg> might be shaped like a mile-stone (as in a specimen figured <title>Mus. Borbon.</title> iv. pl. 59, also by Saglio) or in more eccentric designs (<seg lang="la">dracones et miliaria et complures formas</seg>, <title>Nat. Quaest.</title> iii. 24. 2).

This made up a lunar year of 354 days, 11 days short of the solar year. To maintain some correspondence between the lunar and the solar years, and to provide at least for the festivals of the seasons always occurring at the right time of year, the Athenians early resorted to the method of intercalation. A space of time was taken which included as many days as would exactly make up eight solar years, and could easily be distributed among the same number of lunar years. This space of time was called a “great year.” Then in every third, sixth, and eighth year, a month of 29 or 30 days was inserted, so that the years in question consisted each of 383 or 384 days. This system was introduced at Athens by Solon. The period of eight years was sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">ἐνναετηρίς</foreign>, or a period of nine years, because it began again with every ninth year; sometimes <foreign lang="greek">ὀκταετηρίς</foreign>, or space of eight years. For this the astronomers, of whom <ref type="cross" target="crossmeton">Meton</ref> (q.v.) in the Periclean Age may be taken as a representative, substituted a more accurate system, which was afterwards adopted in Athens and other cities as a correction of the old calendar. This was the <foreign lang="greek">ἐννεακαιδεκαετηρίς</foreign> of nineteen years. The alternate “full” and “hollow” months were divided into three decades, consisting of 10 or 9 days each, as the case might be. The days of the last decade were counted from more to less to correspond with the waning of the moon. Thus the 21st of the month was called the 10th of the waning moon, the 22d the 9th, the 23d the 8th, and so on. The reckoning of the year, with the order and names of the months, differed more or less in different States, the only common point being the names of the months, which were almost without exception taken from the chief festivals celebrated in them. The Athenians and the other Ionian peoples began their year with the first new moon after the summer solstice, the Dorians with the autumnal equinox, the Boeotians and other Aeolians <cb /> with the winter solstice. The table given below shows the succession of the Attic months, the number of days they contained, and the corresponding months of our year.</p>
 <p>At the time when the Calendar Julian was adopted by the Athenians, probably about the time of the emperor Hadrian, the lunar year appears to have been changed into the solar year; and it has further been conjectured that the beginning of the year was transferred from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox. The intercalary month was a second Poseideon inserted in the middle of the year. The official system of numbering the years differed also very much in the various States. The years received their names from the magistrates, sometimes secular, sometimes spiritual. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosseponymus">Eponymus</ref>.) Historical chronology was first computed according to Olympiads, or periods of four years, beginning B.C. 776, by the historian Timaeus in the third century B.C.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The Roman year was supposed to have consisted, under Romulus, of 10 months— four “full” ones of 31 days (March, May, July, and October) and six “hollow” of 30 days (April, June, August, September, November, December). But, as a space of 304 days makes up neither a solar nor a lunar year, it is difficult to understand the so-called “year of Romulus.” King Numa was popularly supposed to have introduced the year of 12 months by adding January and February at the end; for the Roman year, it must be remembered, began originally with March. By this system every month except February had an odd number of days: March 31, April 29, May 31, June 29, Quintilis 31, Sextilis 29, September 29, October 31, November 29, December 29, January 29, February 28. Numa is also credited with the attempt to square this lunar year of 355 days with the solar year of 365; but how he did it is not certainly known. The Decemviri in B.C. 450 probably introduced the system of adjustment afterwards in use. According to this, a cycle of four years was taken, in the second year of <figure id="fig.00254">
<head orig="Roman Calendar, with Copy of Inscription for January. (Pompeii.)">Roman Calendar, with Copy of Inscription for January. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> which an intercalary month (<seg lang="la">mensis mercedonius</seg>) of 23 days was inserted between the 24th and 25th of February, and in the fourth year a month of 22 days between the 23d and 24th of February. 
<pb n="255" /><cb />
 Thus the period of four years amounted to 1465 days. But this gave the year an average of 366 1/4 days, or one day too many, so that a special rectification was necessary from time to time. This was probably carried out by the omission of an intercalary month. It was the business of the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi> to keep the calendar in order by regular intercalation; but, partly from carelessness, partly from political motives, they made insertions and omissions so incorrectly as to bring the calendar into complete confusion, and destroy the correspondence between the months and the seasons. The mischief was finally remedied by Iulius Caesar, with the assistance of the mathematician Sosigenes. To bring the calendar into correspondence with the seasons, the year B.C. 46 was lengthened so as to consist of 15 months, or 415 days, and the calendar known as the Julian was introduced on the 1st of January, B.C. 45. This calendar is founded simply on the solar year, which is well known to be a discovery of the Egyptians. Caesar fixed this year at 365 1/4 days, which is correct within a few minutes. After this, the ordinary year consisted of 365 days, divided into 12 months, with the names still in use. Every fourth year had 366 days, a day being inserted at the end of February. The Julian Calendar maintained its ground till 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII. corrected the trifling error which still attached to it. The old names of the months were retained with two exceptions—that of Quintilis, which, in honour of Iulius Caesar, was called Iulius, and that of Sextilis, which in B.C. 8 was called Augustus, in honour of the emperor. The old divisions of the lunar month were also retained for convenience of dating. These were (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the Kalendae, marking the first appearance of the new moon; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the Nonae, marking the first quarter; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the Idus, marking the full moon. Kalendae means properly the day of summoning, from <seg lang="la">calare</seg>, to summon. The pontifex was bound to observe the first phase, and to make his announcement to the Rex Sacrorum, who then summoned the people to the Capitol, in front of the Curia Calabra, so called from <seg lang="la">calare.</seg> Here he offered sacrifice, and announced that the first quarter would begin on the fifth or seventh day (inclusive) as the case might be. This day was called Nonae, as (according to Roman calculation) the ninth day before the full moon, and fell in March, May, July, and October on the 7th, in the other months on the 5th. The appearance of the full moon was called Idus (probably connected with the Etruscan word <seg lang="la">iduare</seg>, “to divide”), because it divided the month in the middle. The days of the month were counted backwards, in the first half of the month from the Nones and Ides, in the last half from the Kalends of the following month. The Romans also had a week called <hi rend="italic">internundinum</hi>, or the interval between two <seg lang="la">nundinae.</seg> It consisted of eight days, and, like our weeks, could be divided between two months or two years. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfasti">Fasti</ref>.</p>
 <p>After the establishment of the Republic the Romans named their years after the consuls, a custom which was maintained down to the reign of Justinian (A.D. 541). After the time of Augustus it became the practice in literature to date events from the foundation of Rome, which took place, according to Varro, in B.C. 753; according to Cato , in 751.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Day</hi>.—The Greeks reckoned the civil day <cb /> from sunset to sunset, the Romans (like ourselves) from midnight to midnight. The natural day was reckoned by both as lasting from sunrise to sunset. The divisions of the day were for a long time made on no common principle. It was for military purposes that the Romans first devised such a principle, dividing the night during service into four equal watches (<seg lang="la">vigiliae</seg>). Corresponding to this we find another division (probably calculated immediately for the courts of justice) into <seg lang="la">mane</seg> (sunrise to 9 or 10), forenoon (<seg lang="la">ad meridiem</seg>), afternoon (<seg lang="la">de meridie</seg>) until 3 or 4, and evening (<seg lang="la">suprema</seg>) from thence till sunset. After the introduction of sundials and waterclocks, the day and night were divided each into twelve hours; but the division was founded on the varying length of the day, so that each hour of the day was longer, and conversely each hour of the night shorter, in summer than in winter.</p>
 <p>It should be observed that several of the Eastern nations, for the purpose of preventing confusion in their calculations with other nations, dropped the names of their months, and merely counted the months, as the first, second, third, etc., month.

<head orig="Caliga. (Arch of Trajan.)">Caliga. (Arch of Trajan.)</head>
</figure> (q. v.) received that cognomen when a boy, in consequence of wearing the <seg lang="la">caliga</seg>, which his father, Germanicus, put upon his son in order to please the soldiers ( <bibl n="Tac.

<div2 id="crosscaligula" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Caligŭla</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanĭcus</foreName>
 <p>, son of Germanicus and Agrippina, was born A.D. 12, in the camp, probably in Germany, and was brought up among the legions ( <title>Calig.</title> 8). Here he received from the soldiers the surname of Caligula, from his being arrayed, when quite young, like a common soldier, and wearing a pair of <seg lang="la">caligae</seg>, a kind of shoe or covering for the feet used chiefly by the common soldiers. This was done in order to secure towards him the goodwill of the troops. Caligula himself, however, disliked the appellation in after-days, and preferred that of Gaius Caesar, which is also his historical name. Upon his father's death he returned from Syria, and lived with his mother till her exile, when he removed to the residence of Livia Augusta, his great-grandmother, whose funeral oration he delivered in public, while he still wore the <seg lang="la">praetexta.</seg> He afterwards remained in the family of his grandmother, Antonia, until his twentieth year, when, being invited to Capreae by the emperor, he assumed the dress proper to manhood, but without the customary ceremonies.</p>
 <p>In the court of his grandfather, his naturally mean and vicious temper appeared in a servile compliance with the caprices of those in power, in a wanton love of cruelty towards the unfortunate, and in the most abandoned and unprincipled debauchery; so that Tiberius observed that he was <cb /> <figure id="fig.00256.2">
<head orig="Caligula. (Bronze bust in Paris.)">Caligula. (Bronze bust in Paris.)</head>
</figure> breeding a second Phaëthon for the destruction of the world. Tiberius had, by his testament, appointed his two grandsons, Gaius Caesar and Tiberius Gemellus, the latter the son of Drusus, joint heirs of the Empire. The first act of Caligula, however, was to assemble the Senate for the purpose of declaring the invalidity of the will; and this being readily effected, and Tiberius Gemellus being declared too young to rule, Gaius Caesar Caligula was immediately proclaimed emperor. This appointment was received with the most unbounded joy both at Rome and in the provinces, and the conduct of the new prince seemed at first to promise one of the most auspicious of reigns. But this was all dissimulation on his part—a dissimulation which he had learned under his wily predecessor—for Caligula esteemed it prudent to assume the appearance of moderation, liberality, and justice, till he should be firmly seated on the throne, and freed from all apprehension lest the claims of the young Tiberius might be revived on any offence having been taken by the Senate. He interred, in the most honourable manner, the remains of his mother and of his brother Nero, set free all state prisoners, recalled the banished, and forbade all prosecutions for treason. He conferred on the magistrates free and independent power. Although the will of Tiberius had been declared, by the Senate, to be null and void, he fulfilled every article of it, with the exception only of that above mentioned. When he was chosen consul, he took his uncle Claudius as his colleague. Thus he distinguished the first eight months of his reign by many actions dictated perhaps by hypocrisy, but which 
<pb n="257" /><cb />
 appeared magnanimous and noble to the eyes of the world, when he fell, on a sudden, dangerously ill, in consequence, as has been imagined, of a love-potion given him by his mistress, Milonia Caesonia (whom he afterwards married), with a view to securing his inconstant affections. On recovering from this malady, whether weary by this time of the restraints of hypocrisy, or actually deranged in his intellect by the inflammatory effects of the potion which he had taken ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 614" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 614</bibl>), the emperor threw off all appearance of virtue and moderation, as well as all prudential considerations, and acted on every occasion with the mischievous violence of unbridled passions and wanton power; so that the tyranny of Tiberius was forgotten in the enormities of Caligula. The most exquisite tortures served him for enjoyments. During his meals he caused criminals, and even innocent persons, to be stretched on the rack and beheaded; the most respectable citizens were daily executed. In the madness of his arrogance he even considered himself a god, and caused the honours to be paid to him which were paid to Apollo, to Mars, and even to Iupiter. He built a temple to his own divinity. At one time he wished that the whole Roman people had but one head, that he might be able to cut it off at a single blow. He frequently repeated the words of Attius, <title>Oderint dum metuant.</title> One of his greatest follies was the building of a bridge of vessels between Baiae and Puteoli, in imitation of that of Xerxes over the Hellespont. He himself consecrated this grand structure with great splendour; and, after he had passed the night following in a revel with his friends, in order to do something extraordinary before his departure he caused a crowd of persons, without distinction of age, rank, or character, to be seized and thrown into the sea. On his return he entered Rome in triumph, because, as he said, he had conquered nature herself. After this he made preparations for an expedition against the Germans; passed, with more than 200,000 men, over the Rhine; but returned after he had travelled a few miles, and that without having seen an enemy. Such was his terror that when he came to the river, and found the bridge obstructed by the crowd upon it, he caused himself to be passed over the heads of the soldiers. He then went to Gaul, which he plundered with unexampled rapacity. Not content with the considerable booty thus obtained, he sold all the property of his sisters Agrippina and Livilla, whom he banished. He also sold the furniture of the old court, the clothes of Augustus, Agrippina, etc. Before he left Gaul he declared his intention of going to <figure id="fig.00257">
<head orig="Coin of Caligula, with his head and that of Augustus (the latter crowned).">Coin of Caligula, with his head and that of Augustus (the latter crowned).</head>
</figure> Britain. He collected his army on the coast, embarked in a magnificent galley, but returned when he had hardly left the land, drew up his forces, ordered the signal of battle to be sounded, and commanded the soldiers to fill their helmets with shells, while he cried out, “This booty, ravished from the sea, is fit for my palace and the Capitol.” When he returned to Rome he was desirous of a triumph on account of his achievements, <cb /> but contented himself with an ovation. Discontented with the Senate, he resolved to destroy the greater part of the members and the most distinguished men of Rome, as was proved by two books which were found after his death, wherein the names of the proscribed were noted down, and of which one was entitled <title>Gladius</title> (Sword), and the other <title>Pugillus</title> (Dagger). He became reconciled to the Senate, however, when he found it worthy of him. He supported public brothels and gaming-houses in the palace, and received himself the entrance-money of the visitors. His horse, named Incitatus, was his favourite. This horse he made one of his priests, and, by way of insult to the Republic, declared it also consul. It was kept in an ivory stable and fed from a golden manger, and when it was invited to feast at the emperor's table gilded oats were served up in a golden basin of exquisite workmanship. He had even the intention of destroying the poems of Homer, and was on the point of removing the works and images of Vergil and Livy from all libraries—those of the former because, as he said, he was destitute of genius and learning; those of the latter because he was not to be depended upon as an historian. Caligula's morals were, from his youth upward, abominably corrupt, but after he had married and repudiated several wives, Caesonia retained a permanent hold on his affections. His extravagance equalled his cruelty, for in a single year he squandered the entire savings of Tiberius, some $28,000,000, a favourite amusement of his being to stand on a balcony and shovel goldpieces into the street. At length, a number of conspirators, at the head of whom were Chaerea and Cornelius Sabinus, both tribunes of the praetorian cohorts, murdered him in the twenty-ninth year of his age, and the fourth of his reign, A.D. 41. His life was written by Suetonius. See Baring-Gould's <bibl default="NO"><title>Tragedy of the Caesars</title> (London, 1893)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosscallimachus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Callimăchus">Callimachus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καλλίμαχος</foreign>). (1) A Greek artist, who flourished in the second half of the fifth century B.C. He was the inventor of the Corinthian order of pillar; and the art of boring marble is also attributed to him, though perhaps he did no more than bring it to perfection. The ancient critics represent him as unwearied in polishing and perfecting his work; indeed, they allege that his productions lost something through their excessive refinement and purity. One of his celebrated works was the golden chandelier in the Erechtheum at Athens.
 </p>
 <p>(2) A Greek scholar and poet, the chief representative of the Alexandrian School. He was the son of Battus, and thus sprung from the noble family of the Battiadae. He at first gave his lectures in a suburb of Alexandria; but was afterwards summoned by Ptolemy Philadelphus to the Museum there, and in about B.C. 260 was made curator of the library. He held this office till his death, which took place about B.C. 240. He did a great service to literature by sifting and cataloguing the numerous books collected at Alexandria. The results of his labours were published in his great work, called <foreign lang="greek">Πίνακες</foreign>, or “Tablets.” This contained 120 books, and was a catalogue, arranged in chronological order, of the works contained in the library, with observations on their genuineness, an indication of the first and last word in each book, and a note of its bulk. This work laid the foundation of a critical study of Greek literature. Eight hundred works, partly in prose and partly in verse, were attributed altogether to Callimachus; but it is to be observed that he avoided, on principle, the composition of long poems, so as to be able to give more thought to the artistic elaboration of details. The essence of Callimachus's verse is art and learning, not poetic genius in the real sense. Indeed, some of his compositions had a directly learned object—the <foreign lang="greek">Αἴτια</foreign>, or “Causes,” for instance. This was a collection of elegiac poems in four books, treating, with great erudition, of the foundation of cities, the origin of religious ceremonies, and the like.</p>
 <p>Through his writings, as well as through his oral instruction, Callimachus exercised an immense influence, not only on the course of learning, but on the poetical tendencies of the <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref> (q.v.). Among his pupils were the most celebrated savants of the time, Eratosthenes, Aristophanes 
<pb n="259" /><cb /> of Byzantium, Apollonius of Rhodes, and others. Of his writings only a very few have survived in a complete state. These are: six hymns, five of which are in epic and one in elegiac form, and sixty-four epigrams. The hymns, both in their language and their matter, attest the learned taste of their author. His elegy, entitled the <title>Coma Berenices</title>, or “Lock of Berenice,” is imitated by Catullus in one of his remaining pieces. Ovid, in the twentieth of his <title>Heroides</title>, as well as in his <title>Ibis</title>, took poems of Callimachus for his models. Indeed, the Romans generally set a very high value on his elegies, and liked to imitate them. Of his other works in prose and poetry—among the latter may be mentioned a very popular epic called <title>Hecaté</title>—only fragments have survived. A good edition of the remains is that of Schneider, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1870-73)</bibl>; and of the Hymns and Epigrams those of Meineke <bibl default="NO">(1861)</bibl> and Wilamowitz <bibl default="NO">(1882)</bibl>.

The punishment to which she was liable was to be cast down from a precipitous and rocky height, but she was pardoned in consequence of the peculiar circumstances of her case. A law, however, was immediately passed, ordaining that the teachers of gymnastic exercises should appear naked at the games (Pausan. v. 6, 5).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καλλισθένης</foreign>). A Greek historian, born at Olynthus about B.C. 360. He was a relation of Aristotle, from whom he received instruction at the same time as Alexander the Great. He accompanied Alexander on his Asiatic campaign, and offended him by refusing to pay him servile homage after the Persian fashion, and by other daring exhibitions of independence. The consequence was that the king threw his friend into prison on the pretext that he was concerned in a conspiracy against his life. Callisthenes died in captivity in B.C. 328, in consequence, probably, of maltreatment. Of his historical writings, particularly those dealing with the exploits of Alexander, only fragments remain; but he was always ranked among the most famous historians. Indeed, his reputation as the companion of Alexander and the historian of his achievements maintained itself so well that he was made responsible in literature for the romantic narrative of Alexander's life which grew up in the following centuries. This was translated into Latin towards the end of the third century <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.d</hi> by Iulius <ref type="cross" target="crossvalerius">Valerius</ref> (q.v.), and became the main authority for the mediaeval adaptations of the myth of Alexander.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καλλιστώ</foreign>) (called also <ref type="cross" target="crosshelice">Helĭcé</ref>). The daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, and an attendant of Artemis. Zeus saw her, and, assuming the form of Artemis, accompanied the maiden to the chase and overcame her virtue. She long concealed her shame; but at length, as she was one day bathing with her divine mistress, the discovery was made, and Artemis, in her anger, turned her into a bear. While in this form she brought forth her son Arcas, who lived with her in the woods, until the herdsmen caught both her and him and brought them to Lycaon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossarcas">Arcas</ref>.) Some time afterwards she went into the temenus, or sacred enclosure of the Lycaean Zeus, which it was unlawful to enter. A number of Arcadians, among whom was her own son, followed to kill her, but Zeus snatched her out of their hands, and placed her as a constellation in the sky ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii. 8</bibl>; Hygin. <bibl n="Hyg.

This legend is related with great variety in the circumstances. According to one of these versions, Arcas,

 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus Calpurnius</hi> (called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sicŭlus</hi>), a Latin poet, a native of Sicily, lived during the first century of our era, under the emperor Nero. In the earliest editions of his works, and in all but one of the MSS., eleven eclogues pass under his name. Ugoletus, however, at a later period, guided by this single MS., showed that four of the eleven were the work of Nemesianus. The <title>Eclogues</title> of Calpurnius are not without merit, though greatly inferior in elegance and simplicity to Vergil's.

Some time after the Peloponnesian War, we find Calydon in the possession of the Achaeans. It is probable that the Calydonians themselves invited over the Achaeans, to defend them against the Acarnanians (Pausan. iii. 10). Their city was, in consequence, occupied by an Achaean garrison, until Epaminondas, after the battle of Leuctra, compelled them to evacuate the place. It was still a town of importance during the Social War, and as late as the time of Caesar. Augustus accomplished its downfall by removing the inhabitants to Nicopolis.

She gave the hero tools to build a raft or light vessel, supplied him with provisions, and reluctantly took a final leave of him. As regards her island, Homer seems to have conceived Ogygia to lie in the northwestern parts of the Western Sea, far remote from all other isles and coasts; and he thus brought his hero into all parts of that sea, and informed his auditors of all its wonders. Odysseus had two sons by Calypso, named Nausithoüs and Nausinoüs.

 <p>Near the walls on the north was the Palus Camarina, which was a marshy pool formed by the stagnation of the Hipparis near its mouth. Its miasmatic vapours made the city unhealthy, for which reason the inhabitants were anxious to drain it, but were counselled by the Delphic Oracle not to do it (<foreign lang="greek">Μὴ κίνει Καμάριναν· ἀκίνητος γὰρ ἀμείνων</foreign>). In spite of this advice, the marsh was drained, and in consequence the city was laid open to attack on that side, and was captured. The story is doubtless apocryphal, but the words of the oracle passed into a proverb among the Greeks. See Verg. <bibl n="Verg.

<div2 id="crosscambyses" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cambȳses">Cambyses</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καμβύσης</foreign>). (1) An early monarch of the line of the Achaemenides, the successor of Teïspes, who was himself the successor of Achaemenes. He must not be confounded with Cambyses the son of Cyrus, who was, in fact, the second of the name in the line of Persian kings ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 11</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) A Persian of good family, to whom Astyages, king of Media, gave his daughter Mandané in marriage. The issue of this union was Cyrus the Great ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 46</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  107" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 107</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) The son and successor of Cyrus the Great, ascended the throne of Persia B.C. 530. Soon after the commencement of his reign, he undertook the conquest of Egypt, being incited to the step, according to the Persian account as given in Herodotus (iii. 1), by the conduct of Amasis, the king of that country. Cambyses, it seems, had demanded in marriage the daughter of Amasis; but the latter, knowing that the Persian monarch intended to make her, not his wife, but his concubine, endeavoured to deceive him by sending in her stead the daughter of his predecessor Apries. The historian gives another account; but it is more than probable that both are untrue, and that ambitious feelings alone on the part of Cambyses prompted him to the enterprise. Amasis died before Cambyses marched against Egypt, and his son Psammenitus succeeded to the throne. A bloody battle was fought near the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and the Egyptians were put to flight, after which Cambyses made himself master of the whole country, and received tokens of submission also from the Cyrenaeans and the people of Barca. The kingdom of Egypt was thus conquered by him in six months. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Cambyses now formed new projects. He wished to send a squadron and subjugate Carthage, to conquer Aethiopia, and to make himself master of the famous temple of Zeus Ammon. The first of these expeditions, however, did not take 
<pb n="262" /><cb />
 place, because the Phoenicians, who composed his naval force, would not attack one of their own colonies. The army that was sent against the Ammonians perished in the desert, and the troops at whose head he himself had set out against the Aethiopians were compelled by hunger to retreat. How far he advanced into Aethiopia can not be ascertained from anything that Herodotus says. Diodorus Siculus, however (i. 33), makes Cambyses to have penetrated as far as the spot where Meroë stood, which city, according to this same writer, he founded. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmeroe">Meroë</ref>.) After his return from Aethiopia, the Persian king gave himself up to the greatest acts of outrage and cruelty. On entering Memphis he found the inhabitants engaged in celebrating the festival of the reappearance of Apis, and, imagining that these rejoicings were made on account of his ill success, he caused the sacred bull to be brought before him, stabbed him with his dagger, of which wound the animal afterwards died. He also ordered the priests to be scourged.</p>
 <p>Cambyses is said to have been subject to epilepsy from his earliest years; and the habit of drinking, in which he now indulged to excess, rendered him at times completely furious. No relation was held sacred by him when intoxicated. Having dreamed that his brother Smerdis was seated on the royal throne, he sent one of his principal confidants to Persia, with orders to put him to death, a mandate which was actually accomplished. His sister and wife Atossa, who lamented the death of Smerdis, he kicked so severely as to bring on an abortion. These and many other actions, alike indicative of almost complete insanity, aroused against him the feelings of his subjects. A member of the order called the Magi availed himself of this discontent, and, aided by the strong resemblance which he bore to the murdered Smerdis, as well as by the exertions of a brother who was also a Magian, seized upon the throne of Persia, and sent heralds in every direction, commanding all to obey, for the time to come, Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and not Cambyses. The news of this usurpation reached Cambyses at a place in Syria called Ecbatana, where he was at that time with his army. Resolving to return with all speed to Susa, the monarch was in the act of mounting his horse, when his sword fell from its sheath and inflicted a mortal wound in his thigh. An oracle, it is said, had been given him from Butus that he would end his life at Ecbatana, but he had always thought that the Median Ecbatana was meant by it. He died of his wound soon after, B.C. 522, leaving no children. Ctesias gives a different account. He makes Cambyses to have died at Babylon of a wound he had given himself on the femoral muscle, while shaving smooth a piece of wood with a small knife. According to Herodotus (iii. 66), Cambyses reigned seven years and five months. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspersia">Persia</ref>.

 <p>( <ref type="cross" target="crosskammermeister">Kammermeister</ref>), born at Bamberg, April 12th, 1500, was next to Melanchthon among the scholars who contributed to reviving the study of classical antiquities in Germany. His family, originally <hi rend="SmallCaps">Liebhard</hi>, established itself towards the middle of the fifteenth century in Franconia, and assumed the name of Camerarius from the hereditary office of chamberlain to the Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. Joachim was first led to the study of the classics by George Helt, at the University of Leipzig. In 1518, he went to Erfurt and began to teach Greek, and in 1521 joined Melanchthon at Wittenberg. He published a translation of the First Olynthiac of Demosthenes in 1524, and, after worsting Erasmus at Bâle, was appointed in 1526 Professor of Greek at Nuremberg, and was sent in 1530 as delegate to Augsburg, where he took a large part in the preparation of the Confession. In 1535 he was called to Tübingen, where he founded the classical course, and after six years undertook with great success the reorganization of the University of Leipzig, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died in 1574. Camerarius was renowned not only as a great teacher, but especially as an industrious editor. He was among the first to revise texts with scientific care, and left nearly 150 works on varied subjects.

Here he bred up the infant Camilla, the sole companion of his flight; and, having dedicated her to the service of Diana, he instructed her in the use of the bow and arrow, and accustomed her to the practice of martial and sylvan exercises. She was so 
<pb n="263" /><cb />
 remarkable for her swiftness that she is described by the poets as flying over the corn without bending the stalks, and skimming over the surface of the water without wetting her feet. Attended by a train of warriors, she led the Volscians to battle against Aeneas. Many brave chiefs fell by her hand; but she was at length herself killed by a soldier of the name of Aruns, who, from a place of concealment, aimed a javelin at her. Diana, however, who had foreseen this fatal event, had commissioned Opis, one of her nymphs, to avenge the death of Camilla, and Aruns was slain in his flight from the combat by the arrows of the goddess ( <bibl n="Verg.

 <p>A celebrated Roman, called the second Romulus, from his services to his country. After filling various important stations, and, among other achievements, taking the city of Veii, which had for the space of ten years resisted the Roman arms, he encountered at last the displeasure of his countrymen, and was accused of having embezzled some of the plunder of this place. Being well aware how the matter would terminate, Camillus went into voluntary exile, although his friends offered to pay the sum demanded of him. During this period of separation from his country, Rome, with the exception of the Capitol, was taken by the Gauls under <ref type="cross" target="crossbrennus">Brennus</ref> (q.v.). Camillus, though an exile, was invited by the fugitive Romans at Veii to take command of them, but refused to act until the wishes of the Romans besieged in the Capitol were known. These unanimously revoked the sentence of banishment, and elected him dictator. The noble-minded Roman forgot their previous ingratitude, and marched to the relief of his country; which he delivered, after it had been for some time in the possession of the enemy. The Roman account says that Camillus, at the head of an army of forty thousand men, hastened to Rome, where he found the garrison of the Capitol on the point of purchasing peace from the invaders. “With iron, and not with gold,” exclaimed Camillus, “Rome buys her freedom.” An attack was instantly made upon the Gauls, a victory obtained, and the foe left their camp by night. On the morrow Camillus overtook them, and they met with a total overthrow. His triumphal entry into Rome was made amid the acclamations of thousands, who greeted him with the name of Romulus, Father of his Country, and Second Founder of the City. After performing another equally important service, in prevailing upon his countrymen to rebuild their city and not return to Veii, and after gaining victories over the Aequi, Volsci, Etrurians, and Latins, he died <cb /> in the eighty-ninth year of his age, having been five times dictator, once censor, three times interrex, twice military tribune, and having obtained four triumphs ( <title>Camill.;</title> <bibl n="Liv.  5. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.v. 46</bibl> foll.; <bibl n="Flor.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.i. 13</bibl>;  <bibl n="Verg.

We have touched on merely a few of the events connected with the history of Camillus, in consequence of the strong suspicion which attaches itself to the greater part of the narrative. In no instance, perhaps, have the family memorials of the Roman aristocracy more completely usurped the place of true history than in the case of Camillus. The part relative to the overthrow of the Gauls appears to be pure fiction. See Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, bk. ii. ch. 4.

 <p> A district of Italy, the name of which is probably derived from <seg lang="la">campus</seg>, “a plain.” It was separated from Latium by the river Liris, and from Lucania at a later time by the river Silarus, though in the time of Augustus it did not extend farther south than the promontory of Minerva. In still earlier times, the “Ager Campanus” included only the country around Capua. Campania is a volcanic country, to which circumstance it mainly owed the extraordinary fertility for which it was celebrated in antiquity above all other lands. The fertility of the soil, allowing in parts three crops in a year, the beauty of the scenery, and the softness of the climate, the heat of which was tempered by the delicious breezes of the sea, procured for Campania the epithet Felix, a name which it justly deserved. It was the favourite retreat in summer of the Roman nobles, whose villas studded a considerable part of its coast, especially in the neighbourhood of <ref type="cross" target="crossbaiae">Baiae</ref> (q.v.). The earliest inhabitants of the country were the Ausones and the Osci or Opici. These were subsequently conquered by the Etruscans, who became the masters of almost all the country. In the time of the Romans we find three distinct peoples, besides the Greek population of Cumae: (1) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Campāni</hi>, properly so called, a

<div2 id="crosscampus-martius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Campus Martius">Campus Martius</head>

 <p> The term <seg lang="la">campus</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">κάμπος</foreign>) belongs to the language of Sicily, in which it signified a hippodrome or race-course; but among the Romans it was used to denote an open plain, covered with herbage, and set apart for the purpose of exercise or amusement. Eight of these plains are enumerated by P. Victor as appertaining to the city of Rome, among which the most celebrated was the Campus Martius, so called because it was consecrated to the god Mars. Some difference exists between Livy and Dionysius Halicarnassus respecting the period at which this consecration took place. The former states that upon the expulsion of the Tarquins the people took possession of their property (<title>ager Tarquiniorum</title>), situated between the city and the Tiber, and assigned it to the god of war, by whose name it was subsequently distinguished; whereas the latter says that the Ager Tarquiniorum had been usurped from that divinity, to whom it belonged of old, and appropriated by the Tarquins, so that it was only restored to its original service upon their expulsion, a statement which gains confirmation from a law of Numa, quoted by Festus, <title>secunda spolia in Martis aram in campo solitaurilia utra voluerit caedito.</title></p>
 <p>From the greater extent and importance of this plain beyond all the others, it was often spoken of as “the plain,” <foreign lang="greek">κατ ἐξοχήν</foreign>, without any epithet to distinguish it; and, therefore, whenever the word is so used, it is the Campus Martius which is to be understood as always referred to.</p>
 <p>The general designation, Campus Martius, comprised two plains, which, though generally spoken of collectively, are sometimes distinguished. The former of these was the so-called Ager Tarquiniorum, to which Juvenal refers, <title>inde Superbi Totum regis agrum;</title> the other was given to the Roman people by the vestal virgin Gaia Taratia or Suffetia, and is sometimes called Campus Tiberinus, and sometimes Campus Minor.</p>
 <p>It is difficult to determine the precise limits of the Campus Martius, but in general terms it may be described as situated between the Via Lata and Via Flaminia on the north, the Via Recta on the south; as bounded by the Tiber on the west, and <cb /> the Pantheon and gardens of Agrippa towards the east; and the Campus Minor, or Tiberinus, occupied the lower portion of the circuit towards the Via Recta, from the Pons Aelius to the Pons Ianiculensis. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspons">Pons</ref>.</p>
 <p>That the Campus Martius was originally without the city is apparent—first, from the passages of Livy and Dionysius above referred to; secondly, from the custom of holding the Comitia Centuriata there, which could not be held within the Pomoerium; hence the word <seg lang="la">campus</seg> is put for the comitia, which also explains the expression of Cicero, <seg lang="la">fors domina campi</seg>, and of Lucan, <seg lang="la">venalis campus</seg>, which means “the corrupt voters”; thirdly, because the generals who demanded a triumph, not being allowed to enter the city, remained with their armies in the Campus Martius; and, finally, because it was not lawful to bury within the city, whereas the monuments of the illustrious dead were among the most striking ornaments with which it was embellished. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>.) But it was included in the city by Aurelian when he enlarged the walls.</p>
 <p>The principal edifices which adorned this famous plain are described by Strabo. It was covered with perpetual verdure, and was a favourite resort for air, exercise, or recreation when the labours of the day were over. Its ample area was crowded by the young, who there initiated themselves in all warlike and athletic exercises, and in the games usual to the palaestra; for which purpose the contiguous Tiber rendered it peculiarly appropriate in early times, before public baths were established. Hence <seg lang="la">campus</seg> is used as “a field” for any exercise, mental or bodily. Wooden horses were also kept in the Campus Martius— under porticos in winter, and in the open plain during summer—in order to give expertness in mounting and dismounting; a necessary practice when stirrups were not in use (Veget. i. 23). Horse-races (<seg lang="la">equiria</seg>) also took place here, except when the Campus was overflowed. The Campus Martius is the most densely populated portion of modern Rome.

 <p>The method of constructing conduits is described by Vitruvius (viii. 7), who distinguishes the canalis, which is lined with masonry (<seg lang="la">structilis</seg>), from the leaden <seg lang="la">fistula</seg> and the earthenware <seg lang="la">tubulus.</seg> A ruder kind of conduit was made of timber or earthenware to carry water from a spring or stream to cattle in a meadow.

 <p>Similarly <seg lang="la">canalis</seg> denotes the channel of a sewer, as, for instance, that in the Forum, which is at one spot exposed to view, and was a favourite station for loungers (<bibl n="Pl. Cur. 4.1.15" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Curc.</title> iv. 1, 15</bibl>).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κιγκλίδες, δρύφακτοι</foreign>). A screen or lattice of open work, placed before a window, a doorway, the tribunal of a judge, or any other place. At Athens, in the Senate-house and lawcourts <foreign lang="greek">δρύφακτοι</foreign> were the inner partition, and <foreign lang="greek">κιγκλίδες</foreign> the gates opening into it. Balconies projecting from the fronts of houses were also <foreign lang="greek">δρύφακτοι</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi>). The material was originally wood, as the name <foreign lang="greek">δρύφακτος</foreign> shows (L. and S. s. v.); and such were also the cancelli put up at Rome for temporary purposes, as when funeral games were given in the Forum (<seg lang="la">cancelli fori</seg>, <title>pro Sest.</title> 58. 124; cf.  <bibl n="Ov.

 conjecturally restored by Lanciani from existing remains, or in marble. In the Basilica Iulia, low marble screens or cancelli shut in the otherwise open arches on the ground floor; and a great number of fragments of these screens are now scattered about the Forum.</p>
 <p>Hence was derived the word <seg lang="la">cancellarius</seg>, which originally signified a porter who stood at the latticed or grated door of the emperor's palace. The cancellarius also signified a legal scribe or secretary who sat within the cancelli, or latticework, by which the crowd was kept off from the tribunals of the judges (Cassiod. <bibl n="Cic. Var. 11. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Var.</title>xi. 6</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κανδάκη</foreign>). A name given to the queenmothers in Meroë in Aethiopia. Some women of this name appear in history, but they seem to have been merely queen-regents, governing during the minority of their sons. Some ancient authors, however, state that it was customary for the Aethiopians to be governed by queens called each by the name of Candacé. Suidas speaks of a Candacé who was made prisoner by Alexander the Great, but this appears to be a mere fable. A Candacé, blind of one eye, made an irruption into Egypt during the reign of Augustus, B.C. 22. She took and pillaged several cities, but Petronius, the prefect of Egypt, pursued her and penetrated into her dominions, which he pillaged in turn, until she restored the booty which she had carried off from Egypt, and sued for peace (Dio Cass. lxiv. 5;  <bibl n="Plin.

<head orig="Candelābrum">Candelabrum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">λυχνεῖον, λυχνίον, λύχνιον, λυχϝία</foreign>). Originally a candlestick, but afterwards used to support lamps (<foreign lang="greek">λυχνοῦχος</foreign>), in which signification the word most commonly occurs. The candelabra of this kind were usually made to stand upon the ground, and were of a considerable height. The most common sorts were made of wood ( <title>ad Q. Fratr.</title> iii. 7); but those which have been <cb /> found in Herculaneum and Pompeii are mostly of bronze. Sometimes they were made of the more precious metals, and even of jewels, as was the one which Antiochus intended to dedicate to Iupiter Capitolinus ( <title>Verr.</title> iv. 28). In the temples of the gods and in palaces there were frequently large candelabra made of marble and fastened to the ground.</p>
 <p>There is a great resemblance in the general plan and appearance of most of the candelabra which have been found. They usually consist of three parts: (1) the foot (<foreign lang="greek">βάσις</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(2) the shaft or stem (<foreign lang="greek">καυλός</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(3) the plinth or tray (<foreign lang="greek">δισκός</foreign>), large enough for a lamp to stand on, or with a socket to receive a wax candle. The foot usually consists of three lions' or griffins' feet, ornamented with leaves; and the shaft, which is either plain or fluted, generally ends in a kind of capital on which the tray rests for supporting the lamp. Sometimes we find a figure between the capital and the tray, as is seen in the candelabrum on the right hand in the annexed illustration, which represents <figure id="fig.00266">
<head orig="Pompeian Candelabra. (Naples.)">Pompeian Candelabra. (Naples.)</head>
</figure> candelabra found in Pompeii, and now in the Museo Nazionale at Naples. The one on the left hand is also a representation of a candelabrum found in the same city, and is made with a sliding shaft, by which the light might be raised or lowered at pleasure.</p>
 <p>The best candelabra were made at Aegina and Tarentum ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 6</bibl>).</p>
 <p>There are also candelabra of various other forms, though those which have been given above are by far the most common. They sometimes consist of a figure supporting a lamp, or of a figure by the side of which the shaft is placed with two branches, each of which terminates in a flat disk, upon which a lamp was placed. A candelabrum of the

 latter kind is given in the preceding illustration. The stem is formed of a liliaceous plant; and at the base is a mass of bronze, on which a Silenus is seated, engaged in trying to pour wine from a skin which he holds in his left hand, into a cup in his right.</p>
 <p>There was another kind of candelabrum, entirely different from those which have been described, which did not stand upon the ground, but was placed upon the table. These candelabra usually consist of pillars, from the capitals of which sev<figure id="fig.00267.2">
<head orig="Pompeian Candelabrum. (Naples.)">Pompeian Candelabrum. (Naples.)</head>
</figure> eral lamps hang down, or of trees, from whose branches lamps also are suspended. The preceding illustration represents a very elegant candelabrum of this kind, found in Pompeii.</p>
 <p>The original, including the stand, is three feet high. The pillar is not placed in the centre, but at one end of the plinth, which is the case in almost every candelabrum of this description yet <cb /> found. The plinth is inlaid in imitation of a vine, the leaves of which are of silver, the stem and fruit of bright bronze. On one side is an altar with wood and fire upon it, and on the other a Bacchus riding upon a tiger.

The citadel, however, was preserved, and the circumstance of its occupation by Hannibal seems to have been regarded by the Romans of sufficient importance to cause them considerable uneasiness and annoyance. It commanded, indeed, all the adjacent country, and was their principal southern depot of stores and provisions. The Greek writers, especially Polybius, generally use the name in the singular, <foreign lang="greek">Κάννα</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The decisive victory at Cannae was owing to three combined causes: the excellent arrangements of Hannibal, the superiority of the Numidian horse, and the skilful manoeuvre of Hasdrubal in opposing only the light-armed cavalry against that of the Romans, while he employed the heavy horse, divided into small parties, in repeated attacks on different parts of the Roman rear. The Roman army contained 80,000 infantry and 6000 cavalry, the Carthaginians 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. Hannibal drew up his forces in the form of a convex crescent, having his centre thrown forward before the wings. He commanded the <cb /> centre in person, and here he had purposely stationed his worst troops; the best were posted at the extremities of each wing, which would enable them to act with decisive advantage as bodies of reserve, they being, in fact, the rear of the other forces. Hasdrubal commanded the left wing, Hanno the right. On the Roman side, want of union between the two consuls, and want of spirit among the men, afforded a sure omen of the fortune of the day. Aemilius commanded the right, Varro the left wing; the proconsuls, Regulus and Servius, who had been consuls the preceding year, had command of the centre. What Hannibal foresaw took place. The charge of the Romans, and their immense superiority in numbers, at length broke his centre, which, giving way inward, his army now assumed the shape of a concave crescent. The Romans, in the ardour of pursuit, were carried so far as to be completely surrounded. Both flanks were assailed by the veterans of Hannibal, who were armed in the Roman manner; at the same time the cavalry of the Carthaginians attacked their rear, and the broken centre, rallying, attacked them in front. The consequence was that they were nearly all cut to pieces. The two proconsuls, together with Aemilius the consul, were slain. Varro escaped with seventy horse to Venusia. The Romans lost on the field of battle 70,000 men; and 10,000 who had not been present in the fight were made prisoners. The Carthaginian loss amounted to 5500 infantry and 200 cavalry. Such is the account of Polybius, whose statement of the fight is much clearer and more satisfactory than that of Livy. Hannibal has been censured for not marching immediately to Rome after the battle, in which city all was consternation. But an explanation of his conduct may be found under the article <ref type="cross" target="crosshannibal">Hannibal</ref>. See also the account in DodgeCol.

<head orig="Canon Alexandrīnus">Canon Alexandrinus</head>

 <p> The so-called Alexandrian Canon, arranged by Aristophanes of <ref type="cross" target="crossbyzantium">Byzantium</ref> (q.v.) and his disciple <ref type="cross" target="crossaristarchus">Aristarchus</ref> (q.v.). The daily increasing multitude of books of every kind had become so great that there was no expression, however faulty, for which precedent might not be found; and as there were far more bad than good writers, the authority and weight of numbers were likely to prevail, and the language, consequently, to grow more and more corrupt. It was thought necessary, therefore, to draw a line between those classic writers to whose authority an appeal in matter of language might be made and the common herd of inferior authors. In the most cultivated modern tongues it seems to have been found expedient to erect some such barrier against the inroads of corruption; and to this preservative caution we are indebted for the vocabulary of the Academicians della Crusca, and the list of authors therein cited as affording <seg lang="la">testi di lingua.</seg> To this, also, we owe the great dictionaries of the Academies of France and Spain of their respective languages. But as for the example first set in this matter by the Alexandrian critics, its effects upon their own literature have been of a doubtful nature. In so far as the Canon has contributed to preserve to us some of the best authors included in it, we can not but rejoice. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that the comparative neglect into which those not received into it were sure to fall has been the occasion of the loss of a vast number of writers who would have been, if not for their language, yet for their matter, very precious; and who, perhaps, in many cases, were not easily to be distinguished, even on the score of style, from those that were preferred.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Martianus Mineus Felix</hi>. A poet, born, according to Cassiodorus, at Madaura in Africa; he calls himself, however, at the end of his work, “the foster-child of the city of Elissa”; whether it be that he was born at Carthage, or else received his education there, which latter is the more probable opinion of the two. The MSS., however, give him the title of “the Carthaginian.” In process of time he attained to proconsular dignity, but whether he was a Christian or not is a matter of uncertainty. About the middle of the fifth century of our era he wrote at Rome a work bearing the appellation of <title>Satira</title> or <title>Satyricon</title>, divided into nine books. It is a species of encyclopaedia, half prose and half verse, modelled after the Varronian satire. The first two books form a detached and separate work, entitled <title>De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</title>, and treating of the apotheosis of Philology and her marriage with Mercury. We find in it, among other things, a description of heaven, which shows that the mystic notions of the Platonists of that day approximated in a very singular manner to the truths of Christianity. In the seven following books Capella treats of the seven sciences which formed at that time the circle <cb /> of human study—namely, grammar, logic, rhetoric, geometry, astrology (astronomy), arithmetic, and music, which comprehends poetry. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliberales-artes">Liberales Artes</ref>.) This work, written in an exaggerated and pedantic style, was introduced into the schools in the Middle Ages; hence it was frequently copied, and the text has become extremely corrupt. The prosody shows that accent had begun to destroy the distinction of quantity, for we find, e. g., <title>lōquax, flăgitaret, Canŏpus</title>, etc. On the text, see Dick, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Martiano Capella Emendando</title> (Berne, 1885)</bibl>.

 <p> (1) A surname of Iupiter, from his temple on the Mons Capitolinus.</p>
 <p>(2) A surname of M. <ref type="cross" target="crossmanlius">Manlius</ref> (q.v.), who, for his ambition in aspiring to sovereign power, was thrown down from the Tarpeian Rock, which he had so nobly defended ( <bibl n="Flor.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.i. 13</bibl> and 26).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mons</hi>, one of the seven hills on which Rome was built, containing the citadel and fortress of the Capitol. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitolium">Capitolium</ref>.) Three ascents led to its summit from below. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) By the 100 steps of the Tarpeian Rock, which was probably on the steepest side, where it overhangs the Tiber. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Clivus Capitolinus</hi>, which began from the Arch of Tiberius and the Temple of Saturn, near the modern Hospital of the Consolazione, and led to the citadel by a winding path. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Clivus Asȳli</hi>, which, being less steep than the other two, was, on that account, the road by which the triumphant generals were borne in their cars to the Capitol. This ascent began at the Arch of Septimius Severus, and from thence, winding to the left, passed near the ruined pillars of the Temple of Concord, and from thence led to the Intermontium. The Capitoline Hill is said to have been previously called Saturnius, from the ancient city of Saturnia, of which it was the citadel. Afterwards it was known by the name of Mons Tarpeius, and finally it obtained the appellation first mentioned, from the circumstance of a human head (<seg lang="la">caput</seg>) being discovered on its summit, in making the foundations of the Temple of Iupiter. It was considered as forming two summits, which, though considerably depressed, are yet sufficiently apparent. That which looked to the south and the Tiber was the Tarpeian Rock or citadel, the other, which was properly the Capitol, faced the north and the Quirinal. The space which was left between these two elevations was known by the name of Intermontium. See <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Roma</ref>.

 <p> A celebrated temple and citadel at Rome, on the Tarpeian Rock. The foundations were laid by Tarquinius Priscus, <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 139, B.C. 615. Its walls were raised by his successor Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus finished it, 
<pb n="272" /><cb /> a.u.c. 231, B.C. 533. It was not, however, consecrated until the third year after the expulsion of the kings. This ceremony was performed by the consul Horatius. It covered eight acres, was 200 feet broad, and about 215 long. It consisted of three parts, a nave sacred to Iupiter, and two wings or aisles, the right sacred to Minerva, and the left to Iuno. The ascent to it from the Forum was by a hundred steps. The magnificence and richness of this temple are almost incredible. All the consuls successively made donations to the Capitol, and Augustus bestowed upon it at one time 2000 pounds weight of gold. The gilding of the whole arch of the Temple of Iupiter, which was undertaken after the destruction of Carthage, cost, according to Plutarch, 21,000 talents, or $24,780,000. The gates of the temple were of brass, covered with large plates of gold. The interior was all of marble, and was adorned with vessels and shields of solid silver, with gilded chariots, etc. The Capitol was burned in the time of Sulla , <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 670, B.C. 83, through the negligence of those who kept it, and Sulla rebuilt it, but died before the dedication, <figure id="fig.00272">

It was again destroyed in the troubles under Vitellius, on the 19th of December, A.D. 69; and Vespasian, who endeavoured to repair it, saw it again in ruins at his death. Domitian raised it for the last time, and made it more grand and magnificent than had any of his predecessors, and spent 12,000 talents in gilding it.

<head orig="Capitŭlum">Capitulum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκρανον, κιονόκρανον</foreign>). The capital of a column, which, in the infancy of building as an art, was nothing more than a simple abacus, or square tablet of wood, placed on the top of a wooden trunk, the original column, to form a broad bed for the architrave to rest upon. From this simple beginning, it became eventually the principal ornament of a column, and a prominent feature by which the different architectural orders are distinguished; being, like them, and strictly speaking, divided into three kinds, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian capitals, which, with the Roman alterations, make five varieties in use among the ancients; for the Tuscan is only a species of Doric; and the Composite is formed by a union of the Ionic and Corinthian, having the foliage of the latter surmounted by the volutes of the former — a bastard capital introduced in the Imperial Age, when the genius for invention was succeeded by <figure id="fig.00272.2">

The example is from a Roman temple near Albano.

<head orig="Cappadŏcia">Cappadocia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καππαδοκία</foreign>). A district of Asia Minor, to which different boundaries were assigned at different times. Under the Persian Empire it included the whole country inhabited by a people of Syrian origin, who were called (from their complexion) White Syrians (Leucosyri), and also Cappadoces. Their country embraced the whole northeast part of Asia Minor, east of the river Halys and north of Mount Taurus, which was afterwards divided into Pontus and Cappadocia proper. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspontus">Pontus</ref>.) When this division took place is uncertain; but we find that under the Persian Empire the whole country was governed by a line of hereditary satraps, who eventually became independent kings. At a later period Cappadocia proper was governed by a line of independent monarchs. In A.D. 17, Archelaüs, the last king, died at Rome, and Tiberius made Cappadocia a Roman province. Cappadocia was a rough and mountainous region. Its fine pastures supported an abundance of good horses and mules.

 <p> (dim. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Capsŭla, Capsella</hi>) or <hi rend="bold">Scrinium.</hi> A box for holding books and papers among the Romans, usually made of beech-wood and of a cylindrical form.

 <p>There does not appear to have been any difference between the capsa and the scrinium, except that the latter word was usually applied to those boxes which held a considerable number of rolls (Martial, i. 2. 4).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καπύη</foreign>). A rich and flourishing city, the capital of Campania until ruined by the Romans. Its original name was Vulturnum, which was 
<pb n="274" /><cb />
 changed by the Tyrrheni, after they became masters of the place, to Capua. This latter name was mythically derived from that of their leader Capys, who, according to Festus, received this appellation from his feet being deformed and turned inward. The name is not of Latin, but probably of Oscan origin. The Latins, however, pretended, notwithstanding, to ascribe the foundation of the city to Romulus, who named it, as they stated, after one of his ancestors. Capua was the chief city of the southern Tyrrheni, and even after it fell under the Roman dominion continued to be a powerful and flourishing place. Capua deeply offended the Romans by opening its gates to Hannibal after the victory of <ref type="cross" target="crosscannae">Cannae</ref> (q.v.), though the luxury and debauchery of the place did much to impair the energy of his troops who wintered there. The vengeance inflicted by Rome upon the Capuans was, however, of a most fearful nature, when, five years after, the city again fell under its dominion. Most of the senators and principal inhabitants were put to death, the greater part of the remaining citizens were sold into slavery, and by a decree of the Senate the Capuani ceased to exist as a people. The city and territory, however, did not become thereupon deserted. A few inhabitants were allowed to remain in the former, and the latter was in a great measure sold by the <figure id="fig.00274">

 <head><surname full="yes">Caracalla</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Aurelius Antonīnus Bassiānus</foreName>
 <p>The eldest son of Septimius Severus. His name Caracalla was derived from a species of Gallic cassock which he introduced at Rome; and that of Bassianus from his maternal grandfather. Caracalla was born at Lugdunum (Lyons), A.D. 188, and was appointed by his father to be his colleague in the government at the age of thirteen years; yet he is said, even at this early age, to have attempted his father's life. Severus died A.D. 211, and was succeeded by his two sons, Caracalla and Geta. These two brothers bore towards each other, even from infancy, the most inveterate hatred. After a campaign against the Caledonians, they concluded a disgraceful peace and then wished to divide the Empire between them; but their design was opposed by their mother, Iulia, and by the principal men of the State; so that Caracalla now resolved to get rid of his brother, by causing him to be assassinated. After many unsuccessful attempts, he pretended to desire a reconciliation, and requested his mother to procure him an interview with his brother in her own apartment. Geta appeared, and was stabbed in his mother's arms, A.D. 212, by several centurions, who had received orders to this effect. The praetorian guards were prevailed upon, by rich donations, to proclaim Caracalla sole emperor, and to declare Geta an enemy to the State; and the Senate confirmed the nomination of the soldiers. After this, the whole life of Caracalla was only one series of cruelties and acts of extravagant folly. All who had been in any way connected with Geta were put to death, not even their children being spared. The historian Dio Cassius makes the whole number of victims to have amounted to 20,000 (Dio Cass. lxxvii. 4). Among those who <cb /> fell in this horrible butchery was the celebrated lawyer Papinianus. And yet, after this, by a singular act of contradiction, he not only put to death many of those who had been concerned in the murder of his brother, but even demanded of the Senate that he should be enrolled among the gods. His pattern was Sulla , whose tomb be restored and adorned. Like this dictator, he enriched his soldiers with the most extravagant largesses which extortion enabled him to furnish. The augmentation of pay received by them is said to have amounted to 280 millions of sesterces a year. As cruel as Caligula and Nero, but weaker than either, he regarded the Senate <figure id="fig.00275.2">
<head orig="Caracalla. (Vatican.)">Caracalla. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> and people with equal hatred and contempt. From motives of avarice, he gave all the freemen of the Empire the right of citizenship, and was the first who received Egyptians into the Senate. Of all his follies, however, the greatest was his admiration of Alexander of Macedon. From his infancy he made this monarch his model, and copied him in everything which it was easy to imitate. He had even a Macedonian phalanx of sixteen thousand men, all born in Macedonia, and commanded by officers bearing the same names with those who had served under Alexander. Convinced, moreover, that Aristotle had participated in the conspiracy against the son of Philip, he caused the works of the philosopher to be burned. With equally foolish enthusiasm for Achilles, he made him the object of his deepest veneration. He went to Ilium to visit the grave of Homer's hero, and poisoned his favourite freedman, named Festus, to imitate Achilles in his grief for Patroclus. His conduct in his campaigns in Gaul, where he committed all sorts of cruelties, was still more degrading. He crossed over the Rhine into the countries of the Catti and Alemanni. The Catti defeated him, and permitted him to repass the river only on condition of paying them a large sum of money. He next marched through the land of the Alemanni as an ally, and built several fortifications. He then called together the young men of the tribe, as if he intended to take them into his service, and caused his own troops to surround them and cut them in pieces. For this barbarous exploit he assumed the surname of Alemannicus. In Dacia he gained some advantages over the Goths. He signed a treaty of peace at Antioch with Artabanus, the Parthian king, who submitted to all his demands. He invited Abdares, the king of Edessa, an ally of the Romans, to Antioch, loaded him with chains, and took possession of his estates. He exercised the same treachery towards Vologeses, king of Armenia; but the Armenians flew to arms and repulsed the Romans. After this, Caracalla went to Alexandria, to punish the people of that city for ridiculing him. While preparations were making for a great massacre, he offered hecatombs to Serapis, and visited the

</figure>
 tomb of Alexander, on which he left his imperial ornaments by way of offering. He afterwards devoted the inhabitants for several days and nights to plunder and butchery, and seated himself, in order to have a view of the bloody spectacle, on the top of the Temple of Serapis, where he consecrated the dagger which he had drawn, some years before, against his own brother. His desire to triumph over the Parthians induced him to violate the peace, under the pretence that Artabanus had refused him his daughter in marriage. He found the country undefended, ravaged it, marched through Media, and approached the capital. The Parthians, who had retired beyond the Tigris to the mountains, were preparing to attack the Romans the following year with all their forces. Caracalla returned without delay to Mesopotamia, without having even seen the Parthians. When the Senate received from him information of the submission of the East, they decreed him a triumph and the surname Parthicus. Being informed of the warlike preparations of the Parthians, he prepared to renew the contest; but Macrinus, the praetorian prefect, whom he had offended, assassinated him at Edessa, A.D. 217, on his way to the Temple of Lunus. His reign had lasted more than six years. It is remarkable that this prince, although he did so much to degrade the throne of the Caesars, yet raised at Rome some of the most splendid structures that graced the capital. Magnificent thermae bore his name (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">Balneae</ref>), and among other monuments of lavish expenditure was a triumphal arch, on which were represented the victories and achievements of his father, Severus, and of which an illustration is given on page 118. Notwithstanding his crimes, Caracalla was deified after death by a decree of the Senate.

<head orig="Caractăcus">Caractacus</head>

 <p> A king of the Silures in Britain, a people occupying what is now southern Wales. After withstanding, for the space of seven years (A.D. 43-50) the Roman arms, he was defeated in a pitched <cb /> battle by Ostorius Scapula, and his forces put to the rout. Taking refuge, upon this, with Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantes, he was betrayed by her into the hands of the Romans, and led to Rome. Great importance was attached to his capture. Claudius, who was emperor at the time, augmented the territories of Cartismandua, and triumphal honours were decreed to Ostorius. This exploit was compared to the capture of Syphax by Scipio, and that of Perseus by Aemilius Paulus. The manly and independent bearing, however, of the British prince, when brought into the presence of the Roman emperor, excited so much admiration that his fetters were removed, and freedom was granted him, together with his wife and children, who had shared his captivity. There is no evidence that Caractacus ever returned to Britain, and he is believed to have been in Rome at the time of his death ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 12. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xii. 33</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>Tradition says that the Claudia mentioned by St. Paul (2 <bibl n="Tim.  4. 21" default="NO">Tim.iv. 21</bibl>) was his daughter and introduced Christianity into Britain, but there is no historical evidence to support this legend. Caractacus is believed to have died in A.D. 54.

The finest cotton came from Egypt, where the priests wore cotton garments; and from Arabia. Caecilius Statius mentions cotton at Rome as early as B.C. 180, and later it was used not only for articles of clothing, but for tentcurtains, awnings, sails, etc. (See Plin. <bibl n="Plin.

<head orig="Carcer">Carcer</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δεσμωτήριον</foreign>). A prison.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. Imprisonment was seldom used among the Greeks as a legal punishment for offences. Among the Athenians, with whom we are chiefly concerned, it was practically unknown in the sense of confinement for a definite period after conviction. They had neither the appliances in the shape of walls and bars, nor were they willing to incur the expense; and they preferred either banishment or the death penalty. Capital punishment was inflicted without hesitation for comparatively trifling offences, but by more humane methods than those of modern Europe until quite recent times.</p>
 <p>Imprisonment before trial, on the other hand, was common enough, though bail was freely accepted in cases other than capital; the terror of exile was in general thought sufficient to keep a man to his bail (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγγύη</foreign>). The farmers of the taxes and lessees of other revenues (<foreign lang="greek">τελῶναι, μισθούμενοι</foreign>), as well as their sureties (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ ἐγγυώμενοι</foreign>), were liable to imprisonment if the duties were not paid by a specified time; and in cases where default was to be feared, they might even be imprisoned at the discretion of the Senate or law-courts. This was the great safeguard to insure regularity of payment. Again, persons who had been mulcted in penalties might be confined till they paid them, not only in criminal cases, but in some civil actions instituted for damages as well. Certain of the <foreign lang="greek">ἄτιμοι</foreign> also, if they exercised the rights of citizenship, were subject to the same consequences (Demosth. <title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 732. 103). We read, moreover, of <foreign lang="greek">δεσμός</foreign> as a public stigma put upon disgraceful offences, such as theft; but this was a <foreign lang="greek">προστίμημα</foreign> or additional penalty, the infliction of which was <cb /> at the option of the court; and the <foreign lang="greek">δεσμός</foreign> itself was not so much an imprisonment as a public exposure in the <foreign lang="greek">ποδοκάκκη</foreign> or stocks, for five days and nights—called also <foreign lang="greek">ἐν ξύλῳ δεδέσθαι</foreign> (Demosth. <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, p. 700. 2; pp. 732-733. 103, 105; p. 736.114). One more description of imprisonment remains to be noticed, that in the interval between condemnation and execution. In this last case, owing to the insecurity of the building, the prisoner was chained, and was under the special custody of the Eleven, who were also responsible for the execution itself. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshendeka">Hendeka</ref>.</p>
 <p>There are several passages from which we might infer the existence at Athens of imprisonment as a punishment by itself—e. g. Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 37C" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>37 C</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Laws 9. 864" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Laws</title>, ix. 864</bibl>E, 880 B, and especially x. 908. But such vague allusions prove nothing against the persistent silence of the historians and orators. “Of imprisonment as a punishment by itself,” Schömann argues, “we have no certain example”; and this remark in his text is supported by a good note (<title>Antiq.</title> i. 489, Eng. trans.). The opposite and less probable opinion has, however, been maintained by K. F. Hermann (<title>Staatsalterth.</title> 139) and Caillemer (<hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Daremberg and Saglio).</p>
 <p>The prison at Athens is frequently mentioned in the orators, both by its usual name, <foreign lang="greek">δεσμωτήριον</foreign>, and the euphemistic equivalent <foreign lang="greek">οἴκημα</foreign>. But the plural <foreign lang="greek">δεσμωτήρια</foreign> does not seem to occur in any Attic writer, though there are passages where, if a plurality of prisons existed at Athens, we should almost certainly find them mentioned. This argument seems almost decisive in favour of the opinion of J. H. Lipsius (<title>Att. Process</title>, p. 73 n.), that there was only one. The authority of Hesychius and the <title>Etymologicum Magnum</title> is insufficient to prove, in the face of probability, that there was an Athenian prison called <foreign lang="greek">Θησεῖον</foreign>; and there is no proof that the other names for prisons recorded by the grammarians are to be referred to Athens. Among these local names was <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκαῖον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκαιον</foreign> in Boeotia, <foreign lang="greek">κέραμος</foreign> in Cyprus, <foreign lang="greek">κῶς</foreign> at Corinth; and among the Ionians <foreign lang="greek">γοργύρη</foreign>, as at Samos ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 145" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 145</bibl>); <foreign lang="greek">βάλαικες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">βαλαίκακες, βλέορον<bibl n="Hdt.  i" default="NO" valid="yes">ηεροδ., ι</bibl>ψον, σιρός</foreign>, all mentioned by Hesychius. The appearance of the Latin <seg lang="la">carcer</seg> in the Sicilian Greek <foreign lang="greek">κάρκαρον</foreign>, and conversely of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">λατομίαι</foreign> in the Latin <seg lang="la">lautumiae</seg>, is noticed by Mommsen as a proof of the early intercourse between the Romans and Sicily (<title>R. H.</title> i. 167, Eng. trans.). Some of the above names may be slang or nicknames, such as are often applied to prisons in our own day: thus <foreign lang="greek">γοργύρα</foreign> is explained to mean “a sewer”; <foreign lang="greek">ἴψον</foreign> may be connected with <foreign lang="greek">ἶπος</foreign>, “a mouse-trap.” The gate through which criminals were led to execution was called <foreign lang="greek">χαρώνειον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θύρα χαρώνειος</foreign> ( <bibl n="Poll.  8. 102" default="NO">Poll.viii. 102</bibl>), a grim joke which can hardly have arisen at Athens, where executions were private.</p>
 <p>The Attic expression for imprisonment was <foreign lang="greek">δεῖν</foreign>, a word which by no means implies the use of chains or fetters. The phrase in the oath of the <foreign lang="greek">βουλευταί</foreign>, or senators, <foreign lang="greek">οὐδὲ δήσω Ἀθηναίων οὐδένα</foreign>, is explained by Demosthenes (<title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 746. 147) as a security against arbitrary imprisonment by the executive government without trial. It was, in fact, the habeas corpus of the Athenian constitution. But he is careful to add ( 151) that no such words occur in the oath of the Heliastae or dicasts; the law-courts had absolute power 
<pb n="278" /><cb />
 over men's lives, liberties, and fortunes. We have also the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἄδεσμος φυλακή</foreign> (as in <bibl n="Thuc.  3. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iii. 34</bibl>), like the <seg lang="la">libera custodia</seg> of the Romans, signifying that a person was under strict surveillance and guard, though not confined within the walls of a prison.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The oldest prison at Rome, traditionally the only one in early times ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 312" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 312</bibl>), was called simply Carcer; and is still to be seen on the eastern slope of the Capitoline Hill, to the right of the ascent from the Forum. The name Mamertinus, usually applied to the Carcer, is mediaeval and not classical. The Tullianum consists of a larger oblong upper and a smaller underground circular dungeon; the latter is that called the Tullianum, a name which has often been incorrectly explained. As the original erection of the <figure id="fig.00278">
<head orig="Section of the Tullianum at Rome.">Section of the Tullianum at Rome.</head>
</figure> Carcer was attributed to Ancus Marcius (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 33</bibl>), it was conjectured by the etymologists that the name Tullianum must have been derived from Servius Tullius, “evidently a double mistake, as the lower chamber would certainly not have been added after the upper one” (Middleton, <title>Anc. Rome</title>, p. 80). It is now agreed that it is from the <hi rend="italic">tullii</hi>, or springs for whose waters it formed a reservoir; that it was built in the first instance simply to protect the water supply of the Capitol; and was only in later times used as a part of the prison when a captive, as in the well-known instance of Iugurtha, was doomed to be killed by cold and starvation (Festus and P. Diac. s. v. <hi rend="italic">tullii</hi>, pp. 352-353, Müller;  <bibl n="Plut. Mar. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Mar.</title>12</bibl>; Burn, <title>Rome and the Campagna</title>, p. 81). The name therefore originally meant “wellhouse.” Thus Livy speaks of the infamous Pleminius as <title>deiectus in Tullianum</title> (xxix. 22), which in another passage is expressed by the words <seg lang="la">in inferiorem demissus carcerem necatusque</seg> (xxxiv. 44). It was here, too, that Lentulus and the other accomplices of Catiline were strangled by order of the <seg lang="la">triumviri capitales;</seg> and Sallust describes it as sunk twelve feet in the earth, strongly walled, and with a roof vaulted with stone arches ( <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 55" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>55</bibl>). In reality, as modern investigations have shown, the construction is so old that it points to a time when the arch was not used in Roman architecture, standing next among existing remains to the prehistoric walls on the Palatine; the roof being of stone slabs, each overlapping the one beneath it, an approximation to the true arch found also <cb /> in the well-known treasury of Mycenae and other primitive buildings. The upper chamber is also of very early date, but later than the Tullianum; and it is not in its primitive condition. A projecting string-course on the outside records a restoration in the reign of Tiberius by the <seg lang="la">consules suffecti</seg> for the year A.D. 22. Another name for this part of the prison was Robur, in old Latin Robus. The Robur is spoken of as a place of execution in several passages (<bibl n="Liv.  38. 59" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxviii. 59</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 29</bibl>), and is spoken of by Middleton as “the scene of countless butcheries and slow torture such as the Romans delighted in.” During each triumph, in his course up to the Capitol, the victorious general paused for a while near the Tullianum till word was brought him that some of his principal captives had been put to death in its gloomy vault. The Scalae Gemoniae (called by Gradus GemitoriiPliny , “stair of sighs”) led from the Forum to the door of the upper prison, and here the dead bodies of Sabinus, of Vitellius, of Seianus, and many other noted persons were exposed. (Cf. Tac. <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 3. 74" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>iii. 74</bibl><bibl n="Sal. Hist. 85" default="NO" valid="yes"> Hist., 85</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>61</bibl>; <title>Vitell.</title> 17; and the touching story in Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8. 145" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>viii. 145</bibl>, of the faithful dog who there watched his master's body night and day and brought it food.)</p>
 <p>The name Robur was given to the Tullianum from the oaken beams (<seg lang="la">robora</seg>) that lined it in early times. Plutarch (<title>Marius</title>, 12) calls the lower dungeon <foreign lang="greek">τὸ βάραθρον</foreign>. A tradition of the Roman Church makes St. Peter and St. Paul to have been imprisoned here in the time of Nero, and declares the spring which still exists to have sprung up miraculously for the baptism of the jailers by St. Peter. The building has therefore been named S. Pietro in Carcere. See Middleton, <title>Remains of Ancient Rome</title>, i. pp. 151 foll., where a plan and section are given <bibl default="NO">(London, 1892)</bibl>; and Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, i. 308 <bibl default="NO">(American ed. 1888)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Sallust, in the passage already cited, gives an impressive picture of the lower vault in which Iugurtha and also Vercingetorix perished. “There is,” he says, “in the prison a chamber named the Tullianum, about twelve feet below the surface of the earth. It is surrounded by walls, and covered by a vaulted roof of stone; but its appearance is repulsive and fearful, because of the neglect, the darkness, and the stench.” Access to the lower dungeon was originally possible only through the hole in the ceiling. The exact proportions of the vault are 19 feet in length, 10 feet in width, and 6 1/2 feet in height.</p>
 <p>The name Mamertinus, often applied to this prison, was bestowed upon it in the early part of the Middle Ages from a statue of Mars (Mamers) which stood near it on the Clivus Argentarius. From the same statue is derived the modern name of the street, Via del Marforio.</p>
 <p>This prison was obviously too small to contain any number of prisoners, and probably from the first was appropriated to those condemned to death. The earliest mention of another prison is in the days of the Decemvirate, B.C. 450. Appius Claudius is said to have built one for political purposes, to overawe the champions of plebeian liberties (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 57</bibl>). It was into this prison that he was himself thrown, and committed suicide while awaiting his trial. At a later period we find an additional prison called Lautumiae, or stone-quarries, 
<pb n="279" /><cb /> in the immediate neighbourhood of the original Carcer. It is not likely that there were ever any quarries on this spot, which was to the northwest of the Forum; but it may have been named after the Syracusan <foreign lang="greek">λατομίαι</foreign> mentioned above, which were thus used. Varro (<title>L. L.</title> v. 151, Müll.) identified the Lautumiae with the Tullianum, and has been followed by some of the moderns; but they are distinguished by the best writers on Roman topography (Becker, <title>Röm. Alterth.</title> i. 262-268; Burn, p. 80).</p>
 <p>With the growth of the city other prisons became necessary; but the words of Roman historians generally refer to these alone. Close to the Carcer, and between it and the Temple of Concord, were the Scalae <ref type="cross" target="crossgemoniae">Gemoniae</ref> (q.v.), where the bodies of criminals were exposed after execution.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θαιρός, στροφεύς, στρόφιγξ, γίγγλυμος</foreign>). A hinge, a pivot.</p>
 <p>The first figure in the annexed illustration is designed to show the general form of a door, as we find it with a pivot at the top and bottom (<seg lang="la">a b</seg>) in ancient remains of stone, marble, wood, and bronze. The second figure represents a bronze hinge in the Egyptian collection of the British Museum; its pivot (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) is exactly cylindrical. Under these is drawn the threshold of a temple, or other large edifice, with the plan of the folding-doors. The pivots move in holes fitted to receive them (<seg lang="la">b b</seg>), <cb /> each of which is in an angle behind the antepagmentum. When Hector forces the gate of the Grecian camp, he does it by breaking both the <figure id="fig.00279.2">

</figure> hinges (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφοτέρους θαιρούς</foreign>) —i. e., as explained by the scholiasts, the pivots (<foreign lang="greek">στρόφιγγας</foreign>) at the top and bottom. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscataracta">Cataracta</ref>.</p>
 <p>According to the ancient lexicons, <seg lang="la">cardo</seg> denoted not only the pivot, but sometimes the socket (<seg lang="la">foramen</seg>) in which it turned. <title>Postis</title> appears to have meant the upright pillar (<seg lang="la">a b</seg>) in the frame of the door. The whole of this “post,” including the pivots, appears to be called <foreign lang="greek">στροφεύς</foreign> and <seg lang="la">cardo</seg> by Theophrastus and Pliny , who say that it was best made of elm, because elm does not warp, and because the whole door will preserve its proper form, if this part remains unaltered.</p>
 <p>The Greeks and Romans also used hinges exactly like those now in common use. Four Roman hinges of bronze, preserved in the British Museum, are shown in the following illustration. <figure id="fig.00279.3">
<head orig="Cardines. (British Museum.)">Cardines. (British Museum.)</head>

 <p>The proper Greek name for this kind of hinge was <foreign lang="greek">γίγγλυμος</foreign>: whence Aristotle applies it to the joint of a bivalve shell; and the anatomists call those joints of the human body <hi rend="italic">ginglymoid</hi> which allow motion only in one plane, such as the elbowjoint.</p>
 <p>The form of the door above delineated makes it manifest why the principal line laid down in surveying land was called <seg lang="la">cardo</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossagrimensores">Agrimensores</ref>); and it further explains the application of the same term to the North Pole, the supposed pivot on which the heavens revolved (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Pont. 2.10.45" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Epist. ex Pont.</title> ii. 10, 45</bibl>). The lower extremity of the universe was conceived to turn upon another pivot, corresponding to that at the bottom of the door; and the conception of these two principal points in geography and astronomy led to the application of the same term to the east and west also. Hence our “four points of the compass” are called by ancient writers <seg lang="la">quatuor cardines orbis terrarum;</seg> and the four principal winds, N., S. , E., and W., are the <seg lang="la">cardinales venti</seg> ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καρία</foreign>). A district of Asia Minor, in its southwestern corner. It is intersected by low mountain chains, running out far into the sea in long promontories, forming gulfs along the coast and inland valleys that were fertile and well-watered. The chief products of the country were corn, wine, oil, and figs. The coast was inhabited chiefly by Greek colonists. The inhabitants of the rest of the country were Carians, a people nearly allied to the Lydians and Mysians. The Greeks considered the people mean and stupid, even for slaves. The country was governed by a race of native princes, who fixed their abode at Halicarnassus. These princes were subject-allies of Lydia and Persia, and some of them rose to great distinction in war and peace. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossartemisia">Artemisia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmausolus">Mausolus</ref>.) Under the Romans, Caria formed a part of the province of Asia. As the Carians were often used as mercenaries, the proverb arose <foreign lang="greek">ἐν Καρὶ κινδυνεύειν</foreign>, equivalent to the familiar Latin <seg lang="la">experimentum facere in corpore vili.</seg> Cf. the scholiast on Plato, <title>Laches</title>, 187 B; and Polyb. x. 32, 11.</p>

 <p>The eldest son of the emperor Carus, who gave him the title of Caesar and the rank of Augustus, together with the government of Italy, Illyricum, Africa, and the West, when he himself was setting out, with his second son Numerianus, to make war against the Persians. Carus, knowing the evil qualities of Carinus, gave him this charge with great reluctance; but he had <figure id="fig.00280">
<head orig="Carinus.">Carinus.</head>
</figure> <cb /> no alternative, as Numerianus, though superior in every respect to his elder brother, was too young to hold so important a command. As soon as Carinus entered Gaul, which his father had particularly charged him to defend against the barbarians, who menaced an irruption, he gave himself up to the most degrading excesses, discharged the most competent men from public employment, and substituted the vile companions of his debaucheries. On hearing of the death of his father, he indulged in new excesses and new crimes. Still, however, his courage and his victories merit praise. He defeated the barbarians who had begun to attack the Empire, among others the Sarmatae, and he afterwards overthrew Sabinus Inlianus, who had assumed the purple in Venetia. He then marched against Diocletian, who had proclaimed himself emperor after the death of Numerian. The two armies met in Moesia, and several engagements took place, in which success seemed balanced. At last a decisive battle was fought near Margum, and Carinus was on the point of gaining a complete victory, when he was slain by a tribune of his own army, who had received an outrage at his hands. This event took place A.D. 285, so that the reign of Carinus, computing it from his father's death, was a little more than one year. His life was written by Vopiscus.

This was a race, in which one of the runners, supposed to symbolize the blessings of harvest, started in advance, uttering prayers for the city. The others, called “vintagerunners,” pursued him, and if they overtook him the occurrence was taken as a good omen; if they failed, as a bad one.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Καρνεάδης</foreign>). A philosopher of Cyrené in Africa, founder of a sect called the Third or New Academy. The Athenians sent him with Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaüs the Peripatetic, as ambassador to Rome, B.C. 155. Carneades excelled in the vehement and rapid, Critolaüs in the correct and elegant, and Diogenes in the simple and modest, kind of eloquence. Carneades, in particular, attracted the attention of his new anditory by the subtlety of his reasoning and the fluency of his language. Before Galba and Cato the Censor, he harangued with great variety of thought and copiousness of diction in praise of justice. The next day, to establish his doctrine of the uncertainty of human knowledge, he undertook to refute all his former arguments. Many were captivated by his eloquence; but Cato , apprehensive lest the Roman youth should lose their military character in the pursuit of Grecian learning, persuaded the Senate to send back these philosophers, without delay, to their own schools.</p>
 <p>Carneades obtained such high reputation at home that other philosophers, when they had dismissed their scholars, frequently came to hear him. It was the doctrine of the New Academy that the senses, the understanding, and the imagination frequently deceive us, and therefore can not be infallible judges of truth; but that, from the impression which we perceive to be produced on the mind by means of the senses, we infer appearances of truth or probabilities. He maintained that these do not always correspond to the real nature of things, and that there is no infallible method of determining when they are true or false, and consequently that they afford no certain criterion of truth. Nevertheless, with respect to the conduct of life, Carneades held that probable appearances are a sufficient guide, because it is unreasonable that some degree of credit should not be allowed to those witnesses who commonly give a true report. He maintained that all the knowledge the human mind is capable of attaining is not science, but opinion. He died in B.C. 129. See <ref type="cross" target="crossnew-academy">New Academy</ref>.

 <p> A cart; also a rectangular twowheeled carriage, enclosed, and with an arched or sloping cover overhead.</p>
 <p>The carpentum was used to convey the Roman matrons in the public festal processions; and, as this was a high distinction, the privilege of riding in a carpentum on such occasions was allowed to particular women by special grant of the Senate. This was done on behalf of Agrippina, who availed herself of the privilege so far as even to enter the Capitol in her carpentum ( <bibl n="Tac.

The convenience and stateliness of the carpentum were also assumed by magistrates, and by men of luxurious habits, or those who had a passion for driving. When Caligula instituted games and other solemnities in honour of his deceased mother, Agrippina, her carpentum went in the procession ( <title>Calig.</title> 15).</p>
 <p>Carpenta, or covered carts, were much used by the Britons, and by the Gauls, the Cimbri, the Allobroges, and other Northern nations ( <bibl n="Flor.  1. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.i. 18</bibl><seg lang="la">et al.</seg>). These, together with the carts of the more common form, including baggage-wagons, appear to have been comprehended under the term <seg lang="la">carri</seg> or <seg lang="la">carra</seg>, which is the Keltic name with a Latin termination. The Gauls and Helvetii took a great multitude of them on their military expeditions; and, when they were encamped, arranged them in close order, so as to form extensive lines of circumvallation ( <title>B. G.</title> i. 24, 26).</p>
 <p>The agricultural writers use <seg lang="la">carpentum</seg> to denote either a common cart or a cart-load—e. g. <seg lang="la">xxiv stercoris carpenta</seg> (Pallad. x. 1).

<head orig="Carthāgo">Carthago</head>

 <p> A rich and powerful city on the northern coast of Africa, the capital of one of the greatest empires of antiquity. The Roman name Carthago and the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Καρχηδών</foreign> are both corruptions of the native Punic Kirjath-Hadeshath, or “New Town,” so called to distinguish it from Tyre, or possibly from the earlier settlement at <ref type="cross" target="crossutica">Utica</ref> (q.v.)</p>
 <p>Carthage was situated on the peninsula forming the northeast corner of modern Tunis, but topographers differ in their views of the exact locality. One school holds that the city occupied the north of the peninsula, while the other school places its site upon the southern portion. The most generally accepted view is the latter.</p>
 <p>An important feature of the city was the hill with its citadel (Byrsa), surrounded by walls, and approached by a series of sixty steps. On the land side a triple wall, on which were mounted <figure id="fig.00283.2">
<head orig="Plan of Tyrian Carthage.">Plan of Tyrian Carthage.</head>
</figure> towers and casemates, surrounded the city, and afforded shelter for 300 elephants and some 4000 horses. Two artificial harbours—one rectangular, for merchant vessels, opening into the Bay of Tunis, and with a narrow passage that could be closed by chains, and a second circular harbour for ships of war—gave Carthage access to the sea. The second harbour (<title>Kothon</title>) contained in its centre an island with the official residence of the naval commander-in-chief. Although these harbours are now much diminished in size, their situation is still readily identified. Between the lagoon and the sea a strip of land, called by Roman writers the Taenia, is also plainly to be recognized to-day. Beyond the walls of the city was the beautiful suburb of Magalia or Megara (now Mara), and still farther a great necropolis of sepulchres strongly built and carefully preserved.</p>
 <p>The people of Carthage were members of the 
<pb n="284" /><cb />
 great Semitic race, and belonged to the Phoenician branch, since Carthage was settled (probably about the middle of the ninth century B.C.) either by a colony directly sent from the Phoenician city of Tyre, or from the Tyrian offshoot, Utica. They were closely akin to the Canaanites who held Palestine before the Jewish invasion, and their language resembled the Hebrew. Because of their generally known Phoenician origin, the Romans called them Poeni or Punici, from <foreign lang="greek">Φοίνικες</foreign>, signifying “the Red Men,” or perhaps referring to the palms (<foreign lang="greek">φοίνικες</foreign>), the symbol of the Syrian coast. The name <title>Sarranus</title>, given to Phoenician wares, serves also to connect the Poeni with their original Syrian home (Sil. Ital. ix. 319).</p>
 <p>Carthage was the youngest of the Phoenician colonies in the northern territory of Africa, the earlier ones being Utica, Tunis, and Hadrumetum, in the district of Zeugitana, Hippo, and Leptis. Over all these, which were once independent of her, Carthage finally attained at once commercial and political supremacy. The history of this gradual rise to power is unknown, for no historical notices earlier than the sixth century B.C. are now available; and at that period Carthage was already the centre and the capital of a mighty empire, extending from the borders of Cyrené to the Straits of Gibraltar, and holding as provinces the Balearic Islands, Malta, <ref type="cross" target="crosssardinia">Sardinia, and some settlements on the coast of Spain and Gaul. An immense revenue flowed into the coffers of the State from the rich grain lands of Emporia and Byzacium southeast of the city, and commerce extending over the known world brought wealth to the citizens. South of the African coast, the power of Carthage extended as far as Lake Tritonis</ref> (q.v.), which was connected by a canal with the Lesser Syrtis. Besides the Carthaginians of pure Phoenician descent, the aristocracy of the Empire, three other classes of subjects are mentioned. These are: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the Libyo-Phoenicians, a mixed race, the offspring of intermarriages between the Libyans and the original Phoenician settlers; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the Libyans, an entirely different race from the Phoenicians, and to some extent ignorant even of the Punic language; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the Nomads, who lived on the borders of the Empire towards the south, and professed an allegiance of a doubtful sort to the government of Carthage. The Libyo-Phoenicians formed the agricultural class, tilling the fields in Zeugitana; but were regarded with a certain suspicious dislike by the Carthaginians of pure blood, much as the Mexican gentry of unmixed Spanish lineage regard their fellow-countrymen of mixed descent. The Libyans, who were the original owners of the soil, and had been dispossessed by the Phoenician colonists, formed the bulk of the Carthaginian army; but the harsh treatment which they received, and perhaps the remembrance of their former ownership of the land, made them discontented, and, at times, mutinous. The Nomads furnished Carthage with a fierce and warlike irregular cavalry; yet their loyalty was always uncertain, and, in fact, it was by their aid that Rome finally subdued the Carthaginian people.</p>
 <p>The commercial and maritime enterprise of the people of Carthage was remarkable in antiquity. They were great navigators and explorers. One of their admirals, <ref type="cross" target="crosshanno">Hanno</ref> (q.v.), as early as the sixth century B.C., sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar out into the Atlantic, passed down the <cb /> western coast of Africa, entered the Senegal (Chretes?), and having reached a bay supposed to be on the southern borders of Sierra Leone, returned only when compelled to do so by the difficulty of provisioning his ship. A Greek MS. in the library of Heidelberg University professes to be the translation of the account which Hanno placed among the archives kept in the great Temple of Molech at Carthage. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossafrica">Africa</ref>.) A little later, a second Carthaginian, one Himilco, is believed to have visited the northern coasts of Europe. <figure id="fig.00284">

</figure></p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Religion</hi>.—The religion of the Carthaginians, like that of the other Canaanitish peoples, was a form of fire-worship. As with all Semites, the rites and practice of religion formed a part of the daily life, and profoundly influenced the development of their civilization. Their chief god, Molech, represented the destructive influence of the sun, and in his temples human victims were immolated with fire. These victims were usually prisoners taken in war, but not always, for when Agathocles besieged the city, we are told that 200 noble children belonging to native families were offered up to secure the favour of the god. The moon-goddess Tanith or Tanist (Tanis) appears to have been identical with Ashtaroth, Melkart with Heracles, and a seagod whom the Greeks identified with Poseidon was probably the same as the Philistine deity, Dagon. Rites in honour of deified heroes were celebrated, while animals—e. g. the lion, bull, serpent, etc.—and such of the Greek divinities as the Carthaginians had heard of in Sicily also received special worship. There is no evidence that the priests formed a separate caste, confined to certain families. On the contrary, sacrifices appear to have been offered by the magistrates and military leaders. The inscriptions and bas-reliefs thus far discovered and studied afford no confirmation of the charges made by the Greek and Roman writers, that the Carthaginians were guilty of obscene and unnatural practices in the conduct of their worship; and it is probable that the statements of the Christian Fathers refer to Roman and not to Phoenician Carthage. The morality of the Carthaginians, in fact, appears to have been originally of even an ascetic character, as befitted an industrious and largely agricultural people (Aristot. <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>i. 5</bibl>). The Phoenician theory of cosmogony was given by a native author, Sanchoniathon, born either at Tyre or Berytus in the tenth century B.C., who wrote in Phoenician a history in nine books, containing an account of the theology and antiquities of Phoenicia, and of the neighbouring states. This work was translated into Greek under Hadrian by Philo of Byblus, and of it some fragments have been preserved in the history of Eusebius of Caesarea. An interesting summary of the substance of these fragments is given in Davis's <title>Carthage</title>, pp. 199-205 <bibl default="NO">(N. Y. 1861)</bibl>. 
<pb n="285" /><cb /></p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Government</hi>.—The form of government at Carthage, which Aristotle praises for its stability and for its success in securing the general happiness and prosperity of the people, was aristocratic in its constitution (Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> ii. 8). The principal magistrates (<seg lang="la">suffetes</seg>, <hi rend="italic">Heb. sophetim</hi>) have been compared to both the Roman consuls and the Spartan kings. Their number, however, is not definitely known, nor the extent of their term of office. They were eligible for re-election. A Senate, elected by popular vote, participated in the government with the <seg lang="la">suffetes</seg>, and was filled largely from the ranks of the wealthy. There appears to have been a sort of referendum to the people when the <seg lang="la">suffetes</seg> and the Senate disagreed upon any course of action. There existed also, side by side with the regular governmental organization, a power which, like that of the Spartan ephors, gradually gained the real control of the State. This was the highest aristocracy, which elected bodies of commissions (pentarchies) so constituted that the outgoing members preserved their power for another year, and thus impressed upon the institution a consistent and symmetrical policy. These pentarchies elected a council of 104 members, who at last usurped the authority of the State; though Hannibal succeeded in checking their power, and in restoring to the people some real share in the government.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—The history of Carthage falls naturally into four periods: (1) from the foundation of the city to the beginning of the wars with Syracuse, B.C. 410;</p>
 <p>(2) to the beginning of the war with Rome, B.C. 265;</p>
 <p>(3) to the destruction of the city by the Romans, B.C. 146;</p>
 <p>(4) from the restoration of the city to its final destruction by the Arabs, A.D. 698.</p>
 <p>The foreign conquests of Carthage were undertaken with the object of securing her commerce. Justin tells us of a king, Malchus (the Latin form of the royal title), who, after successes in Africa and Sicily, was defeated in Sardinia, and turned his arms against his country. He must have lived between B.C. 600 and 550. A more historical personage is his successor Mago (between B.C. 550 and 500), said to be the founder of the military power of the Carthaginians. His sons were Hasdrubal and Hamilcar, his grandsons Hannibal, Hasdrubal, and Sappho, sons of Hasdrubal, and Himilco, Hanno , and gisco, sons of Hamilcar. By the energy of this family the Carthaginian Empire was established over Sardinia, which was not lost till after the First Punic War, over the Balearic Islands and part of Sicily, and over portions of Liguria and Gaul. There are, however, few events of which the chronology is certain. The first is the seafight between the Etruscans and Carthaginians on the one hand and the Phocaeans of Aleria in Corsica on the other, which occurred in B.C. 536. The Phocaeans, driven from Asia Minor by Harpagus in 564, had settled at Aleria or Alalia in Corsica, but engaged in piracy, which demanded the interference of the commercial naval powers. The Phocaeans won the battle, but with such loss that they abandoned Corsica, and settled at Velia in Italy. Polybius has preserved three treaties between Carthage and Rome, the first of which belongs to the year B.C. 509, the second probably to the period between B.C. 480 and 410. Their object is to restrict Roman commerce in Punic waters, and it is <cb /> noticeable that the second treaty prescribes stricter limits than the first, and testifies to a considerable superiority of Carthage over Rome. To the period of about B.C. 500 belong the expeditions of Hanno and Himilco—the one to found colonies on the west coast of Africa, which was probably explored as far as the mouths of the Senegal and Gambia, the other to obtain a knowledge of the Atlantic, which resulted in the discovery of Britain. But the most important event of the first period was the battle of Himera, fought between Hamilcar and Gelo of Syracuse, about the year B.C. 480. Terillus, tyrant of Himera, on the north coast of Sicily, driven out by Thero of Agrigentum, implored and obtained help from the Carthaginians. Thero was assisted by Gelo of Syracuse. An account of this battle is given by Herodotus. The forces of Hamilcar consisted of 3000 ships and 300,000 men—Phoenicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligurians, Helysci (perhaps Volscians), Sardinians, and Corsicans. He was defeated with great loss. <figure id="fig.00285">
<head orig="Carthaginian Warrior. (Cabinet de France.)">Carthaginian Warrior. (Cabinet de France.)</head>
</figure> For seventy years the Carthaginians made no further effort for the subjugation of Sicily. This battle is one of the most important in ancient history. The expedition in which it terminated was undertaken in conjunction with that of the Persians against the Greeks of Attica. The nearly simultaneous defeats at Himera and Salamis decided the question whether Semitic or Aryan nations should hold the empire of the West. The only other events of any importance in this period of which we have an account are the more complete subjugation of the African dependencies by the family of Mago, and the settlement of the disputed boundary between Carthage and Cyrené.</p>
 <p>The second period of 140 years (B.C. 410-269) is occupied with the attempts of Carthage to reduce Sicily to the condition of a subject province. At this time her settlements were confined to the 
<pb n="286" /><cb />
 western corner of the island, while on the eastorn coast Syracuse undertook the defence of Grecian nationality, and waged the battle of Aryans against Semites, until both combatants fell before the supremacy of Rome. The repulse of the Athenians from Syracuse, and the same rivalry between Egesta and Selinus which had invited Athenian interference in the affairs of the island, induced the Carthaginians to renew an enterprise which had been interrupted for seventy years. Hannibal, son of Giso, stormed Selinus, and avenged at Himera the death of his grandfather. Overtures of peace were rejected, and preparations made for a more vigorous attack. In 406, Hannibal and Himilco destroyed the great city of Agrigentum, overthrew the mighty columns of her temples, and covered a flourishing site with a mass of ruins. Hannibal died before Agrigentum; Himilco proceeded to attack Gela. Syracuse was now governed by Dionysius, who from an obscure position had raised himself to the rank of despot. In 405, a treaty made by Carthage secured to her the possession of her conquests, and to Dionysius a firmer position on the throne. But he no sooner felt himself secure than he hastened to drive the enemy from the island. War broke out in 398, all Sicily fell before the Punic arms, and Dionysius, driven by Himilco to take refuge within the walls of Syracuse, was there besieged. Pestilence came to his assistance, and the Carthaginians were defeated; 150,000 Punic corpses lay unburied on Grecian soil; and Himilco, unable to bear the contempt of his fellow-citizens, starved himself to death. The Libyans rose in rebellion, and Carthage was threatened by an army of 200,000 men. The attempt of Mago, between 396 and 392, to procure a more favourable result had little effect. Ten years afterwards he led another expedition. The defeat of Cabala nearly lost the possession of the whole of Sicily, but the brilliant victory of Corsica restored the balance, and the Halycus was accepted as the boundary between the two peoples. Fourteen years of peace ensued. In 368, the misfortunes of Carthage encouraged Dionysius to a new but unsuccessful effort to complete the purpose of his life, but his death put an end to a renewal of the attempt, and his son and successor made peace with the Carthaginians. The weak government of Dionysius II. was favourable to the extension of Carthaginian Empire in Sicily; but they found an antagonist of different mettle in the Corinthian Timoleon, who, after liberating Syracuse from its tyrants, made war against Carthage for six years (B.C. 345-340). The defeat of the Crimissus (B.C. 340) was most crushing. The Holy Legion, composed of 2500 men of the best families of Carthage, was destroyed, and the host of mercenaries cut to pieces. Peace restrained the Carthaginians within their old boundary of the Halycus; the Greek cities were declared free; and Carthage promised never again to support a despot in Syracuse. The next thirty years contain little of note except traces of friendly intercourse between Carthage and Rome, and a record of assistance given to the Tyrians when besieged by Alexander the Great. She, however, sent ambassadors to Babylon to congratulate the conqueror on his return from Asia. <ref type="cross" target="crossagathocles">Agathocles</ref> (q.v.) was the first to discover that the secular enemies of his countrymen were vulnerable in Africa. After becoming despot of <cb /> Syracuse, and establishing his authority over the great towns in Sicily, he found that he had to reckon with the Carthaginians. Unsuccessful in the island, he transferred his forces to the mainland in 310, reduced Carthage to the last extremities, and would probably have obtained more signal success had not the revolt of Agrigentum called him home. Peace made in 306 continued till the death of Agathocles in 289. His loss encouraged the extension of Punic dominion, and at last obliged the Syracusans to call in the assistance of Pyrrhus, the chivalrous king of Epirus. He left Italy in 277, and in a short time drove the Carthaginians from the west and besieged them in the distant fortress of Lilybaeum. But his allies were untrue to him. Carthage and Rome were leagued against him. He left Sicily in 276, and his departure from Italy in the following year left the Carthaginians to stand in sharp antagonism to the Latin branch of the Aryan stock.</p>
 <p>The third period of Carthaginian history extends from B.C. 264 to 146—from the outbreak of the first war with Rome to the final annihilation of the city by the conquerors. This is not the place for a detailed account of the Punic wars, which occupy a large space in every Roman history. We must content ourselves with a hasty summary. The first war, which lasted from B.C. 264 to 241, was a contest for the possession of Sicily. The Carthaginians in undertaking it felt secure of their mastery over the sea. Their ambassadors told the Romans that they could not even wash their hands in the sea without permission of the Carthaginians. Montesquien considers it one of the chief causes of the rise of Roman greatness that they were careful to borrow from their enemies whatever was calculated to improve their own efficiency. The Romans not only built a fleet, but developed a novelty of tactics which precisely secured the object which they had in view. They were encouraged to further exertion by the victories of B.C. 260 and B.C. 256, and were schooled to caution by the defeat of the following year. The war was practically ended by the brilliant success of Catulus in B.C. 242, and Sicily was lost to the Carthaginians. The next three years and a half (241-237) were occupied by a civil war, which shows us on what insecure foundations the power of Carthage was based. The large army of mercenaries which had been employed against Rome was incautiously admitted into the city. Under pretence of demanding pay they rose against their employers, and were joined by the Libyans and Numidians, who cultivated the surrounding lands in unwilling subjection. The insurrection was quelled with difficulty, but a similar revolution in Sardinia was more successful—700 Carthaginians were barbarously murdered, and the possession of the island passed to the Romans. All we know of the twenty years which elapsed before the beginning of the second war with Rome is confined to the successes of Hamilcar and his family in Spain. In B.C. 218, Hannibal, who had sworn as a boy eternal enmity to the Romans, began the enterprise to which he devoted his life. His object was not so much to conquer Italian soil or Italian cities as to break up the confederacy upon which the greatness of Rome depended, and to undo the fabric of its empire stone by stone. He sought, therefore, on the one hand to rouse Greeks and Orientals to a joint attack upon the 
<pb n="287" /><cb />
 common foe, and on the other to sow dissension among the Latin, Sabellian, and Oscan tribes, and to urge them to reduce Rome to that position of comparative inferiority which she had occupied many centuries before. Both these plans failed. Hannibal was badly supported from home; he found that to combine in unity the shifting policy of the East was to weave a rope of sand; and he discovered, above all, that Roman supremacy was established on a basis of complete security. Far different, in fact, was her position, seated among kindred peoples bound to her by affinities of blood and language as well as interest, governed by the wise policy of a patriotic Senate, and restrained by the overpowering force of devoted legions, from that of the city of merchants, torn by factions, surrounded by alien and even hostile tribes, defended by mercenaries, and swayed by interest and passion. The defeat of Hasdrubal at the Metaurus in B.C. 207 crushed the last hope of the invader; Spain was recovered by the genius of Scipio; and in B.C. 203, Hannibal, not unwillingly, obeyed the order to embark from Italy to retard the ruin of his country which it was too late to save. The battle of Zama, in 202, put an end to the war in the following year. It was due to the magnanimity of Scipio and Hannibal that peace was concluded on such terms that, while Rome had no longer to fear Carthage as a rival, she was content to recognize her existence as a commercial community.</p>
 <p>For the next six years, Hannibal governed the city which he had not been able to preserve. He reformed the constitution in a democratical sense, and paid with surprising facility the enormous indemnity demanded by Rome. He was engaged in planning a combination against Rome with Antiochus of Syria when he was driven from power, and forced to take refuge in the East, where shortly afterwards he fell a victim to Roman hatred.</p>
 <p>The interval between B.C. 183 and 150 contains little besides the history of internal dissensions— struggles between the Roman party, the democratical party, and the party of Masinissa, which tore the city in sunder by their quarrels. The socalled Third Punic War (B.C. 149-146) is one of the saddest events in all history, and the greatest blot upon the reputation of the Romans. Jealousy of their old antagonists had been shown by constant acts of injustice, and at last the sight of the prosperity and riches of the city impressed upon the narrow mind of Cato the conviction that Carthage must be blotted out. A pretext for war was wantonly invented. The anxieties of the Carthaginians to secure peace at any sacrifice was made the instrument of their destruction. When they saw that their ruin was resolved upon, and that compromise was hopeless, they defended themselves with an energy which would have saved them at an earlier period. The sentence of the Roman Senate was ruthlessly carried out. The city burned for seventeen days, and concealed its very site under a heap of ashes. The plough was passed over it, and the ground was cursed forever. In the words of Mommsen, “where the industrious Phoenicians bustled and trafficked for five hundred years, Roman slaves henceforth pastured the herds of their distant masters.”</p>
 <p>The history of Roman Carthage, which constitutes the fourth period, can be given in a few <cb /> words. In B.C. 122, Gracchus led 6000 colonists to Africa, and founded the city of Iunonia. The colony did not prosper. In B.C. 29, a second colony (Colonia Carthago) was sent out by Augustus in fulfilment of a design of Iulius Caesar. This became so prosperous that Herodian declares it to have disputed with Alexandria the second place in the Empire. In the middle of the fifth century, it became, under Genseric, the capital of the Vandal kingdom (439), and in A.D. 533 it was stormed by Belisarius. In A.D. 698, it was entirely destroyed by the general of the calif Abd-ul-Melek.</p>
 <p>For centuries after this final destruction, the site of Carthage was a quarry for both the Africans and for the merchants of Europe. Genoese vessels, trading with Tunis in the Middle Ages, seldom returned without a cargo of Carthaginian marble. The cathedral of Pisa is even said to have been built out of the ruins of Carthage. Recent times, also, have aided in the work of devastation, since the marble blocks of the ancient walls have been within the last few years in part destroyed by the operations of the Tunisian railway. The aqueduct, over fifty miles in length, is the only remnant of the greatness of the city's past that still preserves a real impressiveness.</p>

 <p>A Roman emperor, who succeeded Probus. He was first appointed, by the latter, praetorian prefect, and after his death was chosen by the army to be his successor, A.D. 282. Carus created his two sons, Carinus and Numerianus, Caesars, as soon as he was elevated to the Empire, and, some time after, gave them each the title of Augustus. On the news of the death of Probus, the barbarians put themselves in motion, and Carus, sending his son Carinus into Gaul, departed with Numerianus for Illyricum, in order to oppose the Sarmatae, who threatened Thrace and Italy. He slew 16,000, and made 20,000 prisoners. Proceeding after this against the Persians, he made himself master of Mesopotamia, and of the cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, and took in consequence the surnames of Persicus and Parthicus. He died, however, in the midst of his successes, A.D. 283. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaper">Aper</ref>.) His whole reign was one of not more than sixteen or seventeen months.

<div2 id="crosscasaubon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Casaubon</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Isaac</foreName>
 <p>A great classical scholar of the sixteenth century, born at Geneva, February 15th, 1559. When only twenty-four years of age, he was appointed professor of Greek at Geneva, from which town he was called in 1596 to a like chair at Montpellier. In 1598, he became royal librarian at Paris; but on the death of Henry IV. this position became insecure by reason of his Protestantism, and in 1610 he removed to England, where he was received with great favour by James I., who made him prebendary of Canterbury and Westminster. Casaubon was bitterly attacked by many as having sold his conscience for preferment, and thus becoming the hired advocate of James. In 1614, he wrote his <title>Exercitationes contra Baronium</title>, in criticism of the <title>Annales Ecclesiastici</title> of Cardinal Baronius.</p>
 <p>Casaubon was a scholar of great application, retentiveness, and candour; indefatigable in research, and with an excellent faculty of illustration. He had by unwearied labour acquired a vast fund of information, and his diffuse and exhaustive commentaries show how richly stored a mind he possessed. He represents the non-Ciceronian school of sixteenth-century Latinity to which Scaliger and Lipsius also belonged, these three being known as the “Triumvirate” by their contemporaries. The works of Casaubon comprise the treatises <bibl default="NO"><title>De Satirica Graeca Poësi et Romanorum Satira</title> (1605)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>De Libertate Ecclesiastica</title> (1607)</bibl>; the <title>Exercitationes</title> already mentioned; and annotated editions of Strabo <bibl default="NO">(1587)</bibl>; Dionysius Hal. <bibl default="NO">(1588)</bibl>; Aristotle <bibl default="NO">(1590)</bibl>; Pliny 's Letters <bibl default="NO">(1591)</bibl>; Theophrastus <bibl default="NO">(1592)</bibl>; Diogenes Laertius <bibl default="NO">(1593)</bibl>; Suetonius <bibl default="NO">(1595)</bibl>; Theocritus <bibl default="NO">(1596)</bibl>; Athenaeus <bibl default="NO">(1598- 1600)</bibl>; the Augusta <bibl default="NO">(1603)</bibl>; Persius <bibl default="NO">(1605)</bibl>; Polybius <bibl default="NO">(1609)</bibl>; and the <seg lang="la">edit. prin.</seg> of Polyaenus. Of these the most ambitious work is the commentary upon Athenaeus, in the preparation of which he spent ten years. Perhaps the most valuable is the Persius, which Scaliger enthusiastically styled “divine.” Casaubon died in London, July 1st, 1614. His life has been written by Mark Pattison <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1875)</bibl>, of which a second edition, edited by Prof. Nettleship, appeared in 1892.

A short time before the battle of Pharsalia he had burned the entire fleet of the enemy, amounting to thirty-five ships, in the harbour of Messana. The news of Pompey's defeat, however, deterred him from pursuing his advantages; and, resigning the contest, he submitted to Caesar in Asia Minor, when the latter was returning from Egypt into Italy. Cicero, however, asserts that at this very time Cassius had intended to assassinate the man whose clemency he was <cb /> willing to solicit, had not an accident prevented the accomplishment of his purpose (<title>Philipp.</title> ii. 11). He was not only spared by Caesar, but was appointed by him one of his lieutenants, a favour bestowed by magistrates upon their friends, in order to invest them with a public character, and thus enable them to reside or to travel in the provinces with greater comfort and dignity. Even during the last campaign of Caesar in Spain, Cassins wrote to Cicero, saying that he was anxious that Caesar should be victorious, for that he preferred an old and merciful master to a new and cruel one ( <title>Ep. ad Fam.</title> xv. 19). He also, together with Brutus, was appointed one of the praetors for the year 709, at a moment in which he was entirely discontented with Caesar's government; and he is said to have been the person by whose intrigues the first elements of the conspiracy were formed. Cassius had married Iunia, the sister of Brutus, and it was partly through her means that he made his approaches, when seeking to gain over her brother and induce him to join in the plot. After the assassination of Caesar, Cassius, together with Brutus, raised an army, and was met by Octavius and Antony at Philippi. The wing which Cassius commanded being defeated, he imagined that all was lost, and killed himself, B.C. 42. Brutus gave him an honourable burial, and called him, with tears, the last of the Romans.</p>

Varius, who had been sent for that purpose by Octavianus. He must not be confounded with Cassius the Etrurian, who appears to have been a very rapid and poor writer.</p>

 <p> (1) A Roman camp, fortified with a rampart and a ditch, outside of which a Roman army never spent a single night. It was marked out on a place selected for the purpose, generally upon the spur of a hill. The same plan was always observed, and the quarters were indicated by coloured flags and lances, so that the divisions of the army, as they came in, could find their places at once. In the middle of the second century B.C., according to the account of Polybius (vi. 27), the plan of a camp for a consular army of two legions, with the proper contingent of Italian allies and its auxiliary troops, was as follows (see plan): The <figure id="fig.00291">
<head orig="Plan of a Roman Camp. (After Polybius.)">Plan of a Roman Camp. (After Polybius.)</head>
</figure> camp was square, its front being on the side farthest from the enemy. It had two main streets through it. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <seg lang="la">via principalis</seg>, 100 feet wide, which divided it into a front part amounting to about two-thirds of the whole, and a back part turned towards the enemy. This road ended at two gates: the <seg lang="la">porta principalis dextra</seg> and the <seg lang="la">porta principalis sinistra. (b)</seg> The <seg lang="la">via praetoria</seg>, which cut the <seg lang="la">via principalis</seg> at right angles, and divided the whole length of the camp into two parts. This road was 50 feet in width, and ended in two gates: the <seg lang="la">porta decumana</seg> in front and the <seg lang="la">porta praetoria</seg> on the side opening towards the enemy. In the front part were encamped the two legions, with their allied contingents. They lay <cb /> in three double rows of tents on each side of the <seg lang="la">via praetoria</seg>, which made a right angle with the <seg lang="la">via principalis.</seg> Its whole length was divided by streets 50 feet in width, while across it, from one lateral rampart to the other, ran the <seg lang="la">via quintana.</seg> The front side of the rows of tents was turned towards the intervening streets. Starting from the <seg lang="la">via praetoria</seg>, the first two lines of tents on each side contained the cavalry and infantry of one legion each, while the third row, lying nearest to the rampart, contained the cavalry and infantry of the allied contingents. In the hinder part of the camp, directly upon the <seg lang="la">via principalis</seg>, and on both sides of the <seg lang="la">via praetoria</seg>, were the tents of the twelve military tribunes, opposite the four ranks of the legions. On both sides were the tents of the <seg lang="la">praefecti</seg> of the allied contingents, placed in the same way opposite those of the troops under their command. Then followed the headquarters, or <seg lang="la">praetorium</seg>, a space 200 feet square, intersected by the <seg lang="la">via praetoria.</seg> In this was the general's tent (<seg lang="la">tabernaculum</seg>); in front was the altar on which the general sacrificed, on the left the <seg lang="la">augurale</seg> for taking the auspices, and on the right the <seg lang="la">tribunal.</seg> This was a bank of earth covered with turf, on which the general took his stand when addressing the troops (see <ref type="cross" target="crossadlocutio">Adlocutio</ref>) or administering justice. On the right of the <seg lang="la">praetorium</seg> was the <seg lang="la">quaestorium</seg>, containing the quarters of the paymasters and the train of artillery. On the left was the <seg lang="la">forum</seg>, a meeting-place for the soldiers. Between these spaces and the lateral ramparts were the tents of the select troops who composed the body-guard of the general. Those of the cavalry had their front turned inwards, while those of the infantry were turned towards the wall. The tents of the picked allied troops occupied the hinder part of the camp, which was bounded by a cross-road 100 feet in breadth. The tents of the cavalry looked inwards, those of the infantry towards the rampart. The auxiliary troops were posted at the two angles of this space. The rampart was divided from the tents by an open space 200 feet in width. This was specially intended to facilitate the march of the troops at their entrance and exit.</p>
 <p>The construction of the fortifications always began before the general's tent was pitched. The legionaries constructed the rampart and ditch in front and rear, while the allies did the same on either side. The stakes required for the formation of an <hi rend="italic">abattis</hi> on the outer side of the wall were carried by the soldiers themselves on the march. The whole work was carried on under arms. The watches (<seg lang="la">excubiae</seg> and <seg lang="la">vigiliae</seg>) were kept with great strictness both by day and night. The <seg lang="la">vigiliae</seg>, or night-watches, were relieved four 
<pb n="292" /><cb />
 times, the trumpet sounding on each occasion. The posts of each night-watch were inspected by four Roman <seg lang="la">equites.</seg> The password for the night was given by the general. Each gate was guarded by outposts of infantry and cavalry, the lightarmed troops (<seg lang="la">velites</seg>) being also distributed as sentries along the ramparts. When the camp was to break up, three signals were given; at the first, the tents were taken down and packed up; at the second, they were put upon beasts of burden and in wagons; and at the third, the army began its march.</p>
 <p>After the time of Polybius the Roman military system underwent many changes, which involved alterations in the arrangements of the camp, but we have no trustworthy information on this subject in detail until the beginning of the second century A.D. The treatise of <ref type="cross" target="crosshyginus">Hyginus</ref> (q.v.) on castrametation gives the following statements as to the practice of his time. The ordinary form of a camp was that of a rectangle, the length of which was about a third part greater than the breadth. In former times the legions were posted inside the camp; but now, being regarded as the most trustworthy troops, they were encamped along the whole line of ramparts, the width of which was now limited to 60 feet. They were separated from the interior of the camp by a road 30 feet wide (<seg lang="la">via sagularis</seg>), running parallel to the line of ramparts. The interior was now divided, not into two, but into three main sections. The midmost of these lay between the <seg lang="la">via principalis</seg>, which was 60, and the <seg lang="la">via quintana</seg>, which was 40 feet wide. It was occupied by the <seg lang="la">praetorium</seg> and the troops of the guard, and was called the wing of the <seg lang="la">praetorium (latera praetorii)</seg>. The auxiliary troops were stationed in what was now the front part, or <seg lang="la">praetentura</seg>, between the <seg lang="la">via principalis</seg> and the <seg lang="la">porta praetoria</seg>, and the rear, or <seg lang="la">retentura</seg>, between the <seg lang="la">via quintana</seg> and the <seg lang="la">porta decumana.</seg> The <seg lang="la">via praetoria</seg>, which was also 60 feet wide, led only from the <seg lang="la">praetorium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">forum</seg> in front of it to the <seg lang="la">porta praetoria</seg>, as at this time the <seg lang="la">quaestorium</seg> was situated between the <seg lang="la">porta decumana</seg> and the <seg lang="la">praetorium.</seg> The general superintendence of the arrangements was, during the imperial period, in the hands of the <seg lang="la">praefectus castrorum.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosspraefectus-castrorum">Praefectus Castrorum</ref>.</p>

 <p> (the name, not older than the third century A.D., is formed from <foreign lang="greek">κατὰ</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">κύμβη</foreign>, “a hollow place”). A name given to subterranean burialplaces, of which the most famous exist in Egypt, Rome, Naples, Syracuse, and Malta. The so-called Catacombs of Paris, as places of interment, are modern, dating from the close of the last century only.</p>
 <p>The Catacombs of Egypt are vast in extent and extremely numerous, running through the range of mountains in the vicinity of Thebes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossthebae">Thebae</ref>.) Among them are especially to be noted the caverns in which the bodies of the Theban kings were originally interred. These were forty-seven in number, and, like the more elaborate of the other tombs, were covered with hieroglyphics and ornamented with pictures, mostly in fresco. The oldest of them now existing are not less than 4000 years of age, and have long since been plundered for the sake of the ornaments and other valuables contained in them. A most interesting collection of these frescoes can be found in the drawings and coloured plates of Wilkinson's <bibl default="NO"><title>Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians</title> (London, 1847)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The Roman Catacombs were originally quarries, of which some are of very great antiquity, antedating the traditional date of the founding of the city. These were subsequently extended so that at last all the seven hills of Rome were pierced by them. They are low dark corridors or vaulted halls excavated in the soft volcanic tufa and <hi rend="italic">puzzolana</hi>, in the lateral walls of which apertures were made for the reception of corpses. In all there are some forty Catacombs, each forming a network of galleries, usually intersecting one another at right 
<pb n="293" /><cb />
 angles, but occasionally radiating from a common centre. The passages are of an average height of eight feet and of an average width of from three to five feet. The apertures (<seg lang="la">loculi</seg>) used as graves run in tiers at the sides, and were covered in by marble slabs or tiles bearing either religious emblems or mortuary inscriptions. The whole length of the Roman Catacombs is from 500 to 550 miles, and they are estimated to have contained fully 6,000,000 bodies.</p>
 <p>It must be remembered that while the Greeks and Romans finally adopted cremation as a means for disposing of their dead (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfunus">Funus</ref>), the Egyptians and Jews, and latterly the Christians, regarded interment as more in accordance with their views on the subject of a future life. Hence the Roman Christians used and greatly extended the subterranean excavations now called Catacombs, and only afterwards employed them for purposes of concealment during the various per<figure id="fig.00293">
<head orig="Ground Plan of Roman Catacombs.">Ground Plan of Roman Catacombs.</head>
</figure> secutions that harassed the Church at intervals from the time of Nero to that of Diocletian (A.D. 303). A popular error makes the Catacombs to have been originally the secret, anxiously concealed places of refuge of the primitive Christians; but they were rather, as Professor Springer says, “their legally recognized, publicly accessible places of burial. Reared in the midst of the customs of heathen Rome, the Christian community perceived no reason to depart from the artistic principles of antiquity. In the embellishment of the Catacombs they adhered to the decorative forms handed down by their ancestors; and in design, choice of colour, grouping of figures, and treatment of subject, they were entirely guided by the customary rules.”</p>
 <p>The monotonous passages of the Catacombs are occasionally broken by the introduction of larger chambers used as <seg lang="la">cubicula</seg> or family burial-places. There are also chambers set apart for worship, but these are not earlier than the fourth century. The Christian excavations were made by a regular society of <seg lang="la">fossores.</seg> In most cases, the bodies to be interred were wrapped in cloth, and after the consecrated bread had been placed upon the breast, various other ornaments and memorials were added. <cb /> Earthen lamps were frequently set by the slabs which closed the niches.</p>
 <p>The decoration of the Catacombs is interesting as throwing light upon the development of early Christian art. Many of the paintings are frescoes of the first and second century, and in their subjects are chiefly symbolical of the hopes of Christianity, the Resurrection being a favourite theme. The Good Shepherd, the Miracles, Daniel in the den of lions, and the Hebrews in the fiery furnace, also occur with frequency. The fish, too, by a kind of acrostic, is likewise an important symbol, on which see <ref type="cross" target="crossacrosticha">Acrosticha</ref>. A great number of inscriptions, many of them of much interest, occur. There are no representations of scenes of martyrdom earlier than the fifth century.</p>
 <p>The most important of the Catacombs and the only one that has been even yet quite thoroughly explored is that of St. Callistus on the Via Appia. The one farthest distant (six miles) is that of St. Alexander.</p>
 <p>Interments in the Catacombs were discontinued in the fifth century, but the caverns were still visited as containing the tombs of the martyrs. As early as A.D. 370, Pope Damasus caused apertures for lighting to be made, and had the most important tombs furnished with inscriptions. In the year 537, during the siege of Rome by the Goths, the tombs were pillaged, and again by the Lombards in 755, for the sake of the ornaments of gold and silver contained in them. From the time of Pope Paschalis I. (817- 824), the Catacombs gradually fell into oblivion, until under Pope Paul III. <bibl default="NO">(in 1535)</bibl> investigation of them was once more begun. The enthusiastic and learned priest, Father Bosio, spent thirty years in exploring the passages, and in making drawings of the most interesting objects, such as lamps, vases, and monuments, contained in them. His great work, <title>Roma Sotterranea</title>, was published (in Italian) in 1632, three years after his death, edited by Father Severani. It was translated into Latin by Father Aringhi, and is still the most important source of information on the subject. In 1720, appeared Boldetti's valuable folio, which was followed by the noble contribution of Seroux d'Agincourt, <title>Histoire de l'Art par les Monuments</title>, one of the most learned of all the works relating to the Catacombs. Other valuable books for the student are those of Perret, <title>Les Catacombes</title>

<div2 id="crosscatana" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Catăna">Catana</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κατάνη</foreign>). A city of Sicily, on the eastern coast, at the base of Aetna, and a short distance below the river Acis and the Cyclopum Scopuli. It was founded by a colony from Chalcis in Euboea, in B.C. 730, five years after the settlement of Syracuse. Catana, like all the other colonies of Grecian origin, soon became independent of any foreign control, and, in consequence of the fertility of the surrounding country, attained to a considerable degree of prosperity. It does not appear, however, to have been at any time a populous city; and hence Hiero of Syracuse was enabled without difficulty to transfer the inhabitants to Leontini. A new colony of Peloponnesians and Syracusans was established here by him, and the place called Aetna, from its proximity to the mountain.</p>
 <p>After the death of Hiero, the new colonists were driven out by the Siculi, and the old inhabitants from Leontini then came, and, recovering possession of the place, changed its name again to Catana. We find Catana after this possessed for a short time by the Athenians, and subsequently falling into the hands of Dionysius of Syracuse. This tyrant, according to Diodorus Siculus (xiv. 15), sold the inhabitants as slaves, and gave the city to his mercenary troops, the Campani, to dwell in. It is probable, however, that he only sold those who were taken with arms in their hands, and that many of the old population remained, since Dionysius afterwards persuaded these same Campani to migrate to the city of Aetna. Catana fell into the power of the Romans during the First Punic War. The modern name is Catania, and the distance from it to the summit of Aetna is given as thirty miles.

 <p>According to Vegetius, it was an additional defence, suspended by iron rings and ropes before the gates of a city, in such a manner that when the enemy had come up to the gates the portcullis might be let down so as to shut them in, and to enable the besieged to assail them from above.

The gates were placed at A A, turning on pivots (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscardo">Cardo</ref>), as is proved by the holes in the pavement, which still remain. This end of the road was nearest to the town; in the opposite direction, the road led into the country. The portcullis was at B B, and was made to slide in grooves cut in the walls. The sideways, secured with smaller gates, were roofed in, whereas the portion of the main road between the gates (A A) and the portcullis (B B) was open to the sky. When, therefore, an attack was made, the assailants were either excluded by the portcullis, or, if they forced their way into the barbican, and attempted to break down the gates, the citizens, surrounding and attacking them from above, had the greatest possible facilities for impeding and destroying them. Vegetius speaks of the <seg lang="la">cataracta</seg> as an <hi rend="italic">ancient</hi> contrivance; and it appears to have been employed by the Jews at Jerusalem as early as the time of David.

 <p> dim. <ref type="cross" target="crosscatella">Catella</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλυσις</foreign>, dim. <foreign lang="greek">ἀλύσιον, ἀλυσίδιον</foreign>). A chain.</p>
 <p>Thucydides informs us that the Plataeans made use of “long iron chains” to suspend the beams which they let fall upon the battering-rams of their assailants. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaries">Aries</ref>.) Under the Romans, prisoners were chained in the following manner: The soldier who was appointed to guard a particular captive had the chain fastened to the wrist of his left hand, the right remaining at liberty. The prisoner, on the contrary, had the chain fastened to the wrist of his right hand. Hence <seg lang="la">dextras insertare catenis</seg> means to submit to captivity: <seg lang="la">leviorem in sinistra catenam.</seg> The prisoner and the soldier who had the care of him (<seg lang="la">custos</seg>) were said to be <hi rend="italic">tied</hi> to one another. Sometimes, for greater security, the prisoner was chained to two soldiers, one on each side of him. If he was found guiltless, they broke or cut asunder his chains. Instead of the common materials, iron or bronze, Antony, having got into his power Artavasdes, king of the Armenians, paid him the pretended compliment of having him bound with chains of gold ( Paterc. <bibl n="Vell.  2. 82" default="NO" valid="yes">Vell.ii. 82</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Chains which were of superior value, either on account of the material or the workmanship, are commonly called <seg lang="la">catellae</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλύσια</foreign>), the diminutive 
<pb n="296" /><cb />
 expressing their fineness and delicacy as well as their minuteness. The specimens of ancient chains which we have in bronze lamps, in scales (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslibra">Libra</ref>), and in ornaments for the person, especially necklaces (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmonile">Monilé</ref>), show a great variety of elegant and ingenious patterns. Besides a plain circle or oval, the separate link is often shaped <figure id="fig.00296">
<head orig="Catenae—Chain-links. (British Museum.)">Catenae—Chain-links. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> like the figure 8, or is a bar with a circle at each end, or assumes other forms, some of which are here shown. The links are also found so closely entwined that the chain resembles plaited wire or thread, like the gold chains now manufactured at Venice. This is represented in the lower figure of the illustration.</p>
 <p>These valuable chains were sometimes given as rewards to the soldiers; but they were commonly worn by ladies, either on the neck or around the waist; and were used to suspend pearls, or jewels set in gold, keys, lockets, and other trinkets.

<div2 id="crosscatilina" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Catilīna</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Lucius Sergius</foreName>
 <p>A Roman of patrician rank, and the last of the gens Sergia. Of his father and grandfather little is known: the former would seem to have been in indigent circumstances, from the language of Quintus Cicero (<title>De Petitione Consulatus</title>, 2), who speaks of Catiline as having been born amidst the poverty of his father (<seg lang="la">in patris egestate</seg>). The great-grandfather, M. Sergius Silus or Silo, distinguished himself greatly in the Second Punic War, and was present at the battles of Ticinus, Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cannae. Pliny speaks of his exploits in a very animated strain.</p>
 <p>The cruelty of Catiline's disposition, his undaunted resolution, and the depravity of his morals fitted him for acting a distinguished part in the turbulent and bloody scenes of the period in which he lived. He embraced the interest of Sulla , in whose army he held the office of quaestor. Many citizens of noble birth are said by Quintus Cicero to have fallen by his hand; and, according to Plutarch, he had assassinated his own brother during the Civil War; and now, to screen himself from prosecution, persuaded Sulla to put him down among the proscribed as a person still alive. He murdered too, with his own hands, his sister's husband, a Roman knight of peaceable character. One of the worst actions, however, of which he was guilty would seem to have been the killing of M. Marius Gratidianus, a near relative of the celebrated Marius. Sulla had put the name of this individual on the list of the proscribed, whereupon Catiline entered the dwelling of the unfortunate 
<pb n="297" /><cb />
 man, exhausted upon his person all the refinements of cruelty and insult, and, having at last put an end to his existence, carried his bloody head in triumph through the streets of Rome, and brought it to Sulla as he sat on his tribunal in the Forum. When this was done, the murderer washed his hands in the lustral water at the door of Apollo's temple, which stood in the immediate vicinity ( <title>De Ira</title>, iii. 18).</p>
 <p>Catiline was peculiarly dangerous and formidable, as his power of dissimulation enabled him to throw a veil over his vices. Equally well qualified to deceive the good, to intimidate the weak, and to inspire with his own boldness his depraved associates, he evaded two accusations brought against him by Clodius for criminal intercourse with a Vestal, and for monstrous extortions of which he had been guilty while proconsul in Africa (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 687). He was charged also with having murdered his first wife and his son. A numerous group having been formed of young men of high birth and daring character, who saw no other means of extricating themselves from their enormous debts than by obtaining the highest offices of the State, Catiline was placed at their head. This eminence he owed chiefly to his connection with the old soldiers of Sulla , by means of whom he kept in awe the towns near Rome, and even Rome itself. At the same time, he numbered among his adherents not only the worst and lowest of the riotous populace, but also many of the patricians and men of consular rank. Everything favoured his audacious scheme. Pompey was pursuing the victories which Lucullus had prepared for him; and the latter was but a feeble supporter of the nobles in the Senate, who wished him, but in vain, to put himself at their head. Crassus, who had delivered Italy from the gladiators, was now striving with great eagerness after power and riches, and, instead of opposing, countenanced the growing influence of Catiline, as a means of his own aggrandizement. Caesar, who was labouring to revive the party of Marius, spared Catiline, and, perhaps, even encouraged him. Only two Romans remained determined to uphold their falling country: Cato and Cicero—the latter of whom alone possessed the qualifications necessary for the task. The conspirators were now planning the elevation of Catiline and one of his accomplices to the consulship. When this was effected, they hoped to obtain possession of the public treasures and the property of the citizens, under various pretexts, and especially by means of proscription. It is not probable, however, that Catiline had promised them the liberty of burning and plundering Rome. Cicero had the courage to stand as candidate for the consulship, in spite of the impending danger, of the extent of which he was perfectly aware. Neither insults nor threats, nor even riots and attempts to assassinate him, deterred him from his purpose; and, being supported by the richest citizens, he gained his election, B.C. 65. All that the party of Catiline could accomplish was the election of Gaius Antonius, one of their accomplices, as colleague of Cicero. This failure, however, did not deprive Catiline of the hope of gaining the consulship the following year. For this purpose he redoubled the measures of terror by means of which he had laid the foundation of his power. Meanwhile he had lost some of the most important members of his conspiracy. Antony <cb /> had been prevailed upon, or compelled by Cicero, to remain neutral. Caesar and Crassus had resolved to do the same. Piso had been killed in Spain. Italy, however, was destitute of troops. The veterans of Sulla only waited the signal to take up arms. This signal was now given by Catiline. The centurion Manlius appeared among them, and formed a camp in Etruria. Cicero was on the watch, and a fortunate accident disclosed to him the counsels of the conspirators. One of them, Curius, was on intimate terms with a woman of doubtful reputation, Fulvia by name, and had acquainted her with their plans. Through this woman, Cicero learned that two knights had undertaken to assassinate him at his house. On the day which they had fixed for the execution of their plan they found his doors barred and guarded. Still Cicero delayed to make public the circumstances of a conspiracy the progress and resources of which he wished first to ascertain. He contented himself with warning his fellow-citizens, in general terms, of the impending danger. But when the insurrection of Manlius was made known, he procured the passage of the celebrated decree, “that the consuls should take care that the Republic received no detriment.” By a decree of this kind, the consuls, or other magistrates named therein, were, in accordance with the custom of the State, armed with the supreme civil and military authority. It was exceedingly difficult to seize the person of one who had soldiers at his command, both in and out of Rome; still more difficult would it be to prove his guilt before those who were his accomplices with him, or, at least, were willing to make use of his plans to serve their own interests. Cicero had to choose between two evils—a revolution within the city, or a civil war; and he preferred the latter. Catiline had the boldness to take his seat in the Senate, known as he was to be the enemy of the Roman State. Cicero then rose and delivered that bold oration against him which was the means of saving Rome by driving Catiline from the city. The conspirators who remained—Lentulus, Cethegus, and other infamous senators—engaged to head the insurrection in Rome as soon as Catiline appeared at the gates. According to Cicero and Sallust, it was the intention of the conspirators to set the city on fire, and massacre the inhabitants. At any rate, these consequences might have easily followed from the circumstances of the case, without any previous resolution. Lentulus, Cethegus, and the other conspirators, in the meanwhile, were carrying on their criminal plots. They applied to the ambassadors of the Allobroges to transfer the war to the frontiers of Italy itself. These, however, revealed the plot, and their disclosures led to others still more important. The correspondence of the conspirators with their leader was intercepted. The Senate had now a notorious crime to punish. As the circumstances of the case did not allow a minute observance of form in the proceedings against the conspirators, the laws relating thereto were disregarded, as had been done in former instances of less pressing danger. Caesar spoke against immediate execution, but Cicero and Cato prevailed. Five of the conspirators were put to death. Gaius Antonius was then appointed to march against Catiline, but, on the even of battle, under pretence of being disabled by the gout, he gave the command to his lieutenant Petreius. The battle was fought at Pistoria in 
<pb n="298" /><cb /> Etruria, and ended in the complete overthrow of the insurgents. Catiline, on finding that all was lost, resolved to die sword in hand, and his followers imitated his example (B.C. 62).</p>
 <p>The history of Catiline's conspiracy has been written by Sallust in the extremely able monograph known as the <title>Bellum Catilinae.</title> See also the lives of Caesar and Cicero by Plutarch; Mommsen, <title>History of Rome</title>, iv. 203-209, 212-223; and the four orations of Cicero known as the <title>Orationes Catilinariae</title>, much read in schools. The story forms the subject of a tedious English play by Ben Jonson, entitled <title>Catiline's Conspiracy</title>, produced in 1611; and of a now-forgotten drama by Stephen Gosson. It is the basis of the historical novel by Herbert, <title>The Roman Traitor.</title>

<head orig="Cato">Cato</head>

 <p> A surname of the Porcian family, derived from the Sabine <seg lang="la">catus</seg>, cognate with <seg lang="la">acutus.</seg> (1) M. <ref type="cross" target="crossporcius-cato">Porcius Cato</ref>, surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Censorius</hi>, in allusion to the severity with which he discharged the office of a censor, and hence commonly styled, at the present day, “ Cato the Censor.” Other surnames <cb /> were, <ref type="cross" target="crosspriscus">Priscus</ref>, “the old,” and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Maior</hi>, “the elder,” both alluding to his having preceded, in order of time, the younger Cato , who committed suicide at Utica. Cato the Censor was born in B.C. 234 at Tusculum, of plebeian parents. His family were in very moderate circumstances, and little, if anything, was known of it, until he himself made the name a conspicuons one. His father left him a small farm in the Sabine territory, and here the first years of his youth were spent. The state of public affairs, however, soon compelled him to take up arms for the defence of his country. The Second Punic War had broken out, and Hannibal had invaded Italy. Cato, therefore, served his first campaign, at the age of seventeen, under Fabius Maximus, when he besieged the city of Capua. Five years after this he fought under the same commander at the siege of Tarentum, and, after the capture of this place, became acquainted with the Pythagorean Nearchus, who initiated him into the principles of that system of philosophy, with which, in practice, he had already become familiar. The war being ended, Cato returned to his farm. Near this there stood a cottage belonging to Manius Curius Dentatus, who had repeatedly triumphed over the Sabines and Samnites, and had at length driven Pyrrhus from Italy. Cato was accustomed frequently to walk over to the humble abode of this renowned commander, where he was struck with admiration at the frugality of its owner, and the skilful management of the farm which was attached to it. Hence it became his great object to emulate his illustrious neighbour, and adopt him as his model. Having made an estimate of his house, lands, slaves, and expenses, he applied himself to husbandry with new ardour, and retrenched all superfluity. In the morning he went to the small towns in the vicinity to plead and defend the causes of those who applied to him for assistance. Thence he returned to his fields, where, with a plain cloak over his shoulders in winter, and almost naked in summer, he laboured with his servants till they had concluded their tasks, after which he sat down along with them at table, eating the same bread and drinking the same wine. Valerius Flaccus, a noble and powerful Roman, who occupied an estate in the neighbourhood of Cato 's residence, persuaded the young Cato to remove to Rome, and promised to assist him by his influence and patronage. Cato came, accordingly, to the capital, with an obscure name, and with no other resources than his own talents and the aid of the generous Flaccus; but by the purity of his morals, the austere energy of his character, his knowledge of the laws, his fluency of elocution, and the great ability that marked his early forensic career, he soon won for himself a distinguished name. It was in the camp, however, rather than at the bar, that he strove to raise himself to eminence. At the age of thirty he went as military tribune to Sicily. The next year he was chosen quaestor, and was attached to the army which Scipio Africanus was to carry into Africa, at which period there commenced between him and that commander a rivalry and hatred which lasted until death. Cato , who had returned to Rome, accused Scipio of extravagance; and though he failed in supporting his charge, yet his zeal for the public good gained him great influence over the minds of the people. Five years subsequent to this, after having been already aedile, he was chosen praetor, 
<pb n="299" /><cb />
 and the province of Sardinia fell to him by lot. His integrity and justice, while discharging this office, brought him into direct and most favourable contrast with those who had preceded him. Here, too, it was that he became acquainted with the poet Ennius, who was then serving among the Calabrian levies attached to the army. From Ennius he acquired the Greek language, and, on his departure from the island, he took the bard along with him to Rome. He was finally elected consul, B.C. 193, and his colleague in office was Valerius Flaccus, his early friend. While consul he strenuously but fruitlessly opposed the abolition of the famous Oppian Law (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssumptuariae-leges">Oppia Lex</ref>), and soon after this set out for Spain, which had attempted to shake off the Roman yoke. With newly raised troops, which he soon converted into an excellent army, he quickly reduced that province to submission, and obtained the honours of a triumph at Rome. Hardly had Cato descended from the triumphal chariot, when, laying aside the consular robe and assuming the garb of the lieutenant, he accompanied, as such, the Roman commander Sempronius into Thrace. He afterwards placed himself under the orders of Manius Acilius, the consul, to fight against Antiochus, and carry the war into Thessaly. By a bold march he seized upon Callidromus, one of the rockiest summits of Thermopylae, and thus decided the issue of the conflict. For this signal service, the consul, in the excess of his enthusiasm, embraced him in the presence of the whole army, and exclaimed that it was neither in his power, nor in that of the Roman people, to award him a recompense commensurate with his deserts (B.C. 191).</p>
 <p>Seven years later he obtained the office of censor, notwithstanding the powerful opposition of a large part of the nobility, who dreaded to have so severe an inspector of public morals at a time when luxury, the result of their Asiatic conquests, had driven out many of the earlier virtues of the Roman people. He fulfilled this trust with inflexible rigour. Some of his acts, it is true, would seem to have proceeded from that pugnacious bitterness which must be contracted by a man engaged in constant strife and inflictions: thus, for example, he took away his horse from Lucius Scipio, and expelled Manilius from the Senate for kissing his wife in the presence of his children. Still, however, most of his proceedings when censor indicate a man who aimed, by every method, at keeping up the true spirit of earlier days. Hence, though his measures, while holding this office, caused him some obloquy and opposition, they met in the end with the highest applause; and when he resigned the censorship the people erected a statue to him in the Temple of Health, with an honourable inscription testifying his faithful discharge of the duties of his office. Cato 's attachment to the old Roman morals was still more plainly seen in his opposition to <ref type="cross" target="crosscarneades">Carneades</ref> (q.v.) and his colleagues, when he persuaded the Senate to send back these philosophers, without delay, to their own schools, through fear lest the Roman youth should lose their martial character in the pursuit of Grecian learning. The whole political career of Cato was one continued warfare. He was constantly accusing others, or made the subject of accusation himself. Livy , although full of admiration for his character, still does not seek to deny that Cato was suspected of having excited <cb /> the accusation brought against Scipio Africanus, which compelled that illustrious man to leave the capital. He was also the means of the condemnation of Scipio Asiaticus, who would have been dragged to prison had not Tiberius Gracchus generously interfered. As for Cato himself, he was fifty times accused and as often acquitted. He was eighty-five years of age when he saw himself compelled to answer the last accusation brought against him, and the exordium of his speech on that occasion was marked by a peculiar and touching simplicity: “It is a hard thing, Romans, to give an account of one's conduct before the men of an age different from that in which one has himself lived.”</p>
 <p>The last act of Cato 's public life was his embassy to Carthage, to settle the dispute between the Carthaginians and King Masinissa. This voyage of his is rendered famous in history, since to it has been attributed the destruction of Carthage. In fact, struck by the rapid recovery of this city from the loss it had sustained, Cato ever after ended every speech of his with the well-known words, <title>Praeterea censeo Carthaginem esse delendam</title> (“I am also of opinion that Carthage ought to be destroyed”). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscarthago">Carthago</ref>.</p>
 <p> Cato died a year after his return from this embassy, in the eighty-fifth year of his age. Although frugal of the public revenues, he does not appear to have been indifferent to riches, nor to have neglected the ordinary means of acquiring them; and, if Plutarch speaks truly, some of the modes to which he had recourse for increasing his resources were anything but reputable. Towards the end of his life he was fond of indulging in a glass of wine, and of inviting daily some of his neighbours to sup with him at his villa; and the conversation on these occasions turned, not as one might have supposed, chiefly on rural affairs, but on the praises of great and excellent men among the Romans. He was twice married, and had a son by each of his wives. His conduct as husband and father was equally exemplary. In fact, Cato may be taken as a specimen of the SabinoSamnite character, narrow, bigoted, and obstinate, yet inspired with a strong sense of duty and unimpeachable integrity.</p>
 <p>Among the literary labours of Cato , the first that deserves mention is the treatise <title>De Re Rustica</title>, more properly styled <title>De Agri Cultura</title>, which appears to have come down to us in a mutilated state, since Pliny and other writers allude to subjects as treated of by Cato , and to opinions as delivered by him in this book, which are nowhere to be found in any part of the work now extant. In its present state, it is merely the loose, disconnected journal of a plain farmer, expressed with rude, sometimes with almost oracular, brevity; and it wants all those elegant topics of embellishment and illustration which the subject might have so naturally suggested. It consists solely of the dryest rules of agriculture, and some recipes for making various kinds of cakes and wine. Servius says it is addressed to the author's son, but there is no dedication now extant. It is divided into chapters, but the author, apparently, had never taken the trouble of reducing his precepts to any sort of method, or of following any general plan. The hundred and sixty-two chapters, of which this work consists, seem so many rules committed to writing, as the daily labours 
<pb n="300" /><cb />
 of the field suggested. He gives directions about the vineyard, then goes to his corn-fields, and returns again to the vineyard. His treatise, therefore, was evidently not intended as a regular and well-composed book, but merely as a journal of incidental observations. That this was its utmost pretension is further evinced by the brevity of the precepts, and the deficiency of all illustrations or embellishment. Of the style, he of course would be little careful, as his memoranda were intended for the use only of his family and his slaves. It is therefore always simple, and sometimes rude, but it is not ill-adapted to the subject, and suits our notions of the severe manners of its author and the character of the ancient Romans.</p>
 <p>Besides this book on agriculture, Cato left behind him various works, which have almost entirely perished. He left a hundred and fifty orations ( <title>Brutus</title>, 17), which were extant in the time of Cicero, though almost entirely neglected, and a book on military discipline (Veget. i. 8). Both Cicero and Livy have expressed themselves very fully on the subject of Cato 's orations. The former admits that his “language is antiquated, and some of his phrases harsh and inelegant. But only change that,” he continues, “which it was not in his power to change—add number and cadence— give an easier turn to his sentences, and regulate the structure and connection of his words, and you will find no one who can claim preference over Cato.” Livy principally speaks of the facility, asperity, and freedom of his style.</p>
 <p>Of the book on military discipline, a good deal has been incorporated into the work of Vegetius; and Cicero's orations may console us for the want of those of Cato. But the loss of the seven books <title>De Originibus</title>, which he commenced in his vigorous old age, and finished just before his death, must ever be deeply deplored by the historian and the antiquary. Cato is said to have begun an inquiry into the history, antiquities, and language of the Roman people, with a view to counteract the influence of the Greek taste introduced by the Scipios. The first book of the valuable work <title>De Originibus</title>, as we are informed by Cornelius Nepos, in his short life of Cato , contained the exploits of the kings of Rome. Cato was the first author who attempted to fix the era of the foundation of Rome, which he calculated in his <title>Origines</title>, and determined to have been in the first year of the 7th Olympiad, which is also the estimate followed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The second and third books treated of the origin of the different states of Italy, whence the whole work has received the name of <title>Origines.</title> The fourth and fifth books comprehended the history of the First and Second Punic Wars; and in the two remaining books the author discussed the other wars of the Romans till the time of Servius Galba, who overthrew the Lusitanians. The whole work exhibited great industry and learning, and, had it descended to us, would unquestionably have thrown much light upon the early periods of Roman history and the antiquities of the different states of Italy. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, himself a sedulous inquirer into antiquities, bears ample testimony to the research and accuracy of that part which treats of the origin of the ancient Italian cities. Cato was the first of his countrymen who wrote on the subject of medicine. This was done in a work entitled <title>Commentarius quo Medetur Filio, Servis, Familiaribus.</title> <cb /> In this book of domestic medicine, duck, pigeons, and hare were the food he chiefly recommended to the sick. His remedies were principally extracted from herbs; and colewort or cabbage was his favourite cure ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 20.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xx. 9</bibl>). The recipes, indeed, contained in his work on agriculture show that his medical knowledge did not exceed that which usually exists among a semi-barbarous race, and only extended to the most ordinary simples which nature affords. Aulus Gellius (vi. 10) mentions Cato 's <title>Libri Quaestionum Epistolicarum</title>, and Cicero his <title>Apophthegmata</title> (<title>De Officiis</title>, i. 29)—the first example, probably, of that class of works which, under the appellation of <title>Ana</title>, were once so fashionable and prevalent in France.</p>

 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, son of Cato the Censor by his first wife. He distinguished himself greatly in the battle of Pydna, against Perses, king of Macedonia, and received high eulogiums from Aemilius Paulus, the Roman commander on that occasion, whose daughter Tertia he afterwards married. He died while filling the office of praetor ( <title>Cat. Mai.</title> 20, 24).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Salonius</hi>, or, as Plutarch calls him, <ref type="cross" target="crosssaloninus">Salonīnus</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Σαλωνῖνος</foreign>), son of Cato the Censor by his second wife. This second wife was the daughter of one Salonius, who had been Cato 's secretary, and was, at the time of the marriage, a member of his retinue. Salonius, like his half-brother Marcus, died when praetor. He left, however, a son named Marcus, who attained to the consulship, and who was the father of Cato the younger, commonly called Uticensis ( <title>Cat. Mai.</title> 27).</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossvalerius">Valerius</ref>, a celebrated grammarian and poet in the time of Sulla. He was deprived of all his patrimony during the excesses of the Civil War, and then directed his attention to literary pursuits. To him has been ascribed the poem of 186 hexameters, entitled <title>Dirae in Battarum</title>, an imprecation against the person who had caused the loss of his estate, and a lament for his love, Lydia.

 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, called also <ref type="cross" target="crossminor">Minor</ref>, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Uticensis</hi>, from his death at Utica, was great-grandson to the censor of the same name, and was born B.C. 93. A short time after his birth he lost both his parents, and was brought up in the house of Livius Drusus, his uncle on the mother's side. Even in early life Cato displayed a maturity of judgment and an inflexible firmness of character far above his years; and Sarpedon, his instructor, being accustomed to take him frequently to the residence of Sulla , who had been his father's friend, the young Cato , then but fourteen years of age, struck with horror at the bloody scenes that were passing around him, asked his preceptor 
<pb n="301" /><cb /> for a sword, that he might slay the tyrant. His affectionate disposition was clearly displayed in his strong attachment to Caepio, his brother by the mother's side, as may be seen by a reference to the pages of Plutarch. Being appointed to the priesthood of Apollo, he changed his residence, and took his share of his father's estate; but, though the fortune which he thus received was a considerable one, his manner of living was simpler and more frugal than ever. He formed a connection with Antipater of Tyre, the Stoic philosopher, made himself well acquainted with the tenets of that school, and ever after remained true to its principles, pushing them even to austerity. His first appearance in public was against the tribunes of the people, who wished to remove a column of the Porcian Basilica which incommoded their benches. This basilica had been erected by his great-grandfather, the censor, and the young Cato displayed on the occasion that powerful and commanding eloquence which afterwards rendered him so formidable to all his <figure id="fig.00301">
<head orig="Porcia and Uticensis. Cato (Vatican.)">Porcia and Uticensis. Cato (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> opponents. His first campaign was in the war against <ref type="cross" target="crossspartacus">Spartacus</ref> (q.v.), as a simple volunteer, his half-brother Caepio being a military tribune in the same army; and he distinguished himself so highly that Gellius, the praetor, wished to award him a prize of honour, which Cato , however, declined. He was then sent as military tribune to Macedonia. There he learned that Caepio was lying dangerously ill at Aenus in Thrace, and instantly embarked for that place in a small passage-boat, notwithstanding the roughness of the sea and the great peril which attended the attempt, but only arrived at Aenus just after Caepio had breathed his last. Stoicism was here of no avail, and the young Roman bitterly lamented the companion of his early years. According to Plutarch, there were some who condemned him for acting in a way so contradictory to his philosophical principles; but a more unfeeling charge was the one brought against him by Caesar, in his attack entitled <title>Anticatones</title> (q. v.). It was there stated that, after all the lavish expenditure in which Cato had indulged in performing the funeral obsequies of Caepio, and after having declined repayment from the daughter of the latter, he nevertheless passed Caepio's ashes through a sieve in search of the gold which might have melted down with them.</p>
 <p>When the term of his service in Macedonia had expired, he travelled into Asia, and brought <cb /> back with him the Stoic Athenodorus to Rome. He was next made quaestor, and discharged with so much impartiality the duties of this difficult office, and displayed so much integrity in its various details that, on the last day of his quaestorship, he was escorted to his house by the whole assembly of the people. So high, indeed, was the opinion entertained by his countrymen of the purity of his moral character that when, at the Floralia given by the aedile Messius, Cato happened to be a spectator, the people, out of respect for him, hesitated about ordering the prostitutes to strip themselves naked, according to long-established custom, nor would they allow this to be done until he had departed from the theatre (Val. Max. ii. 10, 8). When the conspiracy of Catiline was discovered, Cato supported by every means in his power the acts of Cicero, and was the first that gave him publicly the honourable title of Pater Patriae. Opposing after this the ambitious movements of the first triumvirate, they managed to have him removed to a distance, by sending him out as governor of the island of Cyprus. Having executed this trust with ability and success, and having deposited in the treasury nearly seven thousand talents of silver, he again took part in public affairs at Rome, and again continued his opposition to the triumvirate. When, however, the rupture took place between Pompey and Caesar, he sided with the former, and was left behind by him at Dyrrhachium to guard the military chest and magazine, while he pushed on after Caesar, who had been forced to retire from the siege of that city. Cato , therefore, was not present at the battle of Pharsalia. On receiving the news of this event, he sailed to Corcyra with the troops under his orders, and offered the command to Cicero, who declined it. He then proceeded to Africa, where he hoped to meet with Pompey; but on reaching Cyrené he heard of his death, and was also informed that Pompey's father-in-law, Scipio, had gone to Iuba, king of Mauritania, where Varus had collected a considerable force. Cato immediately resolved to join them, and, in order to effect this, was compelled to make a long and painful march across a desert region, in which his troops suffered severely from hunger, thirst, and every hardship, but which privations his own example enabled them manfully to endure. After seven days of suffering his force reached Utica, where a junction between the two armies took place. The soldiers wished to have him for their general, but he yielded to what he conceived to be the superior claims of Scipio, who held the office of proconsul; and this fault on his part, of which he soon after had reason to repent, accelerated the ruin of the cause in which he had embarked. Scipio having wished, for Iuba's gratification, to put all the inhabitants of Utica to the sword, Cato strenuously opposed this cruel plan, and accepted the command of this important city, while Scipio and Labienus marched against Caesar. Cato had advised them to protract the war; but they hazarded an engagement at Thapsus, in which they were entirely defeated, and Africa submitted to the victor. After vainly endeavouring to prevail upon the fragments of the conquered army, as they came successively to Utica, to unite in defending that city against the conqueror, Cato furnished them with all the ships in 
<pb n="302" /><cb />
 the harbour to convey them wherever they wished to go. When the evening of that day came, he retired to his own apartments, and employed himself for some time in reading the  <title>Phaedo</title>of Plato, a dialogue that turns upon the immortality of the soul. He endeavoured at the same time to lull the suspicions of his friends by seeming to take a lively interest in the fate of those who were escaping by sea from Utica, and by sending several times to the seaside to learn the state of the wind and weather. But towards morning, when all was quiet, he stabbed himself. He fell from his bed with the blow, and the noise of his fall brought his son and servants into the room, by whose assistance he was raised from the ground, and an attempt was made to bind up the wound. Their efforts to save him were in vain, for Cato had no sooner recovered his self-possession than he tore open the would again in so effectual a manner that he instantly expired. He died at the age of forty-eiglit. When Caesar heard of his fate, he is said to have exclaimed, “I grudge thee thy death, Cato , since thou hast grudged me the saving of thy life.” Such was the end of a man whom a better philosophy, by teaching him to struggle with his predominant faults instead of encouraging them, would have rendered truly amiable and admirable. He possessed the greatest integrity and firmuess; and, from the beginning of his political career, was never swayed by fear or interest to desert that which he considered the cause of liberty and justice. During the Civil War he had the rare merit of uniting to the sincerest ardour in the cause of his party a steady regard for justice and humanity; he would not countenance cruelty or rapine because practised by his associates or coloured with a pretence of public advantages. But philosophical pride overshadowed the last scenes of his life, and led him to indulge his selfish feelings by suicide, rather than live for the happiness of his family and friends, and mitigate, as far as lay in his power, the distressed condition of his country. His character, however, was so pure, and, since Pompey's death, so superior to that of all the leaders engaged with him in the same cause, that his opponents could not refuse him their respect.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Porcius</hi>, son of the preceding, was spared by Caesar, but led a somewhat immoral life, until he effaced the stains upon his character by a glorious death at Philippi ( <title>Cat. Min.</title> 73).</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dionysius </hi>Cato . A name erroneously given to the author of a collection of moral maxims in four books, much used as a school-book in the Middle Ages, and translated into English before 1479 by Benedict Burgh, whose version was printed by Caxton. Each maxim consists of two hexameters, the whole number of maxims being 164. The style is fairly good, and shows the poem to date from about the third century A.D. The collection is preceded by fifty-six short proverbs in prose with a separate preface, by a different author, probably of later date. The hexameters are generally spoken of as <title>Disticha Catonis</title> (<title>Catonis Disticha de Moribus ad Filium</title>), and in a Paris MS. as <title>Liber Catonis Philosophi</title>, but the name Cato is probably used merely to designate the maxims as shrewd and wise. The addition of the name Dionysius is doubtless due to a confusion arising from the fact that one of the earlier MSS. of the <title>Disticha</title> contained also a translation of the <title>Periegesis</title> of Dionysius. A good text is that of Hauthal <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1869)</bibl>.<cb />

<div2 id="crosscatullus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Catullus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Valerius</foreName>
 <p>A celebrated Roman poet, born in the territory of Verona, about B.C. 84. His praenomen, Gaius , is not given in any good MSS., which only mention his cognomen; but Gaius is accepted on the authority of Apuleius ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>10</bibl>). In consequence of an invitation from Manlius Torquatus, one of the noblest patricians of the State, he proceeded in early youth to Rome, where he appears to have kept but indifferent company, at least in point of moral character. He impaired his fortune so much by his extravagance that he complains he had no one <lb />Fractum qui veteris pedem grabati, <lb />In collo sibi collocare possit.</p>
 <p>This, however, must have been written partly in jest, as his finances were always sufficient to allow him to keep up a delightful villa on the peninsula of Sirmio and an expensive residence at Tibur. With a view of improving his pecuniary circumstances, he adopted the usual Roman mode of reestablishing a diminished fortune, and accompanied MemmiusGaius , the celebrated friend of Lucretius, to Bithynia, where he was appointed praetor to that province. His situation, however, was but little ameliorated by this expedition, and, in the course of it, he lost a beloved brother who was along with him, and whose death he lamented in verse never surpassed in delicacy or pathos. He came back to Rome with a shattered constitution and a lacerated heart. From the period of his return to Italy to his decease, his time appears to have been chiefly occupied with the prosecution of amours in the capital or in the solitudes of Sirmio. He died B.C. 54.</p>
 <p>The distracted and unhappy state of his country, and his disgust at the treatment which he had received from Memmius, were perhaps sufficient excuse for shunning political employments; but, when we consider his taste and genius, we cannot help regretting that he was merely an idler and a debauchee. He loved Clodia (supposed to have been the sister of the tribune Clodius), a beautiful but shameless woman, whom he has celebrated under the name of Lesbia. Among his friends he ranked not only most men of pleasure and fashion in Rome, but many of her eminent literary and political characters, such as Cornelius Nepos, Cicero, and Asinius Pollio. His enemies seem to have been as numerous as his loves or friendships, and competitions in poetry or rivalship in gallantry appear always to have been a sufficient cause for his dislike; and where an antipathy was once conceived, he was unable to put any restraint on the expression of his hostile feelings. His poems are chiefly employed in the indulgence and commemoration of these various passions. They have been 
<pb n="303" /><cb />
 divided into lyric, elegiac, and epigrammatic, an arrangement convenient from its generality, but to which all can not, with strictness, be reduced. He seems to have been the earliest lyric poet of Latium, notwithstanding the claim of Horace to the same honour. Much of his poetry appears to have been lost: the pieces that remain to us (116 in all) exhibit, in singular contrast, the sensual grossness which is imbibed from depraved habits and loose imaginations, together with exquisite touches of sentiment and taste, and the polish of intellectual cultivation. Those who turn with disgust from the coarse impurities that sully his pages may be inclined to wonder that praises of his delicacy should ever have been coupled with the name of Catullus. But to many of his effusions, distinguished both by fancy and feeling, this praise is justly due. Many of his amatory trifles are quite unrivalled in the elegance of their playfulness; and no author has excelled him in the purity and neatness of his style, the delightful ease and simplicity of his manner, and in graceful turns of thought and felicity of diction. Some of his pieces, which breathe the higher enthusiasm of the art, and are coloured with a singular picturesqueness of imagery, increase our regret at the manifest mutilation of his works. Among these, the most remarkable is, perhaps, the <title>Attis</title>, a poem in the galliambic metre, and unlike the work of any other Latin author in the strangeness of its subject and its weird imaginative power. No one of his poetical predecessors was more versed in Greek literature than Catullus, and his extensive knowledge of its beauties procured for him the appellation of <title>Doctus.</title></p>
 <p>Catullus translated many of the shorter and more delicate pieces of the Greeks, an attempt which hitherto had been thought impossible, though the broad humour of their comedies, the vehement pathos of their tragedies, and the romantic interest of the <title>Odyssey</title>, had stood the transformation. His stay in Bithynia, though little advantageous to his fortune, rendered him better acquainted than he might otherwise have been with the productions of Greece; and he was therefore, in a great degree, indebted to this expedition for those felicitous turns of expression, that grace, simplicity, and purity which are the characteristics of his poems, and of which hitherto Greece alone had afforded models. Indeed, in all his verses, whether elegiac or heroic, we perceive his imitation of the Greeks; and it must be admitted that he has drawn from them his choicest stores. His Hellenisms are frequent; his images, similes, metaphors, and addresses to himself are all Greek; and even in the versification of his odes we see visible traces of their origin. Nevertheless, he was the inventor of a new species of Latin poetry; and as he was the first who used such variety of measures, and perhaps invented some that were new, he was amply entitled to call the poetical volume which he presented to Cornelius Nepos <seg lang="la">lepidus novus libellus.</seg> The expressions, too, and idioms of the Greek language, which he has so carefully selected, are woven with such art into the texture of his composition, and so aptly paint the impassioned ideas of his muse, that they have all the fresh and untarnished hues of originality.</p>
 <p>All the MSS. of Catullus are of recent date, and all are derived from a single codex (Codex Veronensis) of which Rather, bishop of Verona (A.D. 965) <cb /> made some use, and which in the fourteenth century was again copied, as also a third time, and then finally lost. The earliest and best MS., copied directly from the Codex Veronensis, is one in Paris (Germanensis), nearly related to which is the Codex Oxoniensis, probably copied about the year 1400 (Bährens). In all, there are some seventy MSS. of Catullus, on which see R. Ellis's prolegomena.</p>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek Inns</hi>.—In the earliest ages of Greece, as in the East at all times and in newly settled colonies, there was no provision for the entertainment of travellers, and the duty of hospitality was universally acknowledged. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshospitium">Hospitium</ref>.) The growth of traffic rendered inns necessary, and in later times they appear to have been very numerous. The great number of festivals which were celebrated in the different towns of Greece, besides the four great national games, to which persons flocked from all parts of the Hellenic world, must have required a considerable number of inns to accommodate strangers, not only in the places where the festivals were celebrated, but also on the roads leading to those places.</p>
 <p>The accommodation provided was, however, far from luxurious, and the character both of the houses and of their landlords was very indifferent. Inns were regarded as little better than brothels: <foreign lang="greek">πανδοκεῦσαι καὶ πορνοβοσκῆσαι</foreign> are joined together (Theophr. <bibl n="Thphr. Char. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Char.</title>6</bibl>); <foreign lang="greek">καπηλεῖα κἁὶ πορνεῖα</foreign> ( <bibl n="Poll.  9. 34" default="NO">Poll.ix. 34</bibl>). The orgies of Demetrius Poliorcetes in the Acropolis suggest to a comic poet that “he took it for an inn”: <lb /><foreign lang="greek">ὁ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν πανδοκει_ον ὑπολαβὼν</foreign> <lb /><foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὰς ἑταίρας εἰσαγαγὼν τη_ παρθένῳ</foreign></p>
 <p>( <hi rend="italic">Philippid. fr.</hi> 25 M. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi>  <bibl n="Plut. Demetr. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Demetr.</title>26</bibl>). Moreover, besides the charges of fraud and adulteration to which they were liable in common with other <foreign lang="greek">κάπηλοι</foreign> or retail dealers, the hosts were often accused of more serious crimes. Two stories told by Cicero, but taken from Greek life, both turn on <cb /> murders committed by innkeepers for the sake of gain (<title>De Inv.</title> ii. 4. 14; <title>De Div.</title> i. 27. 57). The higher classes used these <foreign lang="greek">πανδοκεῖα</foreign> as little as possible; yet, in default of other accommodation, the public ambassadors of Athens were sometimes constrained to lodge and even to transact diplomatic business in them ( <title>De F. L.</title> 97; <title>De F. L.</title> p. 390. 158=175).</p>
 <p>The word <foreign lang="greek">καπηλεῖον</foreign> signified, as has been already remarked, a place where wine and ready-dressed provisions were sold. <foreign lang="greek">Κάπηλος</foreign> signifies, in general, a retail trader who sold goods in small quantities. The term, however, is more particularly applied to a person who sold ready-dressed provisions, and especially wine on draught (Schol. <title>Plut.</title> p. 1156;  Plat. <title>Gorg.</title>p. 518 B). When a retail dealer in other commodities is spoken of, the name of his trade is usually prefixed. These <foreign lang="greek">καπηλεῖα</foreign> were not resorted to as clubs (<foreign lang="greek">λέσχαι, ἑταιρεῖαι</foreign>), or for purposes of good-fellowship, but merely for sottish drinking; and hence were extremely disreputable. Isocrates tells us that in the “good old times” (i. e. the democracy of Solon and Cleisthenes) no respectable slave would have ventured to eat or drink in a <foreign lang="greek">καπηλεῖον</foreign>: whereas in his own time young men of the greatest respectability, driven by an absurd prejudice from the schools of philosophy and rhetoric, spent their whole time in these and similar establishments, in drinking, gambling, and debauchery (Isocr. <title>Areop.</title> 49; <title>Antid.</title> 287). We are therefore not surprised to read of the low estimation in which innkeepers were held.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman Inns</hi>.—A Roman wayside inn for the reception of travellers was called not only <seg lang="la">caupona</seg>, but also <seg lang="la">taberna, deversorium</seg>, and <seg lang="la">taberna deversoria</seg> (the last in Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Men. 2. 3.81" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Men.</title>ii. 3. 81</bibl>; Varr. <title>R. R.</title> i. 2, 23). Along all the great roads of Italy there were inns, as we see from the description which Horace gives of his journey from Rome to Brundusium ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl>). They were built as a speculation by neighbouring proprietors, and either let to a landlord or managed by slaves. They usually included a <seg lang="la">stabulum</seg> for horses and mules; hence, in the Digest, <seg lang="la">caupones</seg> and <seg lang="la">stabularii</seg> are more than once mentioned together. Where the traffic was greatest, there might be several in the same place. To take the Appian Way alone, we find the station Tres Tabernae ( <title>Ad Att.</title> ii. 12, 13), Forum Appii <seg lang="la">differtum cauponibus</seg> ( Hor. l. c. 4), Tabernae Caediciae near Sinuessa (  <title>Epit.</title>p. 45 M), <title>Caudi cauponas</title> ( Hor. l. c. 51). From Plautus downward, these hostelries occur repeatedly in Latin literature. Ambassadors were usually received at the public expense in decent lodgings; but the Rhodian embassy of B.C. 167 was driven to a <seg lang="la">sordidum deversorium</seg> ( Liv. xlv. 22). Cicero mentions a <title>copo de via Latina</title> suborned as a false witness (<title>Pro Cluent.</title> 59. 163), and the discreditable tippling of Antonius in a <seg lang="la">cauponula</seg> a few miles from Rome on the Via Flaminia ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2. 31. 77" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phil.</title>ii. 31. 77</bibl>). Cynthia drove past a <seg lang="la">taberna</seg> on her way to Lanuvium, and the remarks of the tavern-brawlers disgusted her poet-lover (Propert. v. 8, 19). The sprightly Vergilian <title>Copa</title> (q. v.) shows us, in a very modern fashion, the competition between rival establishments and the advertiser's art in full operation. The accommodation at these places was generally of a poor kind, but extremely cheap. In Polybius's time in Cisalpine Gaul there were no items in the bill; the inclusive charge (inquired beforehand, it should be added) 
<pb n="305" /><cb />
 rarely exceeded half an <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (Polyb. ii. 15). For the early imperial period we have the record of the well-known relief at Aesernia, representing a hostess reckoning with a parting guest. The dialogue between the two is given at length, and the charges are: bread and a pint of wine, 1 <hi rend="italic">as;</hi> meat (<seg lang="la">pulmentarium</seg>), 2 <seg lang="la">asses;</seg> mule's provender, 2 <seg lang="la">asses;</seg> and another less decent item, for which we refer the curious to the inscription itself. (This relief is figured in the <title>Bullettino Napolitano</title>, vi. 1, and thence in Daremberg and Saglio; the inscription is in Mommsen, <title>Inscr. Regn. Neap.</title> 5078=OrelliHenzen, 7306).</p>
 <p>At Rome there must have been many inns to accommodate strangers, but they are hardly ever spoken of. We, however, find frequent mention of houses where wine and ready-dressed provisions were sold, and which appear to have been numerous in all parts of the city. The houses where people were allowed to eat and drink were called, almost indiscriminately, <seg lang="la">cauponae, popinae, thermopolia</seg>, and <seg lang="la">tabernae vinariae.</seg> The specialty of the <seg lang="la">thermopolia</seg> is noticed under <ref type="cross" target="crosscalda">Calda</ref>. These places were principally frequented by slaves and the lower classes, and are qualified by such epithets as <seg lang="la">nigra, fumosa, immunda, uncta</seg> (probably “greasy,” though it has also been taken in a good sense). Among other discomforts, they were only furnished with stools to sit upon, instead of couches. This circumstance is illustrated by a painting found at Pompeii in a wine-shop, representing a drinkingscene in which there are four persons sitting on stools <figure id="fig.00305">
<head orig="A Wine-shop. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)">A Wine-shop. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> around a tripod table. The dress of two of the figures is remarkable for the hoods, which resemble those of the capotes worn by Italian sailors and fishermen at the present day. They use cups made of horn instead of glasses, and from their whole appearance evidently belong to the lower orders. Above them are different sorts of eatables hung upon a row of pegs.</p>
 <p>From the moral point of view the Roman inns, whether lodging-houses or mere drink-shops, were no better than the Greek. Hence we find <seg lang="la">salax taberna, fornix</seg> joined with <seg lang="la">uncta popina</seg>, and the legal aspect in <title>Dig.</title> xxiii. 2, 43. 9. Nor are other records wanting. Behind the wine-shop at Pompeii, where the painting described above was found, is the celebrated brothel, the contents of which are now carefully preserved in the Naples Museum. The Aesernian inscription already mentioned tells the same tale. Wine or eating shops used for immoral purposes were called <seg lang="la">ganeae</seg>, and are often classed with the <seg lang="la">lustra.</seg> Naturally, therefore, persons who kept houses of public entertainment of any kind were held in low estimation. The common opinion as to their honesty is expressed <cb /> by the epithets <seg lang="la">perfidus</seg> and <seg lang="la">malignus</seg>, which Horace gives to them (I. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 29" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 29</bibl>; v. 4).</p>
 <p>Under the emperors many attempts were made to regulate the <seg lang="la">popinae</seg>, but apparently with little success. Tiberius forbade all cooked provisions to be sold in these shops ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>34</bibl>); and Claudius commanded them to be shut up altogether. They appear, however, to have been soon opened again, if they were ever closed; for Nero restricted them to the sale of cooked vegetables, and prohibited meat ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 16" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>16</bibl>); and an edict to the same effect was also published by Vespasian. See Zell, <title>Die Wirthshäuser der Alten</title>, in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Ferienschriften</title> (Freiburg, 1826)</bibl>; Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 27-45.

<head orig="Cautio, Cavēre">Cautio, Cavere</head>

 <p> These words are of frequent occurrence in the Roman writers and jurists, and have a great variety of siguifications, according to the matter to which they refer. Their general meaning is that of security given by one person to another, or security which one person obtains by the advice or assistance of another. The general term (<seg lang="la">cautio</seg>) is distributed into its species according to the particular kind of the security, which may be by <seg lang="la">satisdatio</seg>, by a <seg lang="la">fideiussio</seg>, and in various other ways. The general sense of the word <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> is accordingly modified by its adjuncts, as <seg lang="la">cautio fideiussoria, pigneraticia</seg>, or <seg lang="la">hypothecaria</seg>, and so on. <title>Cautio</title> is used to express both the security which a <seg lang="la">magistratus</seg> or a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> may require one party to give to another, which applies to cases where there is a matter in dispute of which a court has already cognizance; and also the security which is a matter of contract between parties not in litigation. The words <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> and <seg lang="la">cavere</seg> are more particularly used in the latter sense.</p>
 <p>If a thing is made a security from one person to another, the <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> becomes a matter of <hi rend="italic">pignus</hi> or of <seg lang="la">hypotheca;</seg> if the <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> is the engagement of a surety on behalf of a principal, it is a <seg lang="la">cautio fideiussoria.</seg></p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> was most frequently a writing, which expressed the object of the parties to it; accordingly, the word <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> came to signify both the instrument (<seg lang="la">chirographum</seg> or <seg lang="la">instrumentum</seg>) and the object which it was the purpose of the instrument to secure. The phrase <seg lang="la">cavere aliquid alicui</seg> expressed the fact of one person giving security to another as to some particular thing or act.

 <p><title>Cautiones</title> which were a branch of <seg lang="la">stipulationes</seg> were such contracts as would be ground of actions.</p>
 <p>In many cases a <seg lang="la">heres</seg> could not safely pay legacies, unless the legatee gave security (<seg lang="la">cautio</seg>) to refund in case the will under which he claimed should turn out to be bad. The <title>cautio Muciana</title> was the engagement by which the <seg lang="la">heres</seg> bound himself to fulfil the conditions of his testator's will, or to give up the inheritance. The <seg lang="la">heres</seg> was also, in some cases, bound to give security for the payment of legacies, or the legatee was entitled to the <title>bonorum possessio. Tutores</title> and <seg lang="la">curatores</seg> were required to give security (<hi rend="italic">satisdare</hi>) for the due administration of the property intrusted to them, unless the <seg lang="la">tutor</seg> was appointed by testament, or unless the <seg lang="la">curator</seg> was a <seg lang="la">curator legitimus.</seg> A <seg lang="la">procurator</seg> who sued in the name of an absent party might be required to give security that the absent party would consent to be concluded by the act of his <seg lang="la">procurator;</seg> this security was a species of <seg lang="la">satisdatio</seg>, included under the genus <seg lang="la">cautio.</seg> In the case of <seg lang="la">damnum infectum</seg>, the owner of the land or property threatened with the mischief might call for security on the person threatening the mischief.</p>
 <p>If a vendor sold a thing, it was usual for him to declare that he had a good title to it, and that if any person recovered it from the purchaser by a better title, he would make it good to the purchaser; and in some cases the <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> was for double the value of the thing. This was, in fact, a warranty.</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> was also applied to the release which a debtor obtained from his creditor on satisfying his demand; in this sense <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> is equivalent to a modern receipt; it is the debtor's security against the same demand being made a second time. Thus <seg lang="la">cavere ab aliquo</seg> signifies to obtain this kind of security. A person to whom the <seg lang="la">usus fructus</seg> of a thing was given might be required to give security that he would enjoy and use it properly, and not waste it.</p>
 <p><title>Cavere</title> is also applied to express the professional advice and assistance of a lawyer to his client for his conduct in any legal matter.</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">cavere</seg> and its derivatives are also used to express the provisions of a law by which anything is forbidden or ordered, as in the phrase <title>Cautum est lege</title>, etc. It is also used to express the words in a will by which a testator declares his wish that certain things should be done after his death. The preparation of the instruments of <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> was, of course, the business of a lawyer.</p>
 <p>It is unnecessary to particularize further the species of <seg lang="la">cautio</seg>, as they belong to their several heads in the law.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κέβης</foreign>). A Greek philosopher, and disciple of Socrates, and also one of the interlocutors whom Plato introduces in his dialogue entitled <title>Phaedo.</title> He was born at Thebes, and composed three dialogues, called <title>Hebdomé</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑβδόμη</foreign>), <title>Phrynichus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Φρύνιχος</foreign>), and <title>Pinax</title>, or the Picture (<foreign lang="greek">Πίναξ</foreign>). The last is the only one which has come down to us. It is commonly cited by its Latin title <title>Cebetis Tabula</title> (i. e. <seg lang="la">picta</seg>), and is a moral sketch or picture of human life, written in a pleasing and simple style. Some critics have raised doubts as to the authenticity of this little work. It contains, indeed, a very pure vein of morality, but is not composed, as they think, in the true spirit of the Socratic school; and they are inclined, therefore, to regard it as the work of some Stoic who wished to show that happiness consisted in the practice of virtue. But it is expressly attributed to Cebes by Lucian (<title>De Mercede Conduct.</title> 42), and after him by Tertullian (<title>De Praescript. adv. Haeret.</title> 39), Diogenes Laertius (ii. 125), Chalcidius, and Suidas. Wolff was the first among the moderns who ventured to call in question this testimony of the ancients. No work of antiquity has met with a wider circulation. In the Middle Ages it was extremely popular, and it has been translated into almost all the modern languages, including even the Arabic—this version, in fact (of the ninth century A.D.), being our only source for the close of the dialogue. The best editions of Cebes are that of Schweighäuser <bibl default="NO">(Strassburg, 1806)</bibl>; that of Thieme <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1810)</bibl>, with German notes of great merit; of Jerram <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1877)</bibl>; and of Parsons <bibl default="NO">(Boston, 1887)</bibl>.

In his reign Poseidon and Athené contended for the possession of Attica, but Cecrops decided in favour of the goddess. Cecrops is said to have founded Athens—the citadel of which was called Cecropia, after him—to have divided Attica into twelve communities, and to have introduced the first elements of civilized life. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>.) He instituted marriage, abolished bloody sacrifices, and taught his subjects how to

 <p> (1) In its primary sense, <seg lang="la">cella</seg> means a store-room, of which the following were the principal descriptions: <seg lang="la">cella penaria or penuaria</seg>, where all kinds of provisions (<seg lang="la">penus</seg>) were stored, especially those of which a stock was laid in for a long time; <seg lang="la">cella promptuaria, promptuarium</seg>, or <seg lang="la">promum</seg>, the larder, where meat and other things required <cb /> for immediate consumption were kept; <seg lang="la">cella olearia</seg>, the magazine of an olive-yard in which the oil was stored, and which, according to the treatises on farming, ought to be lighted from the south, that the oil might not be chilled in winter; while the <seg lang="la">cella vinaria</seg> should have a northern aspect, to avoid excessive heat and great changes of temperature. The <seg lang="la">cella vinaria</seg> described in the ancient authors is the store-room of a vineyard, in which the new wine was kept in <seg lang="la">dolia</seg> or <seg lang="la">cupae</seg>, while older wine was put into <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg> and matured in the <seg lang="la">apotheca.</seg> The <seg lang="la">cella vinaria</seg> was partly underground (Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 51, 422). The <seg lang="la">cella vinaria</seg> of a wine-merchant was discovered in 1789 under the walls of Rome. It was raised a little above the level of the ground, and divided into three compartments, the first ornamented with arabesques and a mosaic pavement, the second unpaved and containing a row of very large <seg lang="la">dolia</seg> two-thirds imbedded in sand, while the third was a narrow gallery, six feet high and eighteen feet long, with various earthenware vessels, also partially sunk in the sand and ranged in double rows against each wall. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdolium">Dolium</ref>.) The slave to whom the charge of these stores was intrusted was called <seg lang="la">cellarius, a rationibus cellae, promus, promus condus</seg>, or <seg lang="la">procurator peni;</seg> under him was the <seg lang="la">subpromus.</seg></p>

<head orig="Celsus">Celsus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aulus Cornelius</hi>. A celebrated physician. His native city is unknown; some writers contending for Rome, others for Verona. The time in which he lived has also been made a 
<pb n="308" /><cb />
 subject of controversy, but the most probable opinion is that he lived in the first half of the first century A.D., and wrote under Tiberius and Claudius. Celsus composed a large work, on the plan, in some measure, of an encyclopaedia, in which he treated of philosophy, jurisprudence, warfare, agriculture, and medicine. It was entitled <title>De Artibus.</title> Unhappily, however, only the eight books (from the sixth to the fourteenth) which treat of medicine have come down to us.</p>
 <p>Roman literature, otherwise so barren of good medical authorities, can boast of possessing in Celsus one who, for elegance, terseness, learning, good sense, and practical information, stands unrivalled. His preface contains an admirable exposition of the principles of the different schools which had risen up in medicine before his time; and in the remaining part of the first book there are many pertinent remarks on the best method of preserving the health. In the second, which treats of the general symptoms and phenomena of diseases in general, he has drawn freely from Hippocrates. The last part of this book is devoted to the subject of diet and regimen; and here his views will, with a few exceptions, be admitted by the unprejudiced to be wonderfully correct. In the third book he has treated of fevers; and here his distinctions, remarks upon critical days, and treatment will be found to be particularly deserving of attention. The other parts of his work it is unnecessary to go over minutely; but one may point out, as particularly valuable, his divisions and treatment of ulcers. It is remarkable that no ancient writer has treated of the diseases of the sexual organs with the same precision that he has done. The different shades of cutaneous diseases he has marked with a surprising degree of precision. But of the whole work the most interesting part, perhaps, is the seventh book, which treats of the operations of surgery according to the views of the Alexandrian School. His account of those performed upon the eye may be instanced as particularly excellent. The operation of lithotomy, as described by him, though not exactly the same as that now generally practised, has had, even in modern times, its admirers. Celsus has the merit of being the first author who makes mention of the application of the ligature to arteries for stopping hemorrhage. The best MSS. of Celsus are in the Vatican, the Laurentian Library, and in Paris—the oldest being of the tenth century. They all have a common origin. The best editions are those of Targa <bibl default="NO">(Padua, 1769, and Verona, 1810)</bibl>; Milligan <bibl default="NO">(Edinb. 1831)</bibl>; Ritter and Albers <bibl default="NO">(Cologne, 1835)</bibl>; Renzi <bibl default="NO">(Naples, 1851)</bibl>; and Daremberg <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1859)</bibl>. Milligan's edition has a good index, and that of Renzi a good lexicon. See Kissel, <bibl default="NO"><title>Celsus, eine hist.

 <p>(2) A Platonic, or perhaps Epicurean, philosopher who lived about A.D. 180. His name is famous as that of one of the bitterest enemies of Christianity. From a motive of curiosity, or, perhaps, in order to be better able to combat the new religion, Celsus caused himself to be initiated into the mysteries of Christianity, and to be received into that secret society which St. Clement of Rome is supposed to have founded. It appears, however, that the sincerity of the neophyte was distrusted, and that he <cb /> was refused admittance into the higher ceremonies. The discontent to which this gave rise in the breast of Celsus inflamed his resentment against the Christians, and he wrote a work against them, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἀληθὴς Λόγος</foreign>, “A true discourse,” in which he employed all the resources of his intellect and eloquence to paint Christianity as a ridiculous and contemptible system, and its followers as a sect dangerous to the well-being of the State. There is no falsehood to which he has not recourse in order to represent in an untrue light the Christian scheme of morals, to parody and falsify the text of the Old and New Testaments, and to calumniate the character of Jesus Christ and his disciples. He styles Christianity a doctrine tending to pervert and corrupt the human race, and exhorts the government to extirpate the sect if it wishes to save the Empire. The discourse itself is lost; but Origen, who refuted it, in a work divided into eight books, has given us so complete an extract from it that by the aid of this we can follow all the principal reasoning of the author. Celsus wrote also a work against magicians and sorcerers (<foreign lang="greek">Κατὰ Μάγων</foreign>), which is cited by Origen and Lucian. The latter, who was his friend, addressed to him his memoir on Alexander, the false prophet, in which he extols the wisdom of Celsus, his love for truth, and his amiable manners. See <bibl default="NO">Keim, <title>Celsus' wahres Wort</title> (1873)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO">Aubé, <title>La Polémique Païenne</title> (1878)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO">Pélagaud, <title>Étude sur Celse</title> (1878)</bibl>.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κελταί</foreign>). The ancients had no comprehensive name to denote generically the collective Keltic peoples. The Continental Kelts were called <title>Galli</title> or <title>Celtae</title> by the Romans, and <foreign lang="greek">Γαλάται</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Κελταί</foreign> by the Greeks, all these names being applied only to the Kelts of the Continent, with whom, in the popular view, the people of Britain had no ethnic relation. Caesar understood the racial identity of the Britanni with the Galli, Celtae, and Belgae, but the general usage of the words as stated above embodied the prevailing belief.</p>
 <p>According to Prof. Rhys, it would appear probable that the west of Europe had in early times experienced two Keltic invasions, since the two distinct names in Greek and Latin are not used as synonymous, but as denoting two different ethnic divisions. Thus in the ecclesiastical writer Sulpicius Severus (fourth century A.D.), <title>Celticé</title> is differentiated from <title>Gallicé</title> (Migne, <title>Patrolog.

 <p>The two waves of migration may roughly be represented geographically as follows: (1) the Kelts of Gaul, Spain, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and Scotland; and</p>
 <p>(2) the Kelts dwelling near the Rhine, the Alps, and in England and Wales. Schleicher, in the <title>Rheinisches Museum</title> for 1859, expounded his theory of a Kelto-Italic period, according to which the people who afterwards separated into Greeks, Italians, and Kelts are regarded as having left the early home of the race together, the Greeks branching off first into Hellas. Then followed the Italo-Keltic period, during which the Italo-Kelts developed those linguistic forms which the Keltic and the Latin alone possess in common—e. g. the future in -<seg lang="la">bo</seg>, the passive formation in -<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, the dative ending -<hi rend="italic">bus</hi>,

 <p>Historically, the Keltic and Latin races come into contact not earlier than the fifth century B.C., when the Gauls crossed the Alps and began first to press against the Etruscan communities in the north of Italy. Their leader, Bellovesus the Biturigan, directed the Insubrian migration into the valley of the Padus (Po), where the oldest Keltic settlement was established, to develop later into the important city of Mediolanum (Milan). A second invasion followed, and founded the towns of Brixia (Brescia) and Verona. Thenceforward, tribe after tribe poured into Italy, dislodging the Etruscans, and at last (B.C. 396) coming in contact with the Umbrians, and in 388 facing the Romans in successful battle. This was the year in which Brennus with 70,000 Gauls crossed the Tiber, won the bloody victory of the <ref type="cross" target="crossallia">Allia</ref> (q.v.) on July 18, and three days later marched through the open gates of Rome. (On the date, see Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, i. 428, Amer. ed. 1888.) They often returned to Latium, but were less successful in following years. The Romans, who had at first despised them, now strained every nerve to avenge the defeat of the Allia. <ref type="cross" target="crosscamillus">Camillus</ref> (q.v.) routed them at Alba (B.C. 367); Servilius Ahala repulsed them in front of the Porta Collina (B.C. 360); and the dictator Gaius Sulpicius Peticus won a decisive victory over them in 358. Yet in the year 350 they had again returned, and encamped for an entire winter on the Alban Mount, joining with the Greek pirates for plunder, till Lucius Furius Camillus, son of the great general, dislodged them. The increasing power of the Romans, and perhaps, as Mommsen suggests, changes beyond the Alps, put an end to the migrations from Gaul; and the Kelts began to settle down into a less predatory condition between the Alps and the Apennines as far south as the Abruzzi, the chief tribes being the Insubres, Boii, Lingones, and Senones, the territory of the last-named being on the coast of the Adriatic, from Ariminum to Ancona, the so-called Ager Gallicus. Here the Kelts, uniting with the Ligurians and Etrurians, gradually took on the character of a settled community, until at last they, with the rest of Italy, became subject to the all-embracing power of Rome.</p>
 <p>Of the Kelts who first swept over Italy and destroyed Rome, the historians give a picturesque account. Brave, open, impetuous, they were swayed by every passing impression; “they devoted themselves chiefly to two things—fighting and <hi rend="italic">esprit</hi>” (<seg lang="la">rem militarem et argute loqui</seg>, Cato , <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 2." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>ii.</bibl> frag. 2, ed. Jordan). Despising agriculture as disgraceful and unfit for freemen, they followed the profession of arms like soldiers of fortune. The Romans before the battle of the Allia had despised them as barbarians, and on the occasion of that memorable conflict had sent against them only an ill-organized and over-confident army. The legionaries were appalled when the onset of these fierce warriors smote the Roman phalanx. Stripped naked for battle, sword in hand, utterly heedless of death, the Keltic hosts of Brennus fell upon their enemies with an ardour and impetuosity that swept away an army in an instant. Yet, with all their bravery and brilliancy, the Kelts never made <cb /> any lasting political impression upon the countries that they overran. They lacked the political, constructive instinct which the Latins and the Germans, too, possessed. They destroyed, but did not create, and in a few centuries had everywhere succumbed to the steadier valour and more enduring power of the Romans.</p>

 <p> A powerful people in Spain, consisting of Kelts, who crossed the Pyrenees at an early period, and became mingled with the Iberians, the original inhabitants of the country. They dwelt chiefly in the central part of Spain. Their country, called Celtiberia, was mountainous and unproductive. They were a brave and warlike people, and proved formidable enemies to the Romans. They submitted to Scipio Africanus in the Second Punic War, but the oppression of the Roman governors led them to rebel, and for many years they successfully defied the power of Rome. They were reduced to submission on the capture of Numantia by Scipio Africanus the Younger (B.C. 134), but they again took up arms under Sertorius, and it was not till his death (B.C. 72) that they began to adopt the Roman customs and language.

 <p> less correctly <ref type="cross" target="crosscoena">Coena</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>). The principal meal of the Greeks and Romans, corresponding to our dinner rather than supper. As the meals are not always clearly distinguished, it will be convenient to give a brief account of all of them under the present head.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. The materials for an account of the Greek meals, during the classical period of Athens and Sparta, are almost confined to incidental allusions of Plato and the comic writers. Several ancient authors, termed <foreign lang="greek">δειπνολόγοι</foreign>, are mentioned by Athenaeus; but, unfortunately, their writings only survive in the fragments quoted by him. His great work, the <title>Deipnosophistae</title>, is an inexhaustible treasury of this kind of knowledge, though very ill-arranged. See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenaeus">Athenaeus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The poems of Homer contain a real picture of early manners, in every way worthy of the antiquarian's 
<pb n="310" /><cb /> attention. As they stand apart from all other writings, it will be convenient to exhibit in one view the state of things which they describe. It is not to be expected, however, that the Homeric meals should at all agree with the customs of a later period. Athenaeus (i. 8), who has entered fully into the subject, remarks on the simplicity of the Homeric banquets, in which kings and private men all partake of the same food. It was common enough for royal personages to prepare their own meals, and Odysseus ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 15. 322" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xv. 322</bibl>) declares himself no mean proficient in the culinary art.</p>
 <p>Three names of meals occur in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title>—<foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον, δεῖπνον, δόρπον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δόρπος</foreign>. The word <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> uniformly means the early as <foreign lang="greek">δόρπον</foreign> does the late meal; but <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>, though generally meaning the mid-day meal, is sometimes used where we should expect <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 15. 397" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xv. 397</bibl>) or even <foreign lang="greek">δόρπον</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 17. 170" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xvii. 170</bibl>). We should be careful, however, how we argue from the unsettled habits of a camp to the regular customs of ordinary life.</p>
 <p>In the Homeric Age it was usual to sit at table; and this custom, we are told, was kept up in historical times by the Cretans. Each guest had generally his own table, and an equal share of food was placed before each (hence <foreign lang="greek">δαὶς ἐΐση</foreign>), except when a specially distinguished guest was honoured by getting a larger portion ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7. 321" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>vii. 321</bibl>). What strikes us as peculiar in the Homeric dinners is their religious character. They partake more or less of the nature of a sacrifice, beginning with an offering of part of the meat to the gods, and both beginning and ending with a libation of wine; while the terms for slaughtering animals for a meal (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερεύειν, θύειν</foreign>) and for the slaughtered animals (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερήϊα</foreign>) are borrowed from the language of religious ceremony. The description of the dinner given by Eumaeus to Odysseus ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 14. 420" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xiv. 420</bibl>) gives a good picture of a dinner in the Homeric Age in humble society; and that given by Achilles to Odysseus ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 219" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ix. 219</bibl> foll.) may be taken as typical of the banquets of the great in the same period.</p>
 <p>Beef, mutton, swine's and goat's flesh were the ordinary meats, generally eaten roasted, though sometimes boiled ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 21. 363" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxi. 363</bibl>). Fish and fowls were almost unknown (Eustath. <seg lang="la">ad</seg>  <bibl n="Homer Od. 12. 330" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>xii. 330</bibl>). Many sorts of wine are mentioned, notably the Maronean and the Pramnian. Nestor had wine eleven years old ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 3. 391" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>iii. 391</bibl>). A small quantity was poured into each guest's cup to make a libation with (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσιν</foreign>), before the wine was regularly served out for drinking. The guests drank to each other ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 3. 40" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iii. 40</bibl>), and a second libation to the gods closed the repast ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 3. 332" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iii. 332</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The Greeks of a later age usually partook of three meals, called <foreign lang="greek">ἀκράτισμα, ἄριστον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>. The last, which corresponds to the <foreign lang="greek">δόρπον</foreign> of the Homeric poems, was the evening meal or dinner; the <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> was luncheon; and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀκράτισμα</foreign>, which answers to the <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> of Homer, was the early meal or breakfast.</p>
 <p>The <foreign lang="greek">ἀκράτισμα</foreign> was taken immediately after rising in the morning ( <bibl default="NO"><title>Aves</title>, 1286</bibl>). It usually consisted of bread dipped in unmixed wine (<foreign lang="greek">ἄκρατος</foreign>), whence it derived its name (Athen. i. 11).</p>
 <p>Next followed the <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign> or luncheon. The time at which it was taken is uncertain, though we may conclude from many circumstances that it was about the middle of the day, and that the meal answered to the Roman <seg lang="la">prandium.</seg> The market time, <cb /> at which provisions seem to have been bought for the <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign>, was from nine o'clock till noon. In Aristophanes ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 605" default="NO"> <title>Vesp.</title>605</bibl>-612) Philocleon describes the pleasure of returning home after attending the courts, and partaking of a good <foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign>. It was usually a simple meal, but of course varied according to the habits of individuals ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 11. 18" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>xi. 18</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The principal meal, however, was the <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>. It was usually taken rather late in the day, frequently not before sunset (Lysias, <title>de Caed. Eratosth.</title> 22).</p>
 <p>The Athenians were a social people, and were very fond of dining in company. Entertainments were usually given, both in the Heroic Age and later times, when sacrifices were offered to the gods, either on public or private occasions; and also on the anniversary of the birthdays of members of the family, or of illustrious persons, whether living or dead. Plutarch ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 8. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>viii. 1. 1</bibl>) speaks of an entertainment being given on the anniversary of the birthdays of both Socrates and Plato.</p>
 <p>Dining clubs were very common, the members of which contributed each a certain sum of money, called <foreign lang="greek">συμβολή</foreign>, or brought their own provisions with them. When the first plan was adopted, they were said <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ συμβολῶν δειπνεῖν</foreign>, and one individual was generally intrusted with the money to procure the provisions and make all the necessary preparations (Terence, <title>Eunuch.</title> iii. 4). When the second plan was adopted, they were said <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ σπυρίδος δειπνεῖν</foreign>, because the provisions were brought in baskets. This kind of entertainment is spoken of by Xenophon ( <bibl n="Aristot. Mem. 3. 14. 1" default="NO"> <title>Mem.</title>iii. 14. 1</bibl>). In Homer the word <foreign lang="greek">ἔρανος</foreign> corresponds with the later <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ συμβολῶν δεῖπνον</foreign>, while <foreign lang="greek">εἰλαπίνη</foreign> denotes a public entertainment on a festival or some such occasion (Athen. viii. 362 e).</p>
 <p>The most usual kind of entertainments, however, were those in which a person invited his friends to his own house. It was expected that they should come dressed with more than ordinary care, and also have bathed shortly before; hence, when Socrates was going to an entertainment at Agathon's, we are told that he both washed and put on his shoes—things which he seldom did (Plato, <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 174" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>174</bibl>A). As soon as the guests arrived at the house of their host, their shoes or sandals were taken off by the slaves, and their feet washed (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπολύειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀπονίζειν</foreign>). In ancient works of art we frequently see a slave or other person represented in the act of taking off the shoes of the guests, of which an example is given on the next page from a terra-cotta in the British Museum. After their feet had been washed, the guests reclined on the <foreign lang="greek">κλῖναι</foreign> or couches.</p>
 <p>Sitting at meals was, as has already been remarked, the practice of the Heroic Age, but in the classical period was confined to Crete. Women, however, when admitted to banquets on extraordinary occasions, such as a marriage (for they were generally excluded from table when guests were invited), took the sitting posture (Lucian, <bibl n="Matro Conv. 13" default="NO"> <title>Conv.</title>13</bibl>), and so did children ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 1. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>i. 8</bibl>). A very common representation on funeral monuments is the family meal, with the husband reclining, and the wife and children sitting at his side. Where women are represented as reclining at a meal, they are meant for <hi rend="italic">hetaerae.</hi></p>
 <p>It was usual for only two persons to recline on 
<pb n="311" /><cb />
 each couch. In ancient works of art we usually see the guests represented in this way, but sometimes there is a larger number on one long <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>. The guests reclined with their left arms on striped pillows (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπαγκώνια</foreign>), and having their right arms free. (Cf. Aristoph. <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 1210." default="NO"> <title>Vesp.</title>1210.</bibl>) <figure id="fig.00311">
<head orig="Slave taking off the Shoes of a Guest. (British Museum.)">Slave taking off the Shoes of a Guest. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>After the guests had placed themselves on the <foreign lang="greek">κλῖναι</foreign>, the slaves brought in water to wash their hands; and then the dinner was served up, the expression for which was <foreign lang="greek">τὰς τραπέζας εἰσφέρειν</foreign> ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 1216" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>1216</bibl>). By <foreign lang="greek">τὰς τραπέζας εἰσφέρειν</foreign> we are to understand not merely the dishes, but the tables themselves (Philoxen. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Athen. iv. 146 f). It appears that a table, with provisions upon it, was placed before each <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>: and thus we find in all ancient works of art which represent banquets or symposia, a small table or tripod placed before the <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>: and when there are more than two persons on the <foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>, several such tables. These tables were evidently small enough to be moved with ease.</p>
 <p>In eating, the Greeks had no knives or forks, but made use of their fingers only, except in eating soups or other liquids, which they partook of by means of a spoon (<foreign lang="greek">μύστρον</foreign>), or a piece of bread scooped out in the shape of a spoon (<foreign lang="greek">μυστίλη</foreign>) (Suidas, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">μυστίλη</foreign>). After eating, they wiped their fingers on pieces of bread, called <foreign lang="greek">ἀπομαγδαλιαί</foreign>, which were then thrown to the dogs ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 415" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eq.</title>415</bibl>). Napkins (<foreign lang="greek">χειρόμακτρα</foreign>) were not used till the Roman period.</p>
 <p>It appears that the arrangement of the dinner was intrusted to certain slaves. The one who had the chief management of it was called <foreign lang="greek">τραπεζοποιός</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τραπεζοκόμος</foreign> (Athen. iv. 170 e; Pollux, iii. 41; vi. 13). The Greek word for a <hi rend="italic">menu</hi> was <foreign lang="greek">γραμματίδιον</foreign> (Athen. ii. 49 d).</p>
 <p>It would exceed the limits of this work to give an account of the different dishes which were introduced at a Greek dinner, though their number is far below those which were usually partaken of at a Roman entertainment. The most common food among the Greeks was the <foreign lang="greek">μάζα</foreign>, a kind of soft cake, which was prepared in different ways, as appears by the various names which were given to it (Pollux, vi. 76). The <foreign lang="greek">φυστὴ μάζα</foreign>, of which Philocleon partakes on returning home from the courts ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 610" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>610</bibl>), is said by the Scholiast to have been made of barley and wine. The <foreign lang="greek">μάζα</foreign> continued to the latest times to be the common <cb /> food of the lower classes. Wheaten or barley bread was the second most usual species of food; it was sometimes made at home, but more usually bought at the market. The vegetables ordinarily eaten were mallows (<foreign lang="greek">μαλάχη</foreign>), lettuces (<foreign lang="greek">θρίδαξ</foreign>), cabbages (<foreign lang="greek">ῥάφανοι</foreign>), beans (<foreign lang="greek">κύαμοι</foreign>), lentils (<foreign lang="greek">φακαῖ</foreign>), etc. Pork was the favourite animal food, as was the case among the Romans. Sausages also were very commonly eaten. It is a curious fact, which Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 3. 13" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>iii. 13</bibl><bibl n="Plato Rep. 404" default="NO"> Rep., 404</bibl>) has remarked, that we never read in Homer of the heroes partaking of fish. In later times, however, fish was one of the favourite foods of the Greeks, insomuch so that the name of <foreign lang="greek">ὄψον</foreign> was applied to it <foreign lang="greek">κατ ἐξοχήν</foreign>. A minute account of the fishes which the Greeks were accustomed to eat is given at the end of the seventh book of Athenaeus, arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
 <p>The ordinary meal for the family was cooked by the mistress of the house, or by the female slaves under her direction; but for special occasions professional cooks (<foreign lang="greek">μάγειροι</foreign>) were hired, of whom there appear to have been a great number ( <bibl n="Diog.  2. 72" default="NO">Diog. Laert.ii. 72</bibl>). They are frequently mentioned in the fragments of the comic poets, and those who were acquainted with all the refinements of their art were in great demand in other parts of Greece besides their own country. The Sicilian cooks, however, had the greatest reputation, and a Sicilian book on cookery by one Mithaecus is mentioned in the <title>Gorgias</title> of Plato (p. 518 B); but the most celebrated work on the subject was the <foreign lang="greek">Γαστρολογία</foreign> of Archestratus (Athen. iii. 104 b).</p>
 <p>A dinner given by an opulent Athenian usually consisted of two courses, called respectively <foreign lang="greek">πρῶται τράπεζαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δεύτεραι τράπεζαι</foreign>. Pollux (vi. 83), indeed, speaks of three courses, which was the number at a Roman dinner; and in the same way we find other writers under the Roman Empire speaking of three courses at Greek dinners; but before the Roman conquest of Greece and the introduction of Roman customs, we read of only two courses. The first course embraced the whole of what we consider the dinner—namely, fish, poultry, meat, etc. (<foreign lang="greek">ἐδέσματα</foreign>); the second, which corresponded to our dessert and the Roman <seg lang="la">bellaria</seg>, consisted of different kinds of fruit, sweetmeats, confections, etc. (<foreign lang="greek">τρωγάλια</foreign>). The Roman first course of salads, vegetables, etc., was unknown to the Greeks in the time of their independence.</p>
 <p>When the first course was finished, the tables were taken away (<foreign lang="greek">αἴρειν, ἐκφέρειν, βαστάζειν τὰς τραπέζας</foreign>), and water was given to the guests for the purpose of washing their hands. Crowns made of garlands of flowers were also then given to them, as well as various kinds of perfumes. Wine was not drunk till the first course was finished; but as soon as the guests had washed their hands, unmixed wine was produced in a large goblet, called <foreign lang="greek">μετάνιπτρον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μετανιπτρίς</foreign>, of which each drank a little, after pouring out a small quantity as a libation. This libation was said to be made to the “good spirit” (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθοῦδαίμονος</foreign>), and was usually accompanied with the singing of the paean and the playing of flutes. After this libation mixed wine was brought in, and with their first cup the guests drank to <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς Σωτήρ</foreign> ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 2. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>ii. 1</bibl>). With the <foreign lang="greek">σπονδαί</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign> closed; and at the introduction of the dessert (<foreign lang="greek">δεύτεραι τράπεζαι</foreign>) the <foreign lang="greek">πότος, συμπόσιον</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">κῶμος</foreign> commenced, of which an account is given in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosssymposium">Symposium</ref>.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>. The Roman meals were <seg lang="la">ientaculum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκράτισμα</foreign>), <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign>), <seg lang="la">merenda</seg>, and <seg lang="la">cena</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign>).</p>
 <p><title>Ientaculum</title>, also called <hi rend="italic">silatum</hi> ( Fest. p. 346) because the wine used was sometimes perfumed with <seg lang="la">seselis</seg> or <seg lang="la">silis</seg>, was a slight morning meal taken at different times by early and late risers. Thus we find it taken by schoolboys at cock-crow ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 233" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 233</bibl>); but generally the Romans used to eat it about the third hour, certainly not later than the fourth ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 67</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 9</bibl>). The schoolboys had a kind of pancake (<seg lang="la">adipata</seg>); but usually the meal consisted of bread seasoned with salt or with honey, or dipped in wine, or of dates and olives. Alexander Severus used to have milk, eggs, and <seg lang="la">mulsum</seg> (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 30). Bread and cheese ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Ov. <title>Met.</title>i. 18</bibl>), and even meat, appear to have been sometimes taken ( <bibl n="Mart.  13. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiii. 31</bibl>); but to make the <seg lang="la">ientaculum</seg> a heavy meal was not in accordance with Roman manners.</p>
 <p>As with our own fathers noon was the time for the principal meal of the day—viz., dinner—so with the primitive Romans this was the time for <seg lang="la">cena</seg> ( <bibl n="Fest.  54" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest.54</bibl>; cf. p. 338, Müll.). It was only in later times that <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> became customary ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 20. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xx. 2</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 14</bibl>). We may fairly translate this word “luncheon.” When city life pushed the dinnerhour later and later, a mid-day meal became essential. It was taken about the sixth hour (<title>Anth. Pal.</title> x. 43, and scholiast), not so early as the fifth nor so late as the seventh. But if one took no <seg lang="la">ientaculum</seg>, he must needs take the <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> earlier, and this is the reason why we find Ausonius eating his <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> a little after the fourth hour (<title>Ephemeris</title> in <title>Corp. Poet. Lat.</title>, ed. Weber, p. 1217). <title>Prandium</title> seems to have been properly the name of the soldier's morning meal ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 20. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xx. 2</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 11</bibl>). For the ordinary citizen, the meal varied from a piece of bread eaten in the hand ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 83" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>83</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 6</bibl>) to an elaborate entertainment, with hot and cold fish, fowl, and meat, with vegetables and fruit. (Cf. Mayor on  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 3. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>iii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 11." default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 11.</bibl>) The meats were rather savoury dishes than solids—e. g. they were kernels of pork (<seg lang="la">glandulae, glandia</seg>, “sweetbreads”?). Often, as at our luncheons, the meat of the previous day's dinner was served cold or warmed up (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Pers. 1. 3. 25" default="NO"> <title>Pers.</title>i. 3. 25</bibl>). Wine ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 2</bibl>), hot wine and water ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 67</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 7</bibl>), and <seg lang="la">mulsum</seg> ( <title>Cluent.</title> 60, 166) were drunk at it. This latter passage refers to a large wedding breakfast which is called <seg lang="la">prandium.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Merenda</title> was in ancient times an afternoon meal, given to workmen, also called <seg lang="la">antecenium</seg> (Nonius, p. 59). If <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> was not taken at mid-day, <seg lang="la">merenda</seg> was a late <seg lang="la">prandium</seg> taken in the afternoon ( <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 5. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Calp. <title>Ecl.</title>v. 60</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The principal meal of the day was <seg lang="la">cena</seg>, “dinner.” The eighth hour in summer and the ninth in winter was sometimes the time for the bath ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 3. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>iii. 1</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 8</bibl>), and after that came dinner; but probably the bath was usually a little earlier. The ninth <cb /> was considered the normal dinner-hour ( <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Fam.</title>ix. 26</bibl>), though business must have often deferred it till after the tenth, and even later ( <bibl n="Mart.  3. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 36</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 5</bibl>). These were homely repasts; for the more fashionable banquets were, the earlier they began (Palmer on  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 3" default="NO"> Sat., 3</bibl>). Banquets which began earlier than the ninth hour were called <seg lang="la">tempestiva convivia</seg>, or <seg lang="la">de die cenare</seg> (<bibl n="Catul. 47.5" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 47, 5</bibl>). The <seg lang="la">cena</seg> always lasted for what would seem to us a very long time. Even Pliny the Elder, who was so miserly of his time, used to spend three hours at his dinner ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 3. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>iii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 13</bibl>), while old Cato used to remain conversing over this meal until late at night ( <bibl n="Cic. Sen. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Sen.</title>14</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Sen. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Sen., 46</bibl>). The business of the day was done, and the time for enjoyment had arrived; there was, accordingly, no necessity to break into the meal till bedtime, which was much earlier than with us, as the Romans got up at daybreak. Symposia, of course, lasted till midnight, and even morning. The ancient Romans, like the ancient Greeks, used to sit at dinner ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 20. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xx. 11</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 9</bibl>), and Columella (xi. 1, 19) thinks the <seg lang="la">vilicus</seg> should not recline except on holidays; and Cato the Younger, in sign of mourning, always sat at meals after the battle of Pharsalia ( <title>Cat. Min.</title> 56). <figure id="fig.00312">
<head orig="Symposium. (Millin.)">Symposium. (Millin.)</head>
</figure> However, in the times with which we are best acquainted, the Romans dined in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> ( Serv. on <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 730" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>i. 730</bibl>), in the circle of the family—the men reclining; the wife sitting on the <seg lang="la">lectus</seg> (Val. Max. ii. 1, 21); the children beside the couches ( <title>Claud.</title> 32), or on a lower couch ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>64</bibl>), and with a separate and more frugal table ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiii. 16</bibl>); the subordinate persons (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3. 1. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Capt.</title>iii. 1. 11</bibl>) and slaves on benches (<seg lang="la">subsellia</seg>). It was customary for the wife and children to dine with the men, except, apparently, in times of mourning ( <title>Calig.</title> 24), though, of course, there were gentlemen's dinner-parties ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>On the other hand, we find cases of women reclining where there was conceived to be nothing bold or indelicate in their posture. Thus, in the following illustration, taken from Montfaucon (<title>Ant. Exp. Suppl.</title> iii. 66), which seems intended to represent a scene of perfect matrimonial felicity, the husband and wife recline on a sofa of rich materials. A three-legged table is spread with viands before them, and their two sons are in front of the sofa, one of them sitting, in the manner above described, on a low stool, and playing with the dog. Several women and a boy are performing a piece of music for the entertainment of the married pair.

 <p>The very wealthy Romans built separate diningrooms, and to the article <ref type="cross" target="crosstriclinium">Triclinium</ref> and those on <ref type="cross" target="crosslectus">Lectus</ref> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pulvinus</hi> the reader is referred for the arrangement of the couches and of the guests at table. For the tables, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmensa">Mensa</ref>.</p>
 <p>During the later Republic and the Empire the number of guests at a private dinner-party was usually nine, and sometimes less ( <bibl n="Gel.  13.11.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii.11.2</bibl>), but to have more was considered unseemly ( <bibl n="Cic. Pis. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Pis.</title>27</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Pis. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Pis., 67</bibl>). Generally uninvited guests (<seg lang="la">umbrae</seg>) were brought by one of the invited guests to make up the nine (<title>Epist.</title> i. 5. 28); or perhaps a client was asked, in order not to leave a place empty ( <bibl n="Juv.  5. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.v. 17</bibl>). The guests used to dress for dinner—the dinner dress (<seg lang="la">vestis cenatoria</seg>) being generally a light, highly ornamented coloured tunic (<seg lang="la">prasina synthesis</seg>, <bibl n="Mart.  10. 29. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 29. 4</bibl>). It cannot be supposed that the changing of one's <seg lang="la">synthesis</seg> during dinner was other than vulgar ostentation ( <bibl n="Mart.  5. 79" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.v. 79</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 2</bibl>), but it was sometimes required by religious ceremonials. Dresssandals (<seg lang="la">soleae</seg>) were generally worn in the house of the host, but were taken off (<seg lang="la">demere soleas</seg>) before reclining for the meal. They were taken charge of by the guest's own slave whom he brought with him, for each guest had his own footman (<seg lang="la">servus a pedibus</seg>) to wait on him at table (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2. 4. 16" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Truc.</title>ii. 4. 16</bibl>; <bibl n="Petron.  58" default="NO">Petron.58</bibl> and 62). If the guest did not come in a litter, but walked, he often wore boots (<seg lang="la">calcei</seg>,  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 9. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ix. 47</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 3</bibl>). The regular expression for rising from table was <seg lang="la">soleas poscere</seg> ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8. 77" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8. 77</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The places were pointed out to the guests by the <seg lang="la">nomenclator</seg> (Athen. ii. 47 e); and when they had taken up their reclining position (<seg lang="la">accumbere, discumbere</seg>) at table, water was brought round and poured over the hands of each guest (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl.. Pers. 5. 1. 17" default="NO"> <title>Pers.</title>v. 1. 17</bibl>), and the hands wiped in a towel or napkin (<seg lang="la">mantela, mappa</seg>) provided by the host, though sometimes brought by the guest, in order to carry away the presents that the host frequently gave. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossapophoreta">Apophoreta</ref>.) Later <seg lang="la">mantele</seg> was used for a table-cloth ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 19. 26. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xix. 26. 6</bibl>). It was not till towards the end of the first century A.D. that table-cloths began to be used. Martial appears to be the first to allude to them (ix. 59, 7). Some times, apparently, grace was said (Quintil. <title>Declam.</title> 301, p. 583, ed. Burmann), and then the first of the three parts of the meal was proceeded with.</p>
 <p>This was called <seg lang="la">promulsis</seg> or <seg lang="la">gustatio, gustus;</seg> also <seg lang="la">frigida mensa.</seg> The cold dishes of this part of the meal used in early times to occupy a place at the conclusion ( <title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> viii. 9, 28). It consisted rarely of substantial meats, mostly of <hi rend="italic">hors d'oeuvres</hi> which whetted the appetite, and also served the purpose of the modern dinner-pill— e. g. shell-fish ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 4. 28" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 4. 28</bibl>), vegetables with <cb /> savoury sauces ( <bibl n="Mart.  3. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 50</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 4</bibl>), olives ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 46" default="NO"> Sat., 46</bibl>), mushrooms ( <bibl n="Juv.  5. 147" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.v. 147</bibl>), and also eggs; from which came the expression <seg lang="la">ab ovo ad mala</seg> ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 3</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 6" default="NO"> Sat., 6</bibl>), to signify from the beginning to the end of the meal. See further for the edibles which constituted the <seg lang="la">gustus</seg>, Apicius, 4, 5;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 15</bibl>; Macrob.  <title>Sat.</title>l. c.; Celsus, ii. 29; <bibl n="Mart.  10. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 48</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 7</bibl>-12; v. 78<bibl n="Mart.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 3</bibl>-5. The drink was <seg lang="la">mulsum</seg>, “mead”—a mixture of wine and honey; for plain wine was thought too strong ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 4" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 26" default="NO"> Sat., 26</bibl>). Hence the term <seg lang="la">promulsis</seg>—i. e. the <seg lang="la">mulsum</seg> taken before the chief portion of the meal.</p>
 <p>After this, followed the <seg lang="la">cena</seg> proper, which in early times, and even later in simple families, was the whole dinner ( <bibl n="Mart.  10. 48. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 48. 3</bibl>). It is from Lucullus that Athenaeus dates the beginning of extravagance in dining. When this part of the meal consisted of several courses (<seg lang="la">fercula, missus</seg>) —we hear of six, Augustus never had more ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>74</bibl>), and seven ( <bibl n="Juv.  1. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 94</bibl>), but the usual number was three ( <bibl n="Mart.  11. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xi. 31</bibl>) —the separate courses were called <seg lang="la">prima, altera, tertia cena</seg>, and appear to have followed in a regular order (Lucian, <title>De Merc. Cond.</title> 15). Each course was brought in on a tray (<seg lang="la">repositorium</seg>, <bibl n="Petron.  33" default="NO">Petron.33</bibl>), which was generally of wood, but sometimes of silver; and the arrangement of the viands on each dish and of the dishes on these trays was a branch of art ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 184" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 184</bibl>), the artist being called <seg lang="la">structor.</seg> Indeed, the arranging of the whole dinner was so important a function that it required a special majordomo called <seg lang="la">tricliniarcha</seg> (Henzen, Index, p. 189), with his special <seg lang="la">servi tricliniarii</seg> (Henzen, 6367). It was probably only at the imperial court that there were tasters (<seg lang="la">praegustatores</seg>). Between the <seg lang="la">promulsis</seg> and the <seg lang="la">cena</seg>, as well as after each course of the <seg lang="la">cena</seg>, the <seg lang="la">repositorium</seg> was carried away and brought back with the following course, the table having been previously wiped down ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8. 11" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8. 11</bibl>), and the bits that had fallen having been gathered up by the <seg lang="la">analecta</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  7. 20. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vii. 20. 17</bibl>). Occasionally the carver (<seg lang="la">carptor, diribitor, scissor</seg>), whose function the <seg lang="la">structor</seg> sometimes fulfilled ( <bibl n="Mart.  10. 48. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 48. 15</bibl>), carved the meat ( <bibl n="Petron.  36" default="NO">Petron.36</bibl> and 40) at the open side of the table, and it was carried round by slaves ( <bibl n="Petron.  33" default="NO">Petron.33</bibl> and 40). Carving, too, was a branch of art and had its learned professors ( <bibl n="Juv.  11. 137" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xi. 137</bibl>; cf. v. 120). Sometimes the course was put on the table and the guests themselves took what they desired, and in the way they did so it was easy to see what guests had the manners of good society (Lucian, <title>De Merc. Cond.</title> 15). There appear to have been <hi rend="italic">menus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματίδια</foreign>, Athen. ii. 49 d). Between each course the guests washed their hands (Lamprid. <title>Heliog.</title> 25), for it must be remembered that the Romans used to eat with their fingers ( <bibl n="Mart.  5. 78" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.v. 78</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 6</bibl>), except in the case of soup, eggs, and shell-fish, for which a <hi rend="italic">coclear</hi> (q. v.) and a <seg lang="la">ligula</seg> (q. v.) were used.</p>
 <p>The viands served up at luxurious dinner-parties are far too numerous to be described. Elaborate descriptions will be found in  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8</bibl>; Macrob. <title>Saturn.</title> ii. 9, 12; <bibl n="Petron.  33" default="NO">Petron.33</bibl> foll.; also in Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, chap. 8. They contained, as Philo says, “all the products of land and sea, rivers and air.” Copious accounts of the different kinds of foods and drinks are given in <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 331-367, 412-442; Marquardt, <title>Privatleben</title>, 398-448; Daremberg and Saglio, s. v. <title>Cicaria.</title> To admit of the gluttony required to consume such dinners, vomiting was resorted to, rules for which were 
<pb n="314" /><cb />
 laid down by physicians ( <bibl n="Cels.  1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Cels.i. 3</bibl><bibl n="Cels.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Cels., 29</bibl>, ed. Krause; Galen, vi. 391)—an indirect proof of the prevalence of over-eating among the wealthy. But such extravagance must have been confined to the upper classes, and can give us no idea of ordinary family meals. The bill of fare of a plain dinner is to be found in Martial (x. 48, 13 foll.). The main course consisted of kid, cutlets (<seg lang="la">ofellae</seg>), beans, early sprouts (<seg lang="la">prototomi</seg>), chicken, and cold ham. While eating, wine was usually drunk ( <bibl n="Petron.  34" default="NO">Petron.34</bibl>), but in small quantities, for it was thought to blunt the taste ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 8" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 8</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 38" default="NO"> Sat., 38</bibl>).</p>
 <p>After the <seg lang="la">cena</seg> proper was taken away, and the tables were removed, the offerings to the gods (the <seg lang="la">mola salsa</seg>, etc.) were thrown into the hearth; and when a slave announced that the gods were propitious, silence for a short time was observed in respect for the gods ( Serv. on <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 734" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>i. 734</bibl>). The gods were the Lares, and if they were not in the dining-room, they used to be carried in and placed on the table ( <bibl n="Petron.  60" default="NO">Petron.60</bibl>), or a special table with a salt cellar and some meat was placed before their shrine (Arnob. <title>adv. Gentes</title>, ii. 67).</p>
 <p>Thereafter followed the dessert, <seg lang="la">mensae secundae</seg> ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 122" default="NO"> Sat., 122</bibl>), also called <seg lang="la">bellaria</seg> ( <bibl n="Gel.  13.11.7" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii.11.7</bibl>), just as “second course” and “sweets” (in England) signify the same part of the meal. Other names were <hi rend="italic">impomenta</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδειπνίς</foreign>. It consisted of all sorts of pastry (see Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 363- 367), fresh and dried fruits, apples, grapes, etc. The <seg lang="la">mensae secundae</seg> formed the transition to the <hi rend="italic">commissatio</hi> (q. v.).</p>
 <p>At distinguished dinner-parties the company was amused in various ways. These amusements were called <seg lang="la">acroamata.</seg> (See Reid on  <bibl n="Cic. Arch. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Arch.</title>9</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Arch. 20." default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Arch., 20.</bibl>) Respectable and cultivated hosts used to afford readings by their <seg lang="la">anagnostae</seg> (Mayor on <bibl n="Juv.  11. 180" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xi. 180</bibl>), often of their own works, and we can well believe that this became an insufferable nuisance. It was no doubt a mark of culture to ask for some charming poetry ( <bibl n="Pers.  1. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.i. 30</bibl>). The practice of reading during meals is still kept up in Roman Catholic colleges. Music, too, used to be introduced, sometimes choral and orchestral performances (<seg lang="la">symphonia</seg>, <title>Verr.</title> iii. 44, 105; and Wilkins on <title>Ars Poet.</title> 374). There used to be actors also ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 15. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 15. 2</bibl>), and story-tellers (<seg lang="la">aretalogi</seg>,  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>74</bibl>). At “fast” entertainments there were introduced girls to play, sing, and dance ( <bibl n="Liv.  39. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxix. 6</bibl>;  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 2</bibl><bibl n="Enn.

These amusements were produced during the <seg lang="la">cena</seg> and continued on into the <hi rend="italic">commissatio</hi>, if such followed.</p>

<head orig="Censor">Censor</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τιμητής</foreign>). One of the officials whose duty it was (after B.C. 444) to take the place of the consuls in superintending the quinquennial census. The office was one of the higher magistracies, and could only be held once by the same person. It was at first confined to the patricians; but in B.C. 351 was thrown open to the plebeians, and after 339 one of the censors was obliged by law to be a plebeian. On the occasion of a census, the censors were elected soon after the accession to office of the new consuls, who presided over the assembly. They were usually chosen from the number of <seg lang="la">consulares</seg>, or persons who had been consuls. Accordingly the censorship was regarded, if not as the highest office of State, at least as the highest step in the ladder of promotion. The newly elected censors entered immediately, after due summons, upon their office. Its duration was fixed in B.C. 433 to eighteen months, but it could be extended for certain purposes. For the object of carrying out their proper duties—the census and the solemn purification (<seg lang="la">lustrum</seg>) that concluded it—they had the power of summoning the people to the Campus Martius, where, after B.C. 434, they had an official residence in the Villa Publica. The tribunes had no right of veto as against their proceedings in taking the census; indeed, so far as this part of their duties was concerned, they were irresponsible, being bound only in conscience by the oath which they took on entering upon and laying down their office. Having no executive powers, they had no lictors, but only messengers (<seg lang="la">viatores</seg>) and heralds (<seg lang="la">praecones</seg>). Their insignia were the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg> and a purple toga. The collegiate character of the office was so pronounced that, if one censor died the other abdicated. From the simple act of taking the census and putting up the new list of citizens, their functions were in course of time extended, so as to include a number of very important duties. Among these must be mentioned in particular a general superintendence of conduct (<seg lang="la">regimen morum</seg>). In virtue of this they had the power of setting a stigma upon any citizen, regardless of his position, for any conceivable offence for which there was no legal punishment. Such offences were neglect of one's property, celibacy, dissolution of marriage, bad training or bad treatment of children, undue severity to slaves and clients, irregular life, abuse of power in office, impiety, perjury, and the like. The offender might be punished with degradation—that is, the censors could expel a man from the Senate or the <seg lang="la">ordo equester</seg>; 
<pb n="315" /><cb /> or they could transfer him from a country tribe into one of the less respectable city tribes, and thus curtail his right of voting; or, again, they could expel him from the tribes altogether, and thus completely deprive him of the right of voting. This last penalty might be accompanied by a fine in the shape of additional taxation. The censors had also the power of issuing edicts against practices which threatened the simplicity of ancient Roman manners—for instance, against luxury. These edicts had not the force of law, but their transgression might be punished by the next censors. The effect of the censorial stigma and punishment lasted until the next census. The consent of both censors was required to ratify it, and it directly affected men only, not women. The censors exercised a special superintendence over the <seg lang="la">equites</seg> and the Senate. They had the <title>lectio Senatus</title>, or power of ejecting unworthy members and of passing over new candidates for the senatorial rank—as, for instance, those who had held curule offices. The <seg lang="la">equites</seg> had to pass singly, each leading his horse, before the censors in the Forum, after the completion of the general census. (See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Travectio</hi>.) An honourable dismissal was then given to the superannuated or the infirm; if an <seg lang="la">eques</seg> was now found, or had previously been found, unworthy of his order (as for neglecting to care for his horse), he was expelled from it. The vacant places were filled up from the number of such individuals as appeared from the general census to be suitable. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossequites">Equites</ref>.) There were certain other duties attached to the censorship, for the due performance of which they were responsible to the people, and subject to the authority of the Senate and the veto of the tribunes. (1) The letting of the public domain lands and taxes to the highest bidder.</p>
 <p>(2) The acceptance of tenders from the lowest bidder for works to be paid for by the State. In both these cases the period was limited to five years.</p>
 <p>(3) Superintendence of the construction and maintenance of public buildings and grounds, temples, bridges, sewers, aqueducts, streets, monuments, and the like.</p>
 <p>After B.C. 167, Roman citizens were freed from all taxation; and after the time of Marius, the liability to military service was made general. The censorship was now a superfluous office, for its original object, the census, was hardly necessary. Sulla disliked the censors for their power of meddling in matters of private conduct, and accordingly, in his constitution of B.C. 81, the office was, if not formally abolished, practically superseded. It was restored in B.C. 70, in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, and continued to exist for a long time, until under the Empire it disappeared as a separate office. The emperor kept in his own hands the right of taking the census. He took over also the other functions of the censor, especially the supervision of morals, a proceeding in which he had Caesar's example to support him. The care of public buildings, however, he committed to a special body.

<div2 id="crosscensorinus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Censorīnus">Censorinus</head>

 <p> (1) One of the ephemeral Roman emperors who appeared in so great numbers under the reign of Gallienus, and are known in later Roman history as “the Thirty Tyrants” (q.v.). Censorinus had been distinguished in camps and in the Senate: he had been twice consul, twice praetorian prefect, three times prefect of Rome, and four times proconsul. After having passed through this honourable career, <cb /> he retired to the country, being now advanced in years, and lame from a wound he had received in the war against the Persians during the reign of Valerian. It was under these circumstances that he was proclaimed emperor at Bologna, A.D. 270, in spite, as it would appear, of his own wishes; and by a species of pleasantry he was nicknamed Claudius, in allusion to his lameness (<seg lang="la">claudus</seg>, “lame”). The strict discipline, however, which he wished to introduce gave offence, and he was slain by the very soldiers who had raised him to the throne.</p>
 <p>(2) A grammarian and philosopher, who flourished under Maximus and Gordianus, about A.D. 238. He wrote a small work entitled <title>De Die Natali</title>, which was so called because composed on occasion of the birthday of his wealthy friend Q. Cerellius (A.D. 238), and largely taken from the <title>Pratum</title> of Suetonius. It treats of the time of birth; of the influence of one's genius, as well as that of the stars, upon the birth-period of an individual; and embraces many other topics of a chronological, mathematical, and cosmographical character. The style of Censorinus is good, though not free from the blemishes natural to his time. We have also a fragment, <title>De Metris</title>, ascribed to the same writer. He composed also a work on accents, and another on geometry, but these last two have not reached us. The principal MSS. are the Codex Coloniensis (formerly Darmstadtiensis) of the seventh century, and one in the Vatican of the tenth ceutury. The first critical edition of Censorinus was that of Jahn <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1845)</bibl>. A later one is that of Hultsch <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1867)</bibl>.</p>

<head orig="Census">Census</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τίμημα</foreign>). A register of persons and property, constituting a claim to the rights of citizenship at Athens and at Rome.</p>
 <p>I. At <hi rend="SmallCaps">Athens</hi>. The census at Athens seems to date from the constitution of Solon. This legislator made four classes (<foreign lang="greek">τιμήματα, τέλη</foreign>). <title>(a) Pentacosiomedimni</title>, or those who received 500 measures, dry or liquid, from their lands. <title>(b) Knights</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ἵππεις</foreign>), who had an income of 300 measures. <title>(c) Zeugitae</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ζευγῖται</foreign>), whose income was 150 measures. <title>(d) Thetes</title> (<foreign lang="greek">θῆτες</foreign>), or <seg lang="la">capite censi.</seg> The word <foreign lang="greek">τίμημα</foreign>, as used in the orators, means the valuation of the property—i. e. not the capital itself, but the taxable capital. Now, if the valuation of the income was that given in the distribution of the classes just mentioned, it is not difficult to get at the valuation of the capital implied. Solon reckoned the dry measure, or <seg lang="la">medimnus</seg>, at a drachma. But it is probable that the income was reckoned at a twelfth part of the value of the land, on the same principle which originated the <seg lang="la">unciarium foenus</seg>, or 8 1/3 per cent., at Rome; and if so, the landed property of a <hi rend="italic">pentacosiomedimnus</hi> was reckoned at a talent, or 12X500=6000 drachmas; that of a <hi rend="italic">knight</hi> at 12X300=3600 drachmas; and that of a <seg lang="la">zeugites</seg> at 12X150=1800 drachmas. In the first class, the whole estate was considered as taxable capital; but in the second, only 5/6, or 3000 drachmas; and in the third, 5/9, or 1000 drachmas; to which Pollux alludes when he says, in his clumsy way, that the first class expended one talent on the public account; the second, 30 minas; the third, 10 minas; and the <hi rend="italic">thetes</hi>, nothing.</p>
 <p>In order to settle in what class a man should 
<pb n="316" /><cb />
 be entered on the register (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπογραφή</foreign>), he returned a valuation of his property, subject, perhaps, to the check of a counter-valuation (<foreign lang="greek">ὑποτίμησις</foreign>). The valuation was made very frequently; in some states, every year; in others, every two or four years. The censors, who kept the register at Athens, were probably at first the <hi rend="italic">naucrari;</hi> but afterwards the demarchs performed the office of censor. Although this institution of Solon's seems particularly calculated for the imposition of the property tax (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσφορά</foreign>), Thucydides (i. 141), speaking of the year B.C. 428, says that it was then that the Athenians first raised a property tax of 200 talents. It seems, however, that the amount of the tax constituted its singularity; for certainly property-taxes were common not only in Athens, but in the rest of Greece, before the Peloponnesian War, and Antipho expressly says that he contributed to <hi rend="italic">many</hi> of them. In the archonship of Nausinicus (Olym. 100, 3; B.C. 378) a new valuation of property took place, and classes (<foreign lang="greek">συμμορίαι</foreign>) were introduced expressly for the property taxes. The nature of these classes, our knowledge of which principally depends on a note of Ulpian, is involved in considerable obscurity. Thus much, however, may be stated, that they consisted of 1200 individuals—120 from each of the ten tribes—who, by way of a sort of liturgy, advanced the money for others liable to the tax, and got it from them by the ordinary legal processes. In a similar manner classes were subsequently formed for the discharge of another and more serious liturgy, the trierarchy; and the <seg lang="la">strategi</seg>, who nominated the trierarchs, had also to form the <hi rend="italic">symmoriae</hi> for the property taxes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>.) What we have here said of the census at Athens renders it unnecessary to speak of the similar registrations in other states of Greece. When the constitution essentially depended on this distribution according to property, it was called a timocracy, or aristocracy of property (<foreign lang="greek">τιμοκρατία, ἀπὸ τιμημάτων πολιτεία</foreign>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) At <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Rome</ref>. After the establishment of the constitution of Servius Tullius, the number of Roman citizens was ascertained every five years (though not always with perfect regularity), to determine their legal liability to the payment of taxes and to military service. This process was called <seg lang="la">census.</seg> The census was originally taken by the kings; after the expulsion of the kings, by the consuls; and after B.C. 444, by special officers called <seg lang="la">censores.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscensor">Censor</ref>.) The censors took the auspices on the night preceding the census; on the next day, their herald summoned the people to the Campus Martius, where they had an official residence in the Villa Publica. Each tribe appeared successively before them, and its citizens were summoned individually according to the existing register. Each had to state on oath his age, his own name, those of his father, his wife, his children, his abode, and the amount of his property. The facts were embodied in lists by the censors' assistants. The census of the provinces was sent in by the provincial governors. There was a special commission for numbering the armies outside the Italian frontier. The censors, in putting up the new lists, took into consideration not only a man's property, but his moral conduct. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscensor">Censor</ref>.) The census was concluded with the solemn ceremony of reviewing the newly constituted army (<seg lang="la">lustrum</seg>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslustrum">Lustrum</ref>.) The republican census continued to exist under the early <cb /> Empire, but the last <seg lang="la">lustrum</seg> was held by Vespasian and Titus in A.D. 74. The provincial census, introduced by Augustus and maintained during the whole imperial period, had nothing to do with the Roman census, being only a means of ascertaining the taxable capacities of the provinces.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κένταυροι</foreign>). A Thessalian race fabled to have been half men, half horses. The Centaurs and Lapithae are two mythical tribes, which are always mentioned together.

It is very doubtful whether Homer and Hesiod conceived them to be of a mingled form, as they were subsequently represented. In the fight of the Centaurs and Lapithae depicted on the shield of Heracles, the latter appear in panoply fighting with spears, while the former wield pine clubs. Pindar is the earliest <figure id="fig.00316">
<head orig="Centaur. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)">Centaur. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> poet extant who expressly describes them as semiferine. According to him (<title>Pyth.</title> ii. 78 foll.), the offspring of <ref type="cross" target="crossixion">Ixion</ref> (q.v.) and the cloud, was a son named Centaurus, who, when grown up, wandered about the foot of Mount Pelion, where he united with the Magnesian mares, who brought forth the Centaurs—a race partaking of the form of both parents, their lower parts resembling their dams, and their upper parts their sire. The common account makes the Centaurs to have been the immediate offspring of Ixion and the cloud. By his wife Dia, Ixion had a son named Pirithoüs, who married Hippodamia, daughter of Adrastus, king of Argos. The chiefs of his own tribe, the Lapithae, were all invited to the wedding, as were also the Centaurs, 
<pb n="317" /><cb />
 who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Pelion. Theseus, Nestor , and other strangers were likewise present. At the feast, Eurytion, one of the Centaurs, becoming intoxicated with the wine, attempted to offer violence to the bride; the other Centaurs followed his example, and a dreadful conflict arose, in which several of them were slain. The Centaurs were finally driven from Pelion, and obliged to retire to other regions. <figure id="fig.00317">
<head orig="Centaur and Eros. (Louvre.)">Centaur and Eros. (Louvre.)</head>

 <p>According to the earliest version of this legend, Eurytion, the Centaur, being invited to the mansion of Pirithoüs, became intoxicated, and behaved so ill to the women that the heroes rose, and, dragging him to the door, cut off his ears and nose, which was the occasion of the “strife between the Centaurs and men” ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 21. 295" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxi. 295</bibl> foll.). When Heracles was on his way to hunt the Erymanthian boar, he was entertained by the Centaur Pholus; and this gave rise to a conflict between him and the other Centaurs, which terminated in the total discomfiture of the latter.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κέντρων</foreign>). Properly, a patch work garment. In its secondary meaning the word was applied to a poem composed of verses or parts of verses by wellknown poets, put together at pleasure so as to make a new meaning. Homer and Vergil were chiefly used for the purpose. The Christians were fond of making religious poems in this way, hoping thus to give a nobler colouring to the pagan poetry. For instance, we have an Homeric cento (<title>HomeroCentones</title>) of 2343 verses on the life of Christ, ascribed to Athenaïs, <cb /> who, under the title of Eudociawas consort of the emperor Theodosius II. Another instance is a poem known as the <title>Christus Patiens</title>, or “the suffering Christ,” consisting of 2610 verses from Euripides.

<div2 id="crosscentumviri" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Centumvĭri">Centumviri</head>

 <p> Judges belonging to a court which was one of the two permanent courts of plebeian judges, instituted, probably, by Servius Tullius, and continuing until the fall of the Western Empire. The other collegium was that of the <hi rend="italic">decemviri</hi> (q. v.). The actual number of centumviri varied at different periods. Festus (s. v. <seg lang="la">centumviralia iudicia</seg>) says that they were nominated by the praetor, three being taken from each of the thirty tribes. The ninety thus obtained would, with the presiding decemviri, make up the exact sum which the name denotes. When the number of tribes was increased in B.C. 241 to 35, there were 105 centumviri; but the old name was retained, according to Festus, for convenience, and under the Empire the number had risen to 180 ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 6. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>vi. 33</bibl>). At this time it is improbable that they were any longer selected from the tribes, between whose number and their own there was no relation. From a passage of Dio Casius, one might conjecture that they were taken by lot from the <seg lang="la">decuriae iudicum</seg> instituted by Augustus; and from Ovid (<bibl n="Ov. Tr. 2.96" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Trist.</title> ii. 96</bibl>), that no one could escape the duty if drawn. It would seem that under the Republic the court had no jurisdiction unless the whole number of members sat together, for it was only in the aggregate that they represented the people; but later (probably under Augustus) it was divided into four divisions or sub-courts, which sat and judged apart and independently of each other for the quicker despatch of business ( <bibl n="Quint. Inst. 13. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint. <title>Inst.</title>xiii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Quint. Inst. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint. Inst., 6</bibl>), though some causes were heard by two divisions sitting together (ib. v. 2<bibl n="Quint. Inst. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint. Inst., 1</bibl>), and others even by the whole united body (ib. vi. 33), which then ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 5. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>v. 21</bibl>), as under the Republic, was presided over by a praetor. The old custom was for the court to sit in the open Forum, but in Quintilian's time (xii. 5, 6) the four divisions sat on raised seats (<hi rend="italic">tribunalia</hi>) in the Basilica Iulia.</p>
 <p>The procedure before the centumviri was always that of the <seg lang="la">legis actio</seg> called <seg lang="la">sacramentum.</seg> Even when the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> in the aggregate were swept away by the Lex Aebutia, about B.C. 240 (Voigt), the old process was expressly retained by that statute for <seg lang="la">centumviralia iudicia</seg> (<bibl n="Gaius  4. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, iv. 31</bibl>; <bibl n="Gel.  16. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xvi. 10</bibl>).</p>
 <p>It seems to be the better opinion that the jurisdiction of the centumviri was limited to civil causes. The civil suits which fell under their cognizance especially were those known as real actions ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 1. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>de Orat.</title>i. 38</bibl><bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 173" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. de Orat., 173</bibl>), while the decemviri were

 more particularly concerned with questions of status (<seg lang="la">libertas, civitas, familia:</seg> <title>Pro Caec.</title> 33, 97; <title>Pro Domo</title>, 29, 78). The real actions comprise all suits claiming property or <seg lang="la">iura in re aliena</seg>, such as a right of way, a usufruct, etc., and those relating to inheritances; the scope of the centumviral jurisdiction is denoted by the planting of the <seg lang="la">hasta</seg> (the symbol of Quiritary ownership) in the ground where the court was sitting ( <title>Octav.</title> 36), and by the use of the <seg lang="la">festuca</seg> in the sacramental procedure.

<head orig="Cephălus">Cephalus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κέφαλος</foreign>). (1) The son of Deïon, and a grandson of Aeolus, married to Procris, the eldest daughter of Erechtheus. They dwelt at Thoricos in Attica, and lived happily together till curiosity to try the fidelity of his wife entered the <cb /> mind of Cephalus. Feigning a journey of eight years, he disguised himself and came to Procris with a splendid jewel, which he offered to her on dishonourable terms. After much hesitation she yielded, when her husband discovered himself and reproached her with her conduct. She fled from him in shame, but they were soon after reconciled. Cephalus went constantly to the chase; and Procris growing suspicious, as she had failed herself, fancied that he was attracted by the charms of some other fair one. She questioned the slave who used to accompany him; and he told her that his master used frequently to ascend the summit of a hill and cry out, “Come, Nephelé, come!” Procris went to the designated hill and concealed herself in a thicket; and on her husband's crying, “Come, Nephelé, come!” (which was nothing more than an invocation for some cloud, <foreign lang="greek">ϝεφέλη</foreign>, to interpose itself between him and the scorching beams of the sun), she rushed forward towards her husband, who, in his astonishment, threw his dart and unwittingly killed her. (See Hyg. 189; cf. Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 7. 661" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>vii. 661</bibl> foll.) This legend is told with great variations. Cephalus, for his involuntary crime, was banished. He went to Thebes, which was at that time ravaged by a fox which nothing could overtake, and he joined Amphitryon in the chase of it. His dog Laelaps ran it down; but, just as he was catching it, Zeus turned them both to stone. Cephalus then aided Amphitryon against the Teleboans, and on their conquest he settled in the island named from him Cephallenia.</p>

 <p> (from the √ <hi rend="SmallCaps">kr</hi> of <seg lang="la">creare</seg>). An old Italian goddess of agriculture. The Ceres who was worshipped at Rome is, however, the same as the Greek Demeter. Her cult was introduced under the Italian name at the same time as that of Dionysus and Persephoné, who in the same way <figure id="fig.00320">
<head orig="Ceres. (Pompeian Wall-painting.)">Ceres. (Pompeian Wall-painting.)</head>
</figure> received the Italian names of Liber and Libera. (See Cic. <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>N. D.</title>ii. 24</bibl><bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2." default="NO" valid="yes"> N. D., 2.</bibl>) It was in B.C. 496, on the occasion of a drought, that the Sibylline Books ordered the introduction of the worship of the three deities. This worship was so decidedly Greek that the temple dedicated on a spur of the Aventine in B.C. 490, over the entrance to the Circus, <cb /> was built in Greek style and by Greek artists; and the service of the goddess, founded on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephoné, was performed in the Greek tongue by Italian women of Greek extraction. The worshippers of the goddess were almost exclusively plebeian. Her temple was placed under the care of the plebeian aediles, who, as overseers of the corn market, had their official residence in or near it. The fines which they imposed went to the shrine of Ceres, as did the property of persons who had offended against them or against the tribunes of the plebs. Just as the patricians entertained each other with mutual hospitalities at the Megalesian Games (April 4-10), so did the plebeians at the Cerealia, or games introduced at the founding of the Temple of Ceres. Those held in later times were given by the aediles from the 12th to the 19th of April, and another festival to Ceres, held in August, was established before the Second Punic War. This was celebrated by women in honour of the reunion of Ceres and Proserpina. After fasting for nine days, the women, clothed in white, and adorned with crowns of ripe ears of corn, offered to the goddess the first-fruits of the harvest. After B.C. 191, a fast (<title>ieiunium Cereris</title>) was introduced by command of the Sibylline Books. This was originally observed every four years, but in later times was kept annually on the 4th of October. The native Italian worship of Ceres was probably maintained in its purest form in the country. Here the countrymen offered Ceres a sow (<seg lang="la">porca praecidanea</seg>) before the beginning of the harvest, and dedicated to her the first cuttings of the corn (<seg lang="la">praemetium</seg>).

Of the barley drink called <foreign lang="greek">πῖνον</foreign>, Aristotle tells us that those inebriated by it fall on the back and on no other part of the body (Athen. x. 447). We are told by Xenophon that the Armenians, instead of drinking their ale or beer out of cups, placed it before them in a large bowl. This being full to the brim with the grains as well as the fermented liquor, the guests, when they pledged one another, drank together out of the same bowl by stooping down to it, although, when this token of friendship was not intended, they adopted the more refined method of sucking up the fluid through tubes of cane ( <bibl n="Xen.

Thus Posidonius, in Athenaeus, says that while the richer classes in Gaul import wine from Italy and the district of Marseilles, the poor drink a beer made from wheat, with or without the addition of honey, which is called <foreign lang="greek">κόρμα</foreign>. This Gallic use of beer is illustrated by a curious circular bottle found in Gaul and preserved in the Musée Carnavalet at Paris: it bears the legend, “Ospita reple lagona cervesa” (<title>Revue Archéologique</title>, 1868, xviii. 226).</p>
 <p>The beverage of the Germans was made from barley or wheat ( <bibl n="Stat. Germ. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Germ.</title>23</bibl>).

The Greeks and Romans regarded this barbarian drink with contempt, as is seen by an epigram of the emperor Julian (<title>Anth. Pal.</title> ix. 365).

Such a vestibule is found in many Christian basilicas; the former type occurs in St. John Lateran and Sta. Maria Maggiore at Rome, the latter in St. Ambrogio at Milan. The foundations show that a chalcidicum of this kind once existed in front of the vast basilica of Constantine at Rome.

It was a very ancient town, originally inhabited by Abantes or Curetes, and colonized by Attic Ionians. Its flourishing condition at an early period is attested by the numerous colonies which it planted <cb /> in various parts of the Mediterranean. It founded so many cities in the peninsula in Macedonia, between the Strymonic and Thermaic gulfs, that the whole peninsula was called Chalcidicé. In Italy it founded Cumae, and in Sicily, Naxos. Chalcis was usually subject to Athens during the greatness of the latter city. The orator Isaeus and the poet Lycophron were born at Chalcis, and Aristotle died there.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκοῦς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χαλκίον</foreign>). Under <ref type="cross" target="crossaes">Aes</ref> some account has been given of the use of bronze or copper for money, which began in most parts of the Greek world about B.C. 400. At Athens, the chalcus, or “copper” <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg>, is said by Pollux (ix. 65) to have been equivalent to the eighth of an obol; in some other places it was the sixth of an obol, and contained seven lepta.</p>
 <p>Copper coins (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκία</foreign>) were first issued at Athens in the archonship of Callias, B.C. 406. In the <title>Ecclesiazusae</title> (816) Aristophanes speaks of the demonetization of certain copper coins, and the reversion to a silver currency. It seems likely that the coins referred to in both these passages are the pieces still extant with the head of Athené on one side, and an owl with two bodies and one head on the other, which resemble the silver diobols of Athens. Coins of late period struck in Syria bear the inscription <foreign lang="greek">χαλκοῦς</foreign>, which declares their value. <foreign lang="greek">Δίχαλκα</foreign> and other multiples of the chalcus were also struck at Chios and other places. When, however, bronze coins do not bear inscriptions stating their value, the latter cannot with certainty be fixed. See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumismatics">Numismatics</ref>.

Some time after, he was sent to aid Byzantium against Philip of Macedon, but he only incurred the contempt of his foe, and excited the discontent of the allies, so that the Athenians finally recalled him, and put Phocion in his place. This, however, did not prevent them from choosing him for their general at the battle of Chaeronaea, where his ignorance and incapacity mainly contributed to the loss of the day.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Χάριτες</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Gratiae</hi> (Graces). Goddesses of grace, and of everything which lends charm and beauty to nature and human life. According to Hesiod, they are the offspring of Zeus and the daughter of Oceanus and Eurynomé. Their names are Euphrosyné (Joy), Thalia (Bloom), 
<pb n="325" /><cb />
 and Aglaïa (Brilliance). Aglaïa is the youngest, and the wife of Hephaestus; for the inspiration of the Graces was deemed as necessary to the plastic arts as to music, poetry, science, eloquence, beauty, and enjoyment of life. Accordingly, the Graces are intimate with the Muses, with whom they live together on Olympus. They are associated, too, with Apollo, Athené, Hermes, and Peitho, but especially with Eros, Aphrodité, and Dionysus. Bright and blithe-hearted, they were also called the daughters of the Sun and of Aeglé (Gleam). They were worshipped in conjunction with Aphrodité and Dionysus at Orchomenus in Boeotia, where their shrine was accounted the oldest in the place, and where their most ancient images were found in the shape of stones said to have fallen from heaven. It was here that the feast of the Charitesia was held in their honour, with musical contests. At Sparta, as at Athens, two Charites only were worshipped, Cleta, or Sound, and Phaënna, or Light; at Athens their names were Auxo (Increase) and Hegemoné (Queen). It was by these goddesses, and by Agraulos daughter of Cecrops, that the Athenian youths, on receiving their spear and shield, swore faith to their country. The Charites were represented in the form of beautiful maidens, the three being generally linked hand in hand. In the older representations they are clothed; in the later, they are loosely clad or entirely undraped.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Χάρων</foreign>). (1) A deity of the lower world, son of Erebus and Nyx, who conducted the souls of the dead in a boat over the river Acheron to the infernal regions. The sum exacted for this service, from each of the shades ferried over by him, was never less than an obolus, nor could it exceed three. A piece of money, therefore, was generally placed by the ancients under the tongue of the deceased, in order to meet this necessary demand. Such as had not been honoured with a funeral were not <cb /> permitted to enter Charon 's boat without previously wandering on the shore for one hundred years. If any living person presented himself to cross the river of the dead, he could not be admitted into the bark before he showed Charon a golden bough, obtained from the Cumaean sibyl; and the ferryman was on one occasion imprisoned for an entire year because he had, though against <figure id="fig.00325">
<head orig="Charon. (Stackelberg.)">Charon. (Stackelberg.)</head>
</figure> his own will, conveyed Heracles across the stream without first receiving from him this necessary passport. The poets have represented Charon as a robust old man, of a severe though animated countenance, with eyes glowing like flame, a white and bushy head, vestments of a dingy colour, stained with the mire of the stream, and with a pole for the direction of his bark, which last is of a dark rusty hue.</p>
 <p>The earliest mention of Charon in Grecian poetry seems to be in the ancient poem of the Minyas, quoted by Pausanias (x. 28). The fable itself is considered by some to be of Egyptian origin, and in support of this opinion they refer to the account of Diodorus Siculus relative to the statements made by the Egyptian priests. The latter asserted, it seems, that Orpheus and Homer had both learned wisdom on the banks of the Nile; and that the Erebus of Greece, and all its parts, personages, and usages, were but transcripts of the mode of burial in Egypt; and here the corpse was, on payment of an obolus, conveyed by a ferryman (named Charon in the language of Egypt) over the Acherusian Lake after it had received its sentence from the judges appointed for that pur<figure id="fig.00325.2">

</figure> pose.</p>
 <p>(2) One of the earlier Greek historical writers, a native of Lampsacus, supposed to have flourished between the seventy-fifth and seventyeighth Olympiads, about B.C. 464. Charon continued the researches of Hecataeus into Eastern ethnography. He wrote (as was the custom of the historians of his day) separate works upon Persia, Libya, Aethiopia, etc. He also subjoined the history of his own time, and he preceded Herodotus in narrating the events of the Persian War, although Herodotus nowhere mentions him. From 
<pb n="326" /><cb />
 the fragments of his writings which remain, it is manifest that his relation to Herodotus was that of a dry chronicler to an historian, under whose hands everything acquires life and character. Charon wrote, besides, a chronicle of his own country, as several of the early historians did, who were thence called “Horographers” (<foreign lang="greek">ὧροι</foreign>, corresponding to the Latin <seg lang="la">annales</seg>, ought not to be confounded with <foreign lang="greek">ὅροι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">termini, limites</seg>).

<div2 id="crosscharondas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Charondas">Charondas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Χαρώνδας</foreign>). A celebrated legislator, born at Catana in Sicily, where he flourished about B.C. 650. We have very few details of his life. Aristotle merely informs us that he was of the bourgeois class of citizens, and that he framed laws for the people of Catana, as well as for other communities which, like them, were descended from Chalcis in Euboea. Aelian adds (<title>V. H.</title> iii. 17) that he was subsequently driven into exile from Catana, and took refuge in Rhegium, where he succeeded in introducing his laws. Some authors inform us that he compiled his laws for the Thurians; but he lived, in fact, a long time before the foundation of Thurium, since his laws were abrogated in part by Anaxilaüs, tyrant of Rhegium, who died B.C. 476. The laws of Charondas were, like those of many of the ancient legislators, in verse, and formed part of the instruction of the young. Their fame reached even to Athens, where they were sung or chanted at repasts. The preamble of these laws, as preserved to us by Stobaeus, is thought, so far, at least, as regards the form of expression, not to be genuine; and Heyne supposes it to have been taken from some Pythagorean treatise on the laws of Charondas.</p>
 <p>The manner of this legislator's death is deserving of mention. He had made a law that no man should be allowed to come armed into the assembly of the people. The penalty for infringement was death. He became the victim of his own law; for, having returned from pursuing some robbers, he entered the city, and presented himself before the assembly of the people without reflecting that he carried a sword by his side. Some one thereupon remarked to him, “You are violating your own law.” His reply was, “On the contrary, by Zeus, I will establish it”; and he slew himself on the spot.

<head orig="Cheirotonia">Cheirotonia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χειροτονία</foreign>). In the Athenian assemblies two modes of voting were practised—the one by ballot (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspsephus">Psephus</ref>), the other by a show <cb /> of hands (<foreign lang="greek">χειροτονεῖν</foreign>). The latter was the usual mode of conducting business. Secret voting, in general, was only used when the personal interests of individuals were concerned; as when the question was the condemnation or acquittal of a person put upon his trial, the remission of a punishment or of a pecuniary fine payable to the State, the conferring of citizenship on strangers, or finally the banishment of a citizen by ostracism. Open voting was employed on questions of public policy, such as war or peace, in voting upon laws, and in some special kinds of trials on matters which concerned the people, as upon <foreign lang="greek">προβολαί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">εῖσαγγελία</foreign>. In the elections of magistrates (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαιρεσίαι</foreign>), some were chosen by lot (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ κληρωτή</foreign>); others, and these of course the more important— e. g. the <foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign>—by show of hands (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχὴ αἱρετὴ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χειροτονητή</foreign>). The undoubted distinction between <foreign lang="greek">ψηφίζεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χειροτονεῖν</foreign> is not always observed: we find the word <foreign lang="greek">ψηφίζεσθαι</foreign> used where the voting was really by show of hands (Demos. <title>Olynth.</title> i. 2).</p>
 <p>The <foreign lang="greek">χειροτονία</foreign> was taken first on the affirmative, then on the negative, side of the question at issue: the number of hands was counted each time by the herald; and the president, upon the herald's report, declared whether the ayes or noes had the majority.</p>
 <p>It is important to understand clearly the compounds of this word. A vote condemning an accused person is <foreign lang="greek">καταχειροτονία</foreign>: one acquitting him, <foreign lang="greek">ἀποχειροτονία· ἐπιχειροτονεῖν</foreign> is to confirm by a majority of votes: <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχειροτονία τῶν νόμων</foreign> was a revision of the laws, which took place at the beginning of the Attic year in the month of Hecatombaeon: <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχειροτονία τῶν ἀρχῶν</foreign> was a vote taken in the first assembly of each prytany on the conduct of the magistrates. In these cases, those who voted for the confirmation of the law, or the continuance in office of the magistrate, were said <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχειροτονεῖν</foreign>, those on the other side <foreign lang="greek">ἀποχειροτονεῖν· διαχειροτονία</foreign> is a vote for one of two alternatives; <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιχειροτονεῖν</foreign> to vote against a proposition; <foreign lang="greek">προχειροτονία</foreign> is the show of hands on the previous question—i. e. whether the people desired further discussion or not. The compounds of <foreign lang="greek">ψηφίζεσθαι</foreign> have similar meanings (Schömann, <title>Assemblies</title>, pp. 120, 125, 231, 251, 330).

 <p>The most noted Chersonesi in ancient times were the following: (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Chersonesus Aurea</hi>, or Golden Chersonesus, a peninsula of Farther India, corresponding, according to D'Anville, Rennell, Mannert, and others, to the modern Malacca. The positive knowledge of the ancient geographers can hardly be said to have extended much beyond this, their account of the regions farther to the east being principally derived from the natives of India. The name given to this region by the ancients has reference to the popular belief of its abounding in gold; and here, too, some inquirers into early geography have placed the Ophir of Solomon, an opinion maintained also by Iosephus.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Chersonesus Cimbrĭca</hi>, a peninsula in the northern part of Germany, answering to the modern Jutland and Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Chersonesus Taurĭca</hi>, a peninsula between the Pontus Euxinus and the Palus Maeotis, answering to the modern Crimea. The name was derived from the Tauri, a barbarous race who inhabited it. It was sometimes called Chersonesus Scythica and Chersonesus Magna.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Chersonesus Thracĭca</hi>, often called simply “the Chersonesus,” and the most important of all. It was a peninsula of Thrace, between the Sinus Melas and the Hellespont. The fertility of its soil, and its proximity to the coast of Asia Minor, early attracted an influx of Grecian settlers, and its shores soon became crowded with flourishing and populous cities. From this quarter the Athenians drew their chief supply of grain.

Clearchus, who ruled at Heraclea, was not, it is true, a good prince; but, in slaying him, Chion was the cause of this city's falling under a worse tyrant, Satyrus, the brother of Clearchus. Chion himself fell a victim to the latter's elevation to power (B.C. 353). We have seventeen letters said to have been written by Chion.

 <p>Like similar words in all languages, it acquired several technical senses. From its first meaning was easily derived that of a signature to a will or other instrument, especially a note of hand given by a debtor to his creditor. In this latter case it did not constitute the legal obligation (for the debt might be proved in some other way); it was only a proof of the obligation. 
<pb n="329" /><cb /></p>
 <p>According to Asconius (<title>in Verr.</title> iii. 36), <seg lang="la">chirographum</seg>, in the sense of a promissory note, was distinguished from <seg lang="la">syngrapha;</seg> the former was always given for money actually lent, the latter might be a mere sham agreement to pay a debt which had never been actually incurred. The <seg lang="la">chirographum</seg> was kept by the creditor, and had only the debtor's signature; the <seg lang="la">syngrapha</seg>, on the contrary, was signed and kept by both parties.

 <p>In the Latin of the Middle Ages, <seg lang="la">chirographum</seg> was used to signify tribute collected under the sign-manual of a person in authority, similar to the briefs and benevolences of former times in Great Britain. It was also used, till comparatively recent times, in the English law for an indenture. Duplicates of deeds were written on one piece of parchment, with the word <seg lang="la">chirographum</seg> between them, which was cut in two in a straight or wavy line, and the parts given to the care of the persons concerned. By the canonists, as Blackstone remarks, the word <seg lang="la">syngrapha</seg> or <seg lang="la">syngraphus</seg> was employed in the same way, and hence gave its name to these kinds of writing.

To Chiron was intrusted the rearing and educating of Iason and his son Medeus, Heracles, Aesculapius, and Achilles. Besides his knowledge of the musical art, which he imparted to his heroic pupils, he was also skilled in surgery, which he taught to <cb /> the last two of this number. In the contest between Heracles and the Centaurs, Chiron was accidentally wounded in the knee by one of the arrows of the hero. Grieved at this unhappy event, Heracles ran up, drew out the arrow, and applied to the wound a remedy given by Chiron himself. But in vain; the venom of the hydra was not to be overcome. Chiron retired to his cave longing to die, but unable on account of his immortality, till, on his expressing his willingness to die for Prometheus, he was released by death from his misery. According to another account, he was, on his prayer to Zeus for relief, raised to the sky and made the constellation of Sagittarius.

<head orig="Chirurgia">Chirurgia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χειρουργία</foreign>). Surgery; a word meaning literally “handiwork.” The practice of surgery was at first considered by the ancients to be merely a part of a physician's duty; but, as in later times the two branches of the profession were to a great extent separated, it will perhaps be more convenient to treat of it under a separate head. Without touching upon the disputed question, which is the more ancient branch of the profession, or even trying to give such a definition of the word <seg lang="la">chirurgia</seg> as would be likely to satisfy both the physicians and the surgeons of the present day, it will be sufficient to determine the sense in which the word was used by the ancients; and then to give an account of this division of the science and art of medicine as practised among the Greeks and Romans, referring to the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmedicina">Medicina</ref> for further particulars.
<pb n="330" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">chirurgia</seg> is derived from <foreign lang="greek">χείρ</foreign>, “the hand,” and <foreign lang="greek">ἔργον</foreign>, “a work,” and is explained by Celsus (<title>De Med.</title> lib. vii. Praefat.) to mean that part of medicine <seg lang="la">quae manu curat</seg>, “which treats ailments by means of the hand”; in Diogenes Laertius (iii. 85) it is said to cure <foreign lang="greek">διὰ τοῦ τέμνειν καὶ καίειν</foreign>, “by cutting and burning.” Omitting the fabulous and mythological personages, Apollo, Aesculapius, Chiron, etc., the only certain traditions respecting the state of surgery before the establishment of the republics of Greece, and even until the time of the Peloponnesian War, are to be found in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title> There it appears that surgery was almost entirely confined to the treatment of wounds, and the imaginary power of enchantment was joined with the use of topical applications ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3. 218" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>iii. 218</bibl>). The Greeks received surgery, together with the other branches of medicine, from the Egyptians; and from some observations made by the archaeologists who accompanied the French expedition to Egypt in 1798, and by subsequent investigators, it appears that there are documents fully proving that in very remote times this extraordinary people had reached a degree of proficiency of which few of the moderns have any conception. Upon the ceilings and walls of the temples at Karnac, Luxor, etc., bas-reliefs are seen, representing limbs that have been cut off with instruments very similar to those which are employed for amputations at the present day. The same instruments are again observed in the hieroglyphics, and vestiges of other surgical operations may be traced, which afford convincing proofs of the skill of the ancient Egyptians in this branch of medical science.</p>
 <p>The earliest remaining surgical writings are those in the Hippocratic Collection, where there are ten treatises on this subject, of which, however, only one is considered undoubtedly genuine. Hippocrates (B.C. 460-357?) far surpassed all his predecessors in the boldness and success of his operations; and though the scanty knowledge of anatomy possessed in those times prevented his attaining any very great perfection, still one should rather admire his genius, which enabled him to do so much, than blame him because, with his imperfect information, he could not accomplish more. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshippocrates">Hippocrates</ref>.) The scientific skill in reducing fractures and luxations displayed in his works <title>De Fracturis, De Articulis</title>, excites the admiration of Haller (<title>Biblioth. Chirurg.</title>); and he was most probably the inventor of the <hi rend="italic">ambe</hi>, an old surgical machine for dislocations of the shoulder, which, though now fallen into disuse, enjoyed for a long time a great reputation. In his work <title>De Capitis Vulneribus</title> he gives minute directions about the time and mode of using the trephine, and warns the operator against the probability of his being deceived by the sutures of the cranium, as he confesses happened to himself (<title>De Morb. Vulgar.</title> lib. v. tom. iii. p. 561, ed. Kühn). Amputation, in the modern sense of the word, is not described in the Hippocratic Collection; though mention is made of the removal of a limb at the joint, after the flesh has been completely destroyed by gangrene. The author of the “Oath” commonly attributed to Hippocrates binds his pupils not to perform the operation of lithotomy, but to leave it to persons specially accustomed to it (<foreign lang="greek">ἐργάτῃσι ἀνδράσι πρήξιος τῆσδε</foreign>); <cb /> from which it would appear as if certain persons confined themselves to particular operations.</p>
 <p>The names of several persons are preserved who practised surgery as well as medicine in the times immediately succeeding those of Hippocrates; but, with the exception of some fragments, inserted in the writings of Galen, Oribasius, Aëtius, etc., all their writings have perished. Archagathus deserves to be mentioned, as he is said to have been the first foreign surgeon who settled at Rome, B.C. 219 ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 29.  12" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxix. 12</bibl>). He was at first very well received, the <title>ius Quiritium</title> was conferred upon him, a shop was bought for him at the public expense, and he received the honourable title of Vulnerarius; which, however, on account of his frequent use of the knife and cautery, was soon changed by the Romans, who were unused to such a mode of practice, into that of Carnifex. Asclepiades, who lived at the beginning of the first century B.C., is said to have been the first person who proposed the operation of tracheotomy ( Aurel. <title>De Morb. Acut.</title> i. 14. 111; iii. 4. 39). Ammonius of Alexandria, surnamed <foreign lang="greek">Λιθοτόμος</foreign>, who is supposed to have lived rather later, is celebrated in the annals of surgery for having been the first to propose and to perform the operation of lithotrity, or breaking a calculus in the bladder when found to be too large for safe extraction. Celsus has minutely described his mode of operating (<title>De Med.</title> vii. 26. 3, p. 436), which in some respects resembles that of Civiale and Heurteloup in the early part of the present century, and proves that, however much credit they may deserve for perfecting the operation and bringing it out of oblivion into public notice, the praise of having originally thought of it belongs to the ancients. “A hook or crotchet,” says Celsus, “is fixed upon the stone in such a way as easily to hold it firm, even when shaken, so that it may not revolve backward; then an iron instrument is used, of moderate thickness, thin at the front end, but blunt, which, when applied to the stone and struck at the other end, cleaves it: great care must be taken that the instrument does not come into contact with the bladder itself, and that nothing fall upon it by the breaking of the stone.” The next surgical writer after Hippocrates, whose works are still extant, is Celsus, who lived at the beginning of the first century A.D., and who has devoted the four last books of his work <title>De Medicina</title>, and especially the seventh and eighth, entirely to surgical matter. It plainly appears from reading Celsus that since the time of Hippocrates surgery had made very great progress, and had, indeed, reached a high degree of perfection. We find in him the earliest mention of the use of the ligature for the arrest of hemorrhage from wounded bloodvessels (v. 26. 21, p. 262); and the Celsian mode of amputation was continued down to comparatively modern times (vii. 33, p. 451). He is the first author who gives directions for the operation of lithotomy (<title>De Med.</title> vii. 26. 2, p. 432), and the method described by him (called the <seg lang="la">apparatus minor</seg>, or <title>Celsus's method</title>) continued to be practised till the commencement of the sixteenth century. It was performed at Paris, Bordeaux, and other places in France, upon patients of all ages, even as late as the latter part of the seventeenth century; and a modern author (Allan <title>On Lithotomy</title>, p. 12) recommends it always to be preferred for 
<pb n="331" /><cb />
 boys under fourteen. He describes (vii. 25. 3, p. 428) the operation of <hi rend="italic">infibulatio</hi>, which was so commonly performed by the ancients upon singers, etc., and is often alluded to in classical authors. (See Juv. vi. 73, 379; Seneca, in Lactant. <title>Divin. Instit.</title> i. 16;  <bibl n="Cic. Epigr. 7. 82" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epigr.</title>vii. 82</bibl><bibl n="Cic.

Epigr. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Epigr., 1</bibl>; Tertull. <title>De Corona Mil.</title> 11.) He also describes (vii. 25. 1, p. 427) the operation of circumcision alluded to by St. Paul (1 <bibl n="Plut. Cor. 7. 18" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cor.vii. 18</bibl>). Paulus Aegineta (<title>De Re Med.</title> vi. 53) transcribes from Antyllus a second method of performing the same operation.</p>
 <p>The following description by Celsus of the necessary qualifications of a surgeon deserves to be quoted: “A surgeon,” says he (lib. vii. Praefat.), “ought to be young, or, at any rate, not very old; his hand should be firm and steady, and never shake; he should be able to use his left hand as readily as his right; his eyesight should be clear, and his mind not easily startled; he should be so far subject to pity as to make him desirous of the recovery of his patient, but not so far as to suffer himself to be moved by his cries; he should neither hurry the operation more than the case requires, nor cut less than is necessary, but do everything just as if the other's screams made no impression upon him.”</p>
 <p>Omitting Scribonius Largus, Moschion, and Soranus, the next author of importance is Caelius Aurelianus, who is supposed to have lived about the beginning of the second century A.D., and in whose works there is much surgical matter, but nothing that can be called original. He rejected as absurd the operation of tracheotomy (<title>De Morb. Chron.</title> iii. 4. 39). He mentions a case of ascites that was cured by tapping (ib. iii. 8. 128), and also a person who recovered after being shot through the lungs by an arrow (ib. ii. 12. 144).</p>
 <p>Galen, the most voluminous and at the same time the most valuable medical writer of antiquity, is less celebrated as a surgeon than as an anatomist and physician. He appears to have practised surgery at Pergamus, but upon his removal to Rome (A.D. 165) he entirely confined himself to medicine (<title>De Meth. Med.</title> vi. <seg lang="la">in fine</seg>, tom. x. p. 455). His writings prove, however, that he did not entirely abandon surgery. His Commentaries on the treatise of Hippocrates <title>De Officina Medici</title>, and his treatise <title>De Fasciis</title>, show that he was well versed even in the minor details of the art. He appears also to have been a skilful operator, though no great surgical inventions are attributed to him.</p>
 <p>Antyllus, who lived some time between Galen and Oribasius, is the earliest writer whose directions for performing tracheotomy are still extant, though the operation (as stated above) was proposed by Asclepiades about three hundred years before. Only a few fragments of the writings of Antyllus remain, and among them the following passage is preserved by Paulus Aegineta (<title>De Re Med.</title> vi. 33): “When we proceed to perform this operation, we must cut through some part of the windpipe, below the larynx, about the third or fourth ring; for to divide the whole would be dangerous. This place is commodious, because it is not covered with any flesh, and because it has no vessels situated near the divided part. Therefore, bending the head of the patient backward, so that the windpipe may come more forward to the view, we make a transverse section between <cb /> two of the rings, so that in this case not the cartilage, but the membrane which unites the cartilages together, is divided. If the operator be a little timid, he may first stretch the skin with a hook and divide it; then, proceeding to the windpipe, and separating the vessels, if any are in the way, he may make the incision.”</p>
 <p>This operation appears to have been very seldom, if ever, performed by the ancients upon a human being. Avenzoar tried it upon a goat, and found it might be done without much danger or difficulty; but he says he should not like to be the first person to try it upon a man.</p>
 <p>Oribasius, physician to the emperor Julian (A.D. 361), professes to be merely a compiler; and though there is in his great work, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Συναγωγαὶ Ἰατρικαί</foreign> (<title>Collecta Medicinalia</title>), much surgical matter, there is nothing original. The same may be said of Aëtius and Alexander Trallianus, both of whom lived towards the end of the sixth century A.D. Paulus Aegineta has given up the fifth and sixth books of his work <title>De Re Medica</title> entirely to surgery, and has inserted much useful matter, derived in a great measure from his own observation and experience. Albucasis translated into Arabic great part of these two books as the basis of his work on surgery. Paulus was particularly celebrated for his skill in midwifery and female diseases, and was called on that account, by the Arabians, <title>Al-Kawábelí</title>, “the Accoucheur” (Abulfaraj, <title>Hist. Dynast.</title> p. 181, ed. Pococke). He probably lived towards the end of the seventh century A.D., and is the last of the ancient Greek and Latin medical writers whose surgical works remain. The names of several others are recorded, but they are not of sufficient eminence to require any notice here. For further information on the subject both of medicine and surgery, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmedicina">Medicina;</ref> and for the legal qualifications, social rank, etc., both of physicians and surgeons, among the ancient Greeks and Romans, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmedicus">Medicus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The surgical instruments from which the accompanying engravings (Nos. 1 to 19) are made were found by a physician of St. Petersburg (Dr. Savenko) in 1819, at Pompeii, in the Via Consularis (Strada Consulare), in a house which is supposed to have belonged to a surgeon. They are now preserved in the museum at Portici. The engravings, with an account of them by Dr. Savenko, were originally published in the <title>Revue Médicale</title> for 1821, vol. iii. p. 427, etc. They were afterwards inserted in Froriep's <title>Notizen aus dem Gebiete der Natur- und Heilkunde</title> for 1822, vol. ii. n. 26, p. 57, etc. The accompanying figures are copied from the German work, in which some of them appear to be badly drawn. Their authenticity was at first doubted by Kühn (<title>De Instrumentis Chirurg. Veteribus Cognitis, et nuper Effossis</title>, Leipzig, 1823), who thought they were the same that had been described by Bayardi in his <title>Catal. Antiq. Monument. Herculani Effos.</title> (Nap. 1754, fol., n. 236-294). When, however, his dissertation was afterwards republished (<title>Opusc. Academ. Med. et Philol.</title>, Leipzig, 1827, ii. 309), he acknowledged himself to be completely satisfied on this point, and has given in the tract referred to a learned and ingenious description of the instruments and their supposed uses, from which the following account is chiefly abridged. It will, however, be seen at once that the form of most of them is so simple, and their uses so obvious, that very little explanation is necessary. Altogether 
<pb n="332" /><cb />
 they give a very high idea of both the science and the practice of surgery among the Romans.</p>
 <p>1, 2. Two probes (<seg lang="la">specillum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">μήλη</foreign>) made of iron; the larger six inches long, the smaller four and a half. 3. A cautery (<foreign lang="greek">καυτήριον</foreign>) made of iron, rather more than four inches long. 4, 5. Two lancets (<seg lang="la">scalpellum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">σμίλη</foreign>) made of copper; the former two inches and a half long, the other three inches. It seems doubtful whether they were used for blood-letting or for opening abscesses, etc. 6. A knife, apparently made of copper, the blade of which is two inches and a half long, and in the broadest part one inch in breadth; the back is straight and thick, and the edge much curved; the handle is so short that Savenko thinks it must have been broken. It is uncertain for what particular purpose it was used: Kühn conjectures that (if it be a surgical instrument at all) it may have been made with such a curved edge and such a straight thick back in order that it might be struck with a hammer, and so amputate fingers, toes, etc. 7. Another knife, apparently <figure id="fig.00332">
<head orig="Surgical Instruments.">Surgical Instruments.</head>
</figure> made of copper, the blade of which is of a triangular shape, two inches long, and in the broadest part eight lines in breadth; the back is straight and one line broad, and this breadth continues all the way to the point, which, therefore, is not sharp, but guarded by a sort of button. Kühn thinks it may have been used for enlarging wounds, etc., for which it would be particularly fitted by its blunt point and broad back. 8. A needle, about three inches long, made of iron. 9. An elevator (or instrument for raising depressed portions of the skull), made of iron, five inches long, and very much resembling those made use of at the present day. 10-14. Different kinds of forceps (<seg lang="la">volsellae</seg>). No. 10 has the two sides separated from each other, and is five inches long. No. 11 is also five inches long. No. 12 is three inches and a half long. The sides are narrow at the point of union, and become broader by degrees towards the other end, where, when closed, they would form a kind of arch. It should be noticed that it is furnished with a movable ring, exactly like the tenaculum forceps employed at the present day. No. 13 was used for pulling out hairs by the roots (<foreign lang="greek">τριχολαβίς</foreign>). No. 14 is six inches long, and is bent in the middle. It was probably used for extracting foreign bodies that had stuck in the oesophagus, or gullet, or in the bottom of a wound. 15. A male catheter (<seg lang="la">aenea fistula</seg>), nine inches in length. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00332.2">
<head orig="Surgical Instruments.">Surgical Instruments.</head>
</figure> The shape is remarkable from its having the double curve like the letter S, which is the form that was re-invented in the last century by the celebrated French surgeon J. L. Petit. 16. Probably a female catheter, four inches in length. Celsus describes both male and female catheters (<title>De Med.</title> vii. 26. 1, p. 429). 17. Supposed by Froriep to be an instrument for extracting teeth (<foreign lang="greek">ὀδοντάγρα</foreign>, Pollux, iv. 181); but Kühn, with much more probability, conjectures it to be an instrument used in amputating part of an enlarged uvula, and quotes Celsus (<title>De Med.</title> vii. 12. 3, p. 404), who says that “no method of operating is more convenient than to <figure id="fig.00332.3">
<head orig="Surgical Instruments.">Surgical Instruments.</head>
</figure> take hold of the uvula with the forceps, and then to cut off below it as much as is necessary.” 18, 19. Probably two spatulae. Nos. 20-23 are perhaps the most interesting of all, as showing the means employed by the Romans in the exploration of some of the internal cavities of the body, for the discovery and treatment of disease. They are taken from Bened. Vulpi, <title>Illustraz. di tutti gli Strumenti Chirurgici</title>, etc. <bibl default="NO">(Naples, 1847)</bibl>, <bibl n="Mem.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Mem.4</bibl>, p. 39, etc., where there is a detailed and learned description of them.

<pb n="333" /><cb /> (<foreign lang="greek">διόπτρα</foreign>, Aegin. <bibl n="Paul.  6. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul.vi. 73</bibl>). No. 22 is a dilator ani (<foreign lang="greek">ἑδροδιαστολεύς</foreign>, id. vi. 78); and No. 23, nippers for compressing veins or extracting splintered bones.</p>

<div2 id="crosschlamys" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Chlamys">Chlamys</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χλαμύς</foreign>). A short mantle forming a part of the outer raiment of the Greeks, and of the Romans in imperial times. Its material was usually woollen; and it differed from the <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάτιον</foreign>, the usual <seg lang="la">amictus</seg> of the male sex, in these respects: that it was much smaller; also finer, thinner, more variegated in colour, and more susceptible of ornament. It moreover differed in being oblong instead of square, its length being generally about twice its breadth ( <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Alex.</title>26</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The chlamys came originally from Macedonia and Thessaly, and was the dress of hunters, of travellers, especially on horseback, and of soldiers. It seems to have been part of the usual dress of a Spartan ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 988" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Lys.</title>988</bibl>) and was worn at Athens by the <seg lang="la">ephebi</seg> from about seventeen to twenty years of age (Philemon, p. 367, ed. Meineke).</p>
 <p>The chlamys as worn by youths, by soldiers, and by hunters differed in colour and fineness, according to its purpose, and the age and rank of the wearer. The hunter commonly went out in a mantle of a dull, inconspicuous colour, as best adapted to escape the notice of wild animals ( <bibl n="Poll.  5. 18" default="NO">Poll.v. 18</bibl>). The more ornamental mantles, being designed for women, were tastefully decorated with a border (<seg lang="la">limbus</seg>,  <bibl n="Verg. A. 4. 137" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>iv. 137</bibl>); and those worn by Phoenicians, Trojans, Phrygians, and other Asiatics were also embroidered, or interwoven with gold ( <bibl n="Verg.

 <p>The usual mode of wearing the mantle was to pass one of its shorter sides round the neck, and to fasten it by means of a brooch (<foreign lang="greek">πόρπη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">fibula</seg>), either over the breast, in which case it hung down the back, reaching to the calves of the legs; or over the right shoulder, so as to cover the left arm, as in the well-known example of the Belvedere Apollo. In other instances, it was made to depend gracefully from the left shoulder, of which the bronze Apollo in the British Museum (see righthand figure) presents an example; or it was thrown lightly behind the back, and passed over either one arm or shoulder, or over both (as in left-hand figure); or, lastly, it was laid upon the throat, carried behind the neck, and crossed so as to hang <figure id="fig.00333.2">

In short, the remains of ancient art of every description show in how high a degree the mantle contributed, by its endless diversity of arrangement, to the display of the human form in its greatest beauty. The aptitude of the mantle to be turned in every possible form around the body made it useful even for defence. The hunter used to wrap his chlamys about his left arm when pursuing wild animals, and preparing to fight with them ( <bibl n="Poll.  5. 18" default="NO">Poll.v. 18</bibl>; <title>Cyneg.</title> vi. 17). Alcibiades died fighting with his mantle rolled round his left hand instead of a shield. The annexed illustration exhibits a figure of Poseidon armed with the trident in his right hand, and having a chlamys to protect the left. It is taken from a medal which was struck in commemoration of a naval victory obtained by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and was evidently designed to express his sense of Poseidon's succour in the conflict. When Artemis goes to the chase, as she does not require her mantle for purposes <figure id="fig.00333.3">

 <p>It appears from the bas-reliefs on marble vases that dancers took hold of one another by the chlamys, as the modern Greeks still do by their scarfs or handkerchiefs, instead of taking one another's hands.</p>
 <p>Among the Romans the chlamys came more into use under the emperors. Caligula wore one enriched with gold ( <title>Calig.</title> 19); and Alexander Severus, when in the country, one dyed with scarlet (Lamprid. <title>Al. Sev.</title> 40).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χορηγός</foreign>); in Latin, <hi rend="bold">Chorāgus.</hi> The person who supplied a properly trained chorus.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The maintenance of a <hi rend="italic">choregia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">χορηγία</foreign>) was one of the regularly recurring state burdens (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι</foreign>) at Athens. Originally the chorus consisted of all the inhabitants in the State. With the improvement of the arts of music and dancing, the distinction of spectators and performers arose; it became more a matter of art to sing and dance in the chorus; paid performers were employed; and at last the duties of this branch of worship devolved upon one person, selected by the State to be their representative, who defrayed all the expenses which were incurred on the different occasions. This person was the choregus. It was the duty of the managers of a tribe (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμεληταὶ φυλῆς</foreign>) to which a <hi rend="italic">choregia</hi> had come round, to provide a person to perform the duties of it; and the person appointed by them had to meet the expenses of the chorus in all plays, tragic or comic (<foreign lang="greek">τραγῳδοῖς, κωμῳδοῖς</foreign>) and satirical; and of the lyric choruses of men and boys, the <hi rend="italic">pyrrhichistae</hi>, cyclian dancers, and flute-players (<foreign lang="greek">χορηγεῖν ἀνδράσι</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρικοῖς χοροῖς, παιδικοῖς χοροῖς, πυρριχισταῖς, κυκλίῳ χορῷ αὐληταῖς ἀνδράσιν</foreign>), etc. He had first to collect his chorus, and then to procure a teacher (<foreign lang="greek">χοροδιδάσκαλος</foreign>), whom he paid for instructing the <hi rend="italic">choreutae.</hi> The choregi drew lots for the first choice of teachers; for as their credit depended upon the success of their chorus in the dramatic or lyric contests, it was of great importance to them whose assistance they secured. When the chorus was composed of boys, 
<pb n="335" /><cb />
 the choregus was occasionally allowed to press children for it, in case their parents were refractory. The chorus were generally maintained, during the period of their instruction, at the expense of the choregus, and he had also to provide <figure id="fig.00335">
<head orig="Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.">Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.</head>
</figure> such meat and drink as would contribute to strengthen the voice of the singers. The expenses of the different choruses are given by Lysias as follows: Chorus of men, 20 minae; with the tripod, 50 minae; pyrrhic chorus, 8 minae; pyrrhic chorus of boys, 7 minae; tragic chorus, 30 minae; comic, 16 minae; cyclian chorus, 300 minae. According to Demosthenes, the chorus of flute-players cost a great deal more than the tragic chorus. The choregus who exhibited the best musical or theatrical entertainment received as a prize a tripod, which he had the expense of consecrating, and sometimes he had also to build the monument on which it was placed. There was a whole street at Athens formed by the line of these tripodtemples, and called “The Street of the Tripods.” A well-preserved specimen is the Choragic Monument of one Lysicrates, shown in the illustration. The laws of Solon prescribed forty as the proper age for the choregus, but this law was not long in force. See <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>.

In Plautus (<title>Curc.</title> iv. 1), the choragus delivers a sort of parabasis. Under the Empire the <seg lang="la">procurator summi choragii</seg>, appointed probably by Domitian, was a regular imperial minister, with a great many subordinates, and had charge of the whole supply of decoration, machinery, and costume necessary for the performance of the various shows as well in the amphitheatre as in the theatre. A subdivision of this office was the <seg lang="la">ratio ornamentorum</seg>, which had special reference to the “make-up” of the actors. Under Gordian we find the name had vanished.

<div2 id="crosschorus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Chorus">Chorus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χορός</foreign>). The word <foreign lang="greek">χορός</foreign> in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi> meant a number of persons who performed songs and dances at religious festivals. When the drama at Athens was developed from the dithyrambic choruses, the chorus was retained as the chief element in the Dionysiac festival. With the old dramatists the choral songs and dances much preponderated over the action proper. As the form of the drama developed, the sphere of the chorus was gradually limited, so that it took the comparatively subordinate position which it occupies in the extant tragedies and comedies. The function of the chorus represented by its leader was to act as an ideal public, more or less connected with the <seg lang="la">dramatis personae.</seg> It might consist of old men and women or of maidens. It took an interest in the occurrences of the drama, watched the action with quiet sympathy, and sometimes interfered—if not to act, at least to advise, comfort, exhort, or give warning. At the critical points of the action, it performed long lyrical pieces with suitable action of dance and gesture. In the better times of the drama these songs stood in close connection with the action; but even in Euripides this connection is sometimes loose, and with the later tragedians, after the time of Agathon, the choral performance sank to a mere <hi rend="italic">intermezzo.</hi> The style of the chorus was distinguished from that of the dialogue partly by its complex lyrical form, partly by its language, in which it adopted a mixture of Attic and Doric forms. The proper place of the chorus was on the orchestra, on different parts of which, after a solemn march, it remained until the end of the piece, drawn up, while standing, in a square. During the action it seldom left the orchestra to reappear, and it was quite exceptional for it to appear on the stage. As the performance went on, the chorus would change its place on the orchestra; as the piece required, it would divide into semi-choruses and perform a variety of artistic movements and dances. The name <foreign lang="greek">ἐμμέλεια</foreign> was given to the tragic dance, which, though not lacking in animation, had a solemn and measured character. The comedy had its burlesque and often indecent performance called <foreign lang="greek">κόρδαξ</foreign>; the satyric drama its <foreign lang="greek">Σίκιννις</foreign>, representing the wanton movements of satyrs. The songs of the choruses, too, had their special names. The first ode performed by the entire body was called <foreign lang="greek">πάροδος</foreign>; the pieces intervening between the parts of the play, <foreign lang="greek">στάσιμα</foreign>; the songs of mourning, in which the chorus took part with the actors, <foreign lang="greek">κομμοί</foreign>. The 
<pb n="336" /><cb />
 number of the members (<foreign lang="greek">χορευταί</foreign>) was, in tragedies, originally twelve, and after Sophocles fifteen. This was probably the number allowed in the satyric drama; the chorus in the Old Comedy numbered twenty-four.</p>
 <p>The business of getting the members of the chorus together, paying them, maintaining them during the time of practice, and generally equipping them for performance, was regarded as a <foreign lang="greek">λειτουργία</foreign>, or public service, and devolved on a wealthy private citizen called a <foreign lang="greek">χορηγός</foreign>, to whom it was a matter of considerable trouble and expense. We know from individual instances that the cost of a tragic chorus might run up to thirty minae (about $540), of a comic chorus to sixteen minae (about $265). If victorious, the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> received a crown and a finely wrought tripod. This he either dedicated, with an inscription, to some deity as a memorial of his triumph, or set up on a marble structure built for the purpose in the form of a temple, in a street named the Street of Tripods, from the number of these monuments which were erected there. One of these memorials, put up by a certain Lysicrates in B.C. 335, still remains. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosschoregus">Choregus</ref>.) After the Peloponnesian War, the prosperity of Athens declined so much that it was often difficult to find a sufficient number of <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi> to supply the festivals. The State, therefore, had to take the business upon itself. But many choruses came to an end altogether. This was the case with the comic chorus in the later years of Aristophanes; and the poets of the Middle and New Comedy accordingly dropped the chorus. This explains the fact that there is no proper chorus in the Roman comedy, which is an imitation of the New Comedy of the Greeks. In their tragedies, however, imitated from Greek originals, the Romans retained the chorus, which, as the Roman theatre had no orchestra, was placed on the stage, and as a rule performed between the acts, but sometimes during the performance as well. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdrama">Drama</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi> chorus, in fact, belonged especially to the <seg lang="la">crepidatae</seg>—i. e. the tragedies modelled on and derived from the Greek ones; but it also appears in the national tragedy of the Romans, the <seg lang="la">praetextatae.</seg> Even though Diomedes declares that the Roman comedy had no chorus, yet this is only true generally, for there is an undoubted chorus of fishermen in the <title>Rudens</title> of Plautus. It was probably the whole company of actors (<seg lang="la">caterva, grex</seg>), not a chorus, which said the “Plaudite” with which comedies end. There appear to have been choruses in the <seg lang="la">pantomimus</seg> and in the <hi rend="italic">pyrrhica</hi> of the Empire. There was no fixed number of <hi rend="italic">choreutae.</hi> As that part of the theatre which was the Greek orchestra was given up to the spectators at Rome, the chorus had to occupy the stage (Vitruv. v. 6, 2). The Roman chorus took more part in the action of the drama than did the Greek chorus ( <title>Ars Poet.</title> 193). It was led by a <seg lang="la">magister chori</seg>, who had his place in the middle of the chorus, and so was called <seg lang="la">mesochorus</seg> ( <title>Epist.</title> ii. 14, 6). The musical accompaniment was played by a <seg lang="la">choraules</seg> on a double flute. Between the acts the chorus (probably in tragedy) and the tibicen (in comedy) used to sing or play (Donatus, <title>Arg. ad Andriam</title>); and Horace (<title>Ars Poet.</title> 194) especially urges that the subject of the songs should be pertinent to the action of the drama. The chorus <cb /> was composed of men who were professionals (<seg lang="la">artifices</seg>), and who were for the most part slaves. As the chorus of the Romans sometimes represented women, they must have worn masks. They were probably dressed after the manner of the Greeks, and the dresses appear to have been very splendid, as was the whole production of plays at the end of the Republic and during imperial times —e. g. purple chlamydes were wanted for a chorus of soldiers, as is told in a well-known story of Lucullus ( <title>Epist.</title> i. 6, 40).</p>
 <p>The literature on the subject of the chorus is very extensive. The most important works are: ArnoldB. , art. “Chor” in Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler des klassischen Alterthums</title>, pp. 383-391; Sommerbrodt, <title>Scaenica;</title> Muff, <title>Die chorische Technik des Sophokles;</title> R.

 <p> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ἀγάλματα</foreign>). This term, though resting on no better authority than that of the Scholiast on Aristophanes ( <bibl n="Simon Atheniensis Eq. 1169" default="NO"> <title>Eq.</title>1169</bibl>), is now customarily used to denote those gold and ivory 
<pb n="337" /><cb />
 statues which were the highest attainments of Greek plastic art.</p>
 <p>The use of these costly materials seems to have been originally a development of the early art of wood-carving. The first artists who produced chryselephantine statues were pupils of Dipoenus and Scyllis, the Cretan “Daedalids.” Though we hear of no such works by these masters themselves, they used ivory in conjunction with ebony (Pausan. ii. 22, 5); by gilding the wood, a quite common proceeding, the transition would be made. The appropriateness of the two materials would then suggest the restriction of the ivory to nude parts, of gold to drapery, etc., a core of wood still underlying the whole. Such, probably, were the works of Doryclidas, Theocles, Dontas, and other artists of the earlier portion of the sixth century B.C. We do not hear of many chryselephantine works of importance during the late archaic or transitional period. The construction of colossal figures, such as the Olympian Zeus and the Athené Parthenos of Phidias, or the Argive Heré of Polycletus, can have had little in common with mere wood-carving. For these, of course, a most elaborate internal framework was necessary. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolossus">Colossus</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χρυσένδετα</foreign>). Metal dishes (<seg lang="la">lances</seg>) used by the Romans for serving up food at table.

The derivation of the word and the epithet <seg lang="la">flava</seg> applied to them by Martial render it probable that these dishes were made of silver, and were adorned (probably on the rim) with ornaments in relief, wrought in gold and attached by means of soldering or riveting.

<head orig="Chrysippus">Chrysippus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Χρύσιππος</foreign>). (1) A son of Pelops, carried off by Laius ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.5.6" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.5.6</bibl>). This circumstance became a theme with many ancient writers, and hence the story assumed different shapes, according to the fancy of those who handled it. The death of Chrysippus was also related in different ways. According to the common account, he was slain by Atreus, at the instigation of his step-mother, Hippodamia. (Gonsult Heyne <seg lang="la">ad loc.</seg>).</p>
 <p>(2) A Stoic philosopher of Soli in Cilicia Campestris. He fixed his residence at Athens, and became a disciple of Cleanthes, the successor of Zeno. He was equally distinguished for natural abilities and industry, seldom suffering a day to elapse without writing 500 lines. He wrote several hundred volumes, of which three hundred were on logical subjects, but in all he borrowed largely from others. He maintained, with the Stoics in general, that the world was God, or a universal effusion of his spirit, and that the superior part of this spirit, which consisted in mind and reason, was the common nature of things, containing the whole and every part. Sometimes he speaks of God as the power of fate and the necessary chain of events; sometimes he calls him fire; and sometimes he deifies the fluid parts of nature, as water and air; and again, the earth, sun, moon, and stars, and the universe in which these are comprehended, and even those men who have obtained immortality. He was very fond of the figure <seg lang="la">sorites</seg> in arguing, which is hence called by Persius “the heap of Chrysippus.” His discourses abounded more in curious subtleties and nice distinctions than in solid arguments. In <cb /> disputation, in which he spent the greatest part of his life, he discovered a degree of promptitude and confidence which approached towards audacity. He often said to his preceptor, “Give me doctrines, and I will find arguments to support them.” It was a singular proof of his haughty spirit that when a certain person asked him what preceptor he would advise him to choose for his son, he said, “Me; for if I thought any philosopher excelled me, I would myself become his pupil.” With so much contempt did he look down upon the distinctions of rank that he would never, as other philosophers did, pay his court to princes or great men, by dedicating to them any of his writings. The vehemence and arrogance with which he supported his tenets created him many adversaries, particularly in the Academic and Epicurean sects. Even his friends of the Stoic School complained that, in the warmth of dispute, while he was attempting to load his adversary with the reproach of obscurity and absurdity, his own ingenuity often failed him, and he adopted such unusual and illogical modes of reasoning as gave his opponents great advantages over him. It was also a common practice with Chrysippus, at different times, to take the opposite sides of the same question, and thus furnish his antagonists with weapons which might easily be turned, as occasion offered, against himself. Carneades, who was one of his most able and skilful adversaries, frequently availed himself of this circumstance, and refuted Chrysippus by convicting him of inconsistency. Of his writings (he is said to have published 700 works in all) nothing remains, except a few extracts which are preserved in the works of Cicero, Plutarch, Seneca, and Aulus Gellius. These fragments were collected and edited by Petersen in 1827. He died in the 143d Olympiad, B.C. 208, at the age of eighty-three. A statue was erected to his memory by Ptolemy. See the account in Zeller's <bibl default="NO"><title>Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics</title> (Eng. trans. London, 1870)</bibl>.

 <p>A Greek scholar who is commonly regarded as having been the first to reintroduce Greek literature into Italy, in the fourteenth century. A native of Constantinople, he was sent by the Greek emperor John Palaeologus to Italy and England, in order to seek aid against the Turks. This mission, which was about the year 1390-91, made Chrysoloras known to many influential Italians; so that when, in 1397, he made his home in Florence as a teacher of Greek, he was received with much consideration. Poggio Bracciolini, Leonardo Bruno, Filelfo, Guarino Guarini, and many other scholars whose names are associated with the Renaissance, were pupils of Chrysoloras, who later engaged in the public service under the popes Gregory XII. and John XXIII. By order of the latter, he attended the Council of Constance, where he died, April 15th, 1415. Two of his works have been printed: the <foreign lang="greek">Ἐρωτήματα</foreign>, for some time the only Greek grammar used in Western Europe; and <title>Epistolae III. de Comparatione Veteris et Novae Romae.</title> A number of others, however, still exist in MS.

<div2 id="crosschrysostomus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Chrysostŏmus">Chrysostomus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Χρυσόστομος</foreign>) (St. John). An eminent Father of the Church, born of a noble family at Antioch, A.D. 347. His father's name was Secundus, and the surname of Chrysostom, or “golden mouth,” obtained by the son, was given to him on account of his eloquence. He was bred to the bar, but quitted it for an ascetic life: first, with a monk on a mountain near Antioch, and then in a cave by himself. He remained in this retirement six years, when he returned to Antioch, and, being ordained, became so celebrated for his talents as a preacher that, on the death of Nectarius, patriarch of Constantinople, he was chosen to supply his place. On obtaining this preferment, which he very unwillingly accepted, he acted with great vigour and austerity in the reform of abuses, and exhibited all the mistaken notions of the day in regard to celibacy and the monastic life. He also persecuted the pagans and heretics with great zeal, and sought to extend his episcopal power with such unremitting ardour that he involved himself in a quarrel with Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, who enjoyed the patronage of the empress Eudoxia; which quarrel ended in his formal deposition by a synod held at Chalcedon, A.D. 403. He was, however, so popular in Constantinople that a formidable insurrection ensued, and the empress herself interfered for his return. Towards the end of the same year, owing to his zeal relative to a statue of Eudoxia, placed near the great church, and causing a disturbance of public worship, all his troubles were renewed. If true, that in one of his sermons the empress was compared by him to Herodias, who asked the head of John in a charger, the anger of Eudoxia was not altogether unjustifiable. The consequence of her resentment was the assembling of another synod, and in A.D. 404 the patriarch was again deposed and sent into exile. The place of his banishment was Cucusus, a lonely town among the ridges of Mount Taurus, on the confines of Cappadocia and Cilicia. He sustained himself with much fortitude; but having, by means of his great influence and many adherents, procured the intercession of the Western emperor, Honorius, with his brother Arcadius, he was ordered to be removed still farther from the capital, and died on the journey at Comana in Pontus, A.D. 407, at the age of sixty. Opinion was much divided in regard to his merits for some time after his death, but at length his partisans prevailed, and thirty years from his decease he was removed from his place of interment as a saint, and his remains were met in procession by the emperor Theodosius II., on their removal from the place of his original interment to Constantinople. The Roman Church celebrates St. Chrysostom on the 27th of January; the Greek Church, on the 13th of November.</p>
 <p>Chrysostom was a voluminous writer, but more eloquent than either learned or acute. Although falling short of Attic purity, his style is free, copious, and unaffected, and his diction often glowing <cb /> and elevated. The numerous treatises or sermons by which he chiefly gained his reputation are very curious for the information they contain on the customs and manners of the times, as elicited by his declamation against prevailing vices and follies. The first entire Greek edition of the works of Chrysostom was that of Sir Henry Saville, at Eton, in 8 vols. folio <bibl default="NO">(1613)</bibl>; but that of Montfaucon, Paris, with annotations and his life, 11 vols. folio <bibl default="NO">(1718-38, reprinted by the Abbé Migne, Paris, 1863)</bibl>, is by far the most complete.

<div2 id="crosscicero" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cicĕro">Cicero</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Tullius</hi>. The greatest of the Roman orators. He was born at Arpinum, the native place of Marius, B.C. 106, the same year which gave birth to Pompey the Great. His family was ancient, and of equestrian rank, but had never taken part in public affairs at Rome, though both his father and grandfather were persons of consideration in the part of Italy in which they resided. His father, being a man of cultivated mind, determined to educate his two sons, Marcus and Quintus, on an enlarged and liberal plan, and to fit them for the prospect of those public employments which his own weak state of health incapacitated him from seeking. Marcus, the elder of the two, soon displayed indications of a superior mind, and we are told that his school-fellows carried home such accounts of his extraordinary parts that their parents often visited the school for the sake of seeing a boy who gave so much promise of future eminence. One of his earliest masters was the poet Archias, whom he defended afterwards in his consular year; and under his instruction he attained such proficiency as to compose a poem, though yet a boy, on the fable of Glaucus, which had formed the subject of one of the tragedies of Aeschylus. Soon after he assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>, he was placed under the care of Scaevola, the celebrated lawyer, whom he introduces so beautifully in several of his philosophical dialogues; and in no long time he gained a thorough knowledge of the laws and political institutions of his country. This was about the period of the Social War; and, according to the Roman custom, which made it a necessary part of education to learn military science by actual service, Cicero took the opportunity of serving a campaign under the consul Pompeius Strabo, father of Pompey the Great. Returning to pursuits more congenial to his natural tastes, he commenced the study of philosophy under Philo the Academic. But his chief attention was reserved for oratory, <cb /> to which he applied himself with the assistance of Molo, the ablest rhetorician of the day; while Diodotus the Stoic exercised him in the argumentative subtleties for which the disciples of Zeno were so celebrated. At the same time he declaimed daily in Greek and Latin with certain young noblemen, who were competitors in the same race for honours with himself.</p>
 <p>Cicero was the first Roman who found his way to the highest dignities of the State with no other recommendation than his powers of eloquence and his merits as a civil magistrate. The first case of importance which he undertook was the defence of Roscius Amerinus, in which he distinguished himself by his courageous defence of his client, who had been accused of parricide by Chrysogonus, a favourite of Sulla 's. This obliging him, however, according to Plutarch, to leave Rome from prudential motives, the power of Sulla being at that time paramount, he employed his time in travelling for two years under pretence of his health, which he tells us was as yet unequal to the exertion of pleading. At Athens he met with T. Pomponius Atticus, whom he had formerly known at school, and there renewed with him a friendship which lasted through life, in spite of the change of interests and estrangement of affection so commonly attendant on turbulent times. Here, too, he attended the lectures of Antiochus, who, under the name of an Academic, taught the dogmatic doctrines of Plato and the Stoics. Though Cicero at first evinced considerable dislike for his philosophical views, he seems afterwards to have adopted the sentiments of the Old Academy, which they much resembled, and not until late in life to have relapsed into the sceptical tenets of his earlier instructor Philo. See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilosophia">Philosophia</ref>.</p>
 <p>After visiting the principal philosophers and rhetoricians of Asia, he returned at the age of thirty to Rome, so strengthened and improved both in bodily and mental powers that he soon eclipsed in speaking all his competitors for public favour. Such brilliant gifts speedily gained him the suffrage of the people; and being sent to Sicily as quaestor, at a time when the metropolis itself was visited with a scarcity of corn, he acquitted himself in that delicate situation with so much success as to supply the clamorous wants of the Romans without oppressing the province from which the provisions were raised. Returning thence with greater honours than had ever before been decreed to a Roman governor, he gained for himself still further the esteem of the Sicilians by undertaking his celebrated prosecution of <ref type="cross" target="crossverres">Verres</ref> (q.v.) for his misgovernment of Sicily. Verres, though defended by the influence of the Metelli and the eloquence of <ref type="cross" target="crosshortensius">Hortensius</ref> (q.v.), was driven in despair into voluntary exile. Five years after his quaestorship Cicero was elected aedile. Though possessed of only a moderate fortune, he nevertheless, with the good sense and taste which mark his character, was enabled, while holding this expensive office, to preserve in his domestic arrangements the dignity of a literary and public man, without any of the ostentation of magnificence which often distingnished the candidate for popular applause. After the customary interval of two years, he was returned at the head of the list as praetor, and now made his first appearance on the Rostra in support of the Manilian law. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Lex Manilia</ref>.) About the same time, also, he defended Cluentius. At the expiration of his 
<pb n="340" /><cb />
 praetorship, he refused to accept a foreign province, the usual reward of that magistracy; but, having the consulship in view, and relying on his interest with Caesar and Pompey, he allowed nothing to divert him from that career of glory for which he now believed himself to be destined. Having succeeded at length in attaining to the high office of which he was in quest, he signalized his consulship by crushing the conspiracy of Lucius Catiline; and the Romans hailed him, on the discovery and overthrow of this nefarious plot, as the Father and Deliverer of his country. His consulate was succeeded by the return of Pompey from the East, and the establishment of the First Triumvirate; which, disappointing his hopes of political greatness, induced him to resume his forensic and literary occupations. From these he was called away, after an interval of four years, by the threatening measures of P. Clodius (q. v.), who at length succeeded in driving him into exile. This event, which, considering the circumstances connected with it, was one of the most glorious of his life, filled him with the utmost distress and despondency. Its history is as follows: Clodius, Cicero's bitter enemy, had caused a law to be renewed, declaring every one guilty of treason who ordered the execution of a Roman citizen before the people had condemned him. The blow was aimed against Cicero, on account of the punishment he had caused to be inflicted, by the authority of the Senate, upon the accomplices of Catiline. The illustrious exconsul put on mourning, and appeared in public, accompanied by the equites and many young patricians, demanding the protection of the people. Clodius, however, at the head of his armed adherents, insulted them repeatedly, and ventured even to besiege the Senate-house. Cicero, upon this, went into voluntary exile. His conduct, however, in this reverse of fortune, showed anything but the firmness of a man of fortitude. He wandered about Greece, bewailing his miserable condition, refusing the consolations which his friends attempted to administer, and shunning the public honours with which the Greek cities were eager to load him. He ultimately took refuge in Thessalonica with Plancus. Clodius, in the meantime, procured new decrees, in consequence of which Cicero's country-seats were torn down, and a temple of Libertas built on the site of his house at Rome. His wife and children were also exposed to ill-usage from his embittered persecutors. A favourable change, however, soon took place in the minds of his countrymen. The insolence of Clodius became insupportable to all. Pompey encouraged Cicero's friends to get him recalled to Rome, and the Senate also declared that it would not attend to any business until the decree which ordered his banishment was revoked. Through the zeal of the consul Lentulus, and at the proposition of several tribunes, the decree of recall passed the assembly of the people in the following year, in spite of a bloody tumult, in which Cicero's brother Quintus was dangerously wounded; and the orator returning to his native country after an absence of ten months, was received with every mark of honour. The Senate met him at the city gates, and his entry resembled a triumphal procession. The attacks of Clodius, though they could now do little harm, were immediately renewed, until Cicero was freed from the insults of this turbulent demagogue by the hand of Milo, whom he afterwards, in a public <cb /> trial for the deed, unsuccessfully defended. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmilo">Milo</ref>.) Five years after his return from exile he received the government of Cilicia, in consequence of Pompey's law, which obliged those senators of consular or praetorian rank, who had never held any foreign command, to divide the vacant provinces among them. Cicero conducted a war, while <figure id="fig.00340">
<head orig="Cicero. (Capitoline Museum.)">Cicero. (Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> in this office, with good success against the plundering tribes of the mountain districts of Cilicia, and was greeted by his soldiers with the title of Imperator. He resigned his command, and returned to Italy about the close of the year 50, intending to prefer his claim to a triumph; but the troubles which were just then commencing between Caesar and Pompey prevented him from obtaining one. His return home was followed by earnest endeavours to reconcile Pompey with Caesar, and by very spirited behaviour when Caesar required his presence in the Senate. But this independent temper was only transient; and at no period of his public life did he display such miserable vacillation as at the opening of the Civil War. His conduct, in this respect, had been faulty enough before, for he then vacillated between the several members of the First Triumvirate, defending Vatinius in order to please Caesar, and his bitter political enemy Gabinius to ingratiate himself with Pompey. Now, however, we find him first accepting a commission from the Republic; then courting Caesar; next, on Pompey's sailing for Greece, resolving to follow him thither; presently determining to stand neutral; then bent on retiring to the Pompeians in Sicily; and when finally he had joined their camp in Greece, exhibiting such timidity and discontent as to draw from Pompey the bitter remark, <title>Cupio ad hostes Cicero transeat, ut nos timeat</title> (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 3</bibl>).</p>
 <p>After the battle of Pharsalia (B.C. 48) and the flight of Pompey, he refused to take the command of some troops then under the orders of Cato , but returned to Italy, which was governed by Antony, the representative of Caesar. His return was attended with several unpleasant circumstances, until the 
<pb n="341" /><cb />
 conqueror wrote to him, and soon after received him in the most friendly spirit. Cicero now devoted himself entirely to literature and philosophy. The state of his private affairs, however, involved him in great embarrassment. A large sum, which he had advanced to Pompey, had impoverished him, and he was forced to stand indebted to Atticus for present assistance. These difficulties led him to a step which it has been customary to regard with great severity—the divorce of his wife Terentia, though he was then in his sixty-second year, and his marriage with his rich ward Publilia, who was of an age disproportionate to his own. Yet, in reviewing this proceeding, we must not adopt the modern standard of propriety, forgetful of the character of an age which reconciled actions even of moral turpitude with a reputation for honour and virtue. Terentia was a woman of a most imperious and violent temper, and had, besides, in no slight degree contributed to his present embarrassment by her extravagance in the management of his private affairs. By her he had had two children—a son born the year before his consulship, and a daughter, whose loss he was now fated to experience. To Tullia he was tenderly attached, not only from the excellence of her disposition, but from her love of polite literature; and her death now took from him, as he so pathetically laments to Sulpicius, the only comfort which the course of public events had left him. His distress was increased by the unfeeling conduct of Publilia, whom he soon divorced for testifying joy at the death of her step-daughter. It was on this occasion that he wrote the treatise <title>De Consolatione</title>, with a view to mitigate the anguish of his sufferings. His friends were assiduous in their attentions; and Caesar, who had treated him with the utmost kindness on his return from Egypt, signified the respect he bore his character by sending a letter of condolence from Spain, where the remains of the Pompeian party still engaged him. But no attentions, however considerate, could soften Cicero's vexation at seeing the country he had formerly saved by his exertions now subjected to the dominion of a single master. His speeches, indeed, for Marcellus and Ligarius exhibit traces of inconsistency; but for the most part he retired from public business, and gave himself up to the composition of those works which, while they mitigated his political sorrows, have secured his literary fame.</p>
 <p>The assassination of Caesar, which took place in the following year (B.C. 44), once more brought him on the stage of public affairs. He hoped to regain great political influence; but Antony took Caesar's place, and all that was left Cicero to do was to compose those vigorous orations against him which are known by the name of Philippics, and are equally distinguished for eloquence and patriotism. His enmity towards Antony induced him to favour the young Octavianus, although the pretended moderation of the latter by no means deceived him. With him originated all the energetic resolutions of the Senate in favour of the war which the consuls and the young Caesar were conducting against Antony in the name of the Republic; and for a time the prospect seemed to brighten. At last, however, Octavianus having possessed himself of the consulship, and having formed the alliance with Antony and Lepidus known as the Second Triumvirate, Cicero became convinced that liberty was at an end. At Tusculum, whither he <cb /> had retired with his brother and his nephew, he learned that Octavianus had basely deserted him, and that his name, at Antony's demand, had been added to the list of the proscribed. He repaired, in a state of indecision, to the sea-coast and embarked. Contrary winds, however, drove him back to the shore. At the request of his slaves he embarked a second time, but soon returned again to await his fate at his country-seat near Formiae. “I will die,” said he, “in that country which I have so often saved.” Here, then, he was disposed to remain and to meet his death; but his slaves, who were warmly attached to him, could not bear to see him thus sacrificed; and when the party of soldiers sent to murder him was advancing towards the villa, they almost used force to make him enter his litter, and to allow them to carry him once more on board of the vessel, which was still lying at Caieta. But, as they were bearing the litter towards the sea, they were overtaken in the walks of his own grounds by the soldiers who were in search of him, and who were headed by one Herennius, a centurion, and by C. Popilius Laenas. Popilius was a native of Picenum, and had, on a former occasion, been successfully defended by Cicero, when brought to trial for some offence before the courts at Rome. As the assistance of advocates was given gratuitously, the connection between them and their clients was esteemed very differently from what it is among us; and it was therefore an instance of peculiar atrocity that Popilius offered his services to Antony to murder his patron, from no other motive than the hope of gaining his favour by showing such readiness to destroy his greatest enemy. The slaves of Cicero, undismayed at the appearance of the soldiers, prepared to defend their master; but he refused to allow any blood to be shed on his account, and commanded them to set down the litter and await the issue in silence. He was obeyed; and when the soldiers came up he stretched out his head with perfect calmness, and submitted his neck to the sword of Popilius. He died in his sixty-third year, B.C. 43. When the murder was accomplished the soldiers cut off his two hands also, as the instruments with which he had written his Philippic orations; and the head and hands were carried to Rome, and exposed together at the Rostra. Men crowded to see the mournful sight, and testified by their tears the compassion and affection which his unworthy death, and his pure and amiable character, had so justly deserved.</p>
 <p>On the whole, antiquity may be challenged to produce an individual so upright and so amiable as Cicero. None interest us more in their lives; none excite more painful emotions in their deaths. Others may be found of loftier and more heroic character, who awe and subdue the mind by the grandeur of their views or the intensity of their exertions; but Cicero wins our affections by the integrity of his public conduct, the purity of his private life, the generosity, placability, and kindness of his heart, the playfulness of his temper, and the warmth of his domestic attachments. In this respect his letters are invaluable. Here we see the man without disguise or affectation, especially in his letters to Atticus, to whom he unbosomed every thought, and talked with the same frankness as to himself. It must, however, be confessed that the publication of this same correspondence has laid open the defects of his political 
<pb n="342" /><cb />
 character. Everything seemed to point out Cicero as the fittest person of the day to be a mediator between contending factions. And yet, after the eventful period of his consulship, we see him resigning the high station in the Republic which he himself might have filled, to the younger Cato , who, with only half his abilities, little foresight, and no address, possessed that first requisite for a statesman, firmness. Cicero, on the contrary, was irresolute, timid, and inconsistent. He talked, indeed, largely of preserving a middle course, but he was continually vacillating from one to the other extreme; always too confident or too dejected; incorrigibly vain of success, yet meanly panegyrizing the government of a usurper. His foresight, sagacity, practical good sense, and singular tact in directing men's measures, were lost for want of that strength of mind which points them steadily to one object. He was never decided, and never took an important step without afterwards repenting of it. Nor can we account for the firmness and resolution of his consulate, unless we discriminate between the ease of resisting a party and that of balancing contending interests.</p>
 <p>We may now consider Cicero as a public speaker and writer. The <hi rend="SmallCaps">orations</hi> that he is known to have composed amount in all to 107, of which seventyseven, either entire or in part, have been preserved. All those pronounced by him during the five years intervening between his election to the quaestorship and the aedileship have perished, except that for M. Tullius, the <seg lang="la">exordium</seg> and <seg lang="la">narratio</seg> of which were brought to light by the discoveries of Mai in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. From the same quarter have been obtained many other proofs of the eloquence of Cicero, among the most important of which are a large fragment of the oration for Scaurus, and detached portions of that delivered against Clodius for his profanation of the mysteries of the Bona Dea. Of all the lost orations, the two most regretted are that in defence of Cornelius, and the speech delivered by him in the Temple of Bellona in quelling the disturbance excited by the law of Otho. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslex">Roscia Lex</ref>.) This last is said to have been one of the most signal victories of eloquence over the turbulence of human passions, while to the former Cicero himself frequently alludes as among the most finished of his compositions. The oration for Marcellus is maintained by many to be a spurious performance. It would seem, however, after weighing all the arguments adduced by modern critics, that a part is actually genuine, but that much has been subsequently interpolated by some rhetorician or declaimer.</p>
 <p>Of the <hi rend="SmallCaps">rhetorical works</hi> of Cicero, the most admired and finished is the dialogue <title>De Oratore</title>, of which Cicero himself highly approved, and which his friends were accustomed to regard as one of the finest of his productions. In the <title>Oratoriae Partitiones</title>, the subject is the art of arranging and distributing the parts of an oration so as to adapt them in the best manner to their proper end—that of moving and persuading an audience. In the dialogue on famous orators, entitled <title>Brutus</title>, he gives a short description of all who had ever flourished in Greece or Rome, with any considerable reputation for eloquence, down to his own time. It was intended as a fourth and supplemental book to the treatise <title>De Oratore.</title> The <title>Orator</title>, addressed to Brutus, and written at his <cb /> solicitation, was intended to complete the two works just mentioned. It enlarges on the favourite topic of Cicero, which had already been partially discussed in the treatise <title>De Oratore</title>—the character of the perfect orator; and seeks to confirm his favourite proposition—that perfection in oratory requires an extensive acquaintance with every art. It is on the merits of this work in particular that Cicero, in a letter to a friend, asserts his perfect willingness that his reputation should be staked. The <title>Topica</title> is a compendium of the <title>Topica</title> of Aristotle. The treatise <title>De Optimo Genere Oratorum</title> was originally intended as a preface to a translation of the celebrated orations of Demosthenes and Aeschines <title>De Corona.</title> The work <title>De Inventione</title> was a youthful performance; and that addressed to Herennius, according to the best authorities, never proceeded from his pen. In all Cicero's rhetorical works, except, perhaps, the <title>Orator</title>, he professes to have digested the principles of the Aristotelian and Isocratic schools into one finished system, selecting what was best in each, and, as occasion might offer, adding remarks and precepts of his own. The subject is considered in three distinct lights, with reference to (1) the case,</p>
 <p>(2) the speaker, and</p>
 <p>(3) the speech. The case, as respects its nature, is definite or indefinite; with reference to the hearer, it is judicial, deliberative, or descriptive; as regards the opponent, the division is fourfold—according as the fact, its nature, its quality, or its propriety is called in question. The art of the speaker is directed to five points: the sources of persuasion (whether ethical, pathetic, or argumentative), arrangement, diction, memory, delivery. And the speech itself consists of six parts: introduction (or exordium), statement of the case, division of the subject, proof, refutation, and conclusion or peroration. Cicero's laudatory orations are among his happiest efforts. Nothing can exceed the taste and beauty of those for the Manilian law, for Marcellus, for Ligarius, for Archias, and the Ninth Philippic, which is principally in praise of Servius Sulpicius. But it is in judicial eloquence, particularly on subjects of a lively cast, as in his speeches for Caelius and Muraena and against Caecilius, that his talents are displayed to the best advantage. To both kinds his urbane and pleasant cast of mind imparts inexpressible grace and delicacy; historical allusions, philosophical sentiments, descriptions full of life and nature, and polite raillery, succeed each other in the most agreeable manner, without appearance of artifice or effort. Of this nature are his pictures of the confusion of the Catilinarian conspirators on detection ( <bibl n="Ammon. in Cat. 3. 3" default="NO"> <title>In Cat.</title>iii. 3</bibl>); of the death of Metellus (<bibl n="Cic. Cael. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Pro Cael.</title> 10</bibl>); of Sulpicius undertaking the embassy to Antony (<title>Philipp.</title> ix. 3); the character he draws of Catiline (<bibl n="Cic. Cael. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Pro Cael.</title> 6</bibl>); and his fine sketch of old Appius frowning on his degenerate descendant Clodia (<bibl n="Cic. Cael. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">ib. 6</bibl>). But, by the formation of a style which adapts itself with singular felicity to every class of subjects, whether lofty or familiar, philosophical or forensic, Cicero answers more exactly to his own definition of a perfect orator ( <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 29" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orat.</title>29</bibl>) than by his plausibility, pathos, and vivacity. Among many excellences possessed by Cicero's oratorical diction, the greatest is its suitability to the genius of the Latin language; though the diffuseness thence necessarily resulting has exposed it, both in his own days and since his time, 
<pb n="343" /><cb />
 to the criticisms of those who have affected to condemn its Asiatic character, in comparison with the simplicity of Attic writers and the strength of Demosthenes. Greek, however, is celebrated for copiousness in its vocabulary and perspicuity in its phrases, and its consequent facility of expressing the most novel or abstruse ideas with precision and elegance. Hence the Attic style of eloquence was plain and simple, because simplicity and plainness were not incompatible with clearness, energy, and harmony. But it was a singular want of judgment, an ignorance of the very principles of composition, which induced Brutus, Calvus, Sallust, and others, to imitate this terse and severe beauty in their own defective language, and even to pronounce the opposite kind of diction deficient in taste and purity. In Greek, indeed, the words fall, as it were, naturally into a distinct and harmonious order; and, from the exuberant richness of the materials, less is left to the ingenuity of the artist. But the Latin language is comparatively weak, scanty, and unmusical, and requires considerable skill and management to render it expressive and graceful. Simplicity in Latin is scarcely separable from baldness; and justly as Terence is celebrated for chaste and unadorned diction, yet even he, compared with Attic writers, is flat and heavy. Again, the perfection of strength is clearness united to brevity; and to this combination Latin is usually unequal. From the vagueness and uncertainty of meaning which characterize its separate words, to be perspicuous it must be full. What Livy and, much more Tacitus, have gained in energy, they have lost in perspicuity and elegance. Latin, in short, is not a philosophical language; not a language in which a deep thinker is likely to express himself with purity or neatness. Now Cicero rather made a language than a style, yet not so much by the invention as by the combination of words. Some terms, indeed, his philosophical subjects compelled him to coin, and these are often admirable—e. g. <seg lang="la">qualitas, quantitas</seg>=<foreign lang="greek">ποιότης, ποσότης</foreign>; but his great art lies in the application of existing materials, in converting the very disadvantages of the language into beauties, in enriching it with circumlocutions and metaphors, in pruning it of harsh and uncouth expressions, and in systematizing the structure of a sentence. This is that <seg lang="la">copia dicendi</seg> which gained Cicero the high testimony of Caesar to his inventive powers, and which makes him the greatest master of composition the world has ever seen.</p>
 <p>We come next to Cicero's <hi rend="SmallCaps">philosophical writings</hi>, after a brief enumeration of which we shall offer a few remarks on the character of his philosophy itself. The treatise <title>De Legibus</title> has reached us in an imperfect state, only three books remaining, and these disfigured by numerous chasms that cannot be supplied. It traces the philosophic principles of jurisprudence to their remotest sources, sets forth a body of laws conformable to Cicero's idea of a well-regulated State, and is supposed to have treated in the books that are lost of the executive power of magistrates and the rights of Roman citizens. The treatise <title>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</title> is written after the manner of Aristotle, and discusses the chief good and the chief evil (<seg lang="la">summum bonum et summum malum</seg>); in it Cicero explains the several opinions entertained on this subject by the philosophers of antiquity. The <title>Academicae Quaestiones</title> relates <cb /> to the Academic philosophy, whose tenets Cicero himself had embraced. It is an account and defence of the doctrines of the Academy. In the <title>Tusculanae Disputationes</title>, five books are devoted to as many different questions of philosophy, bearing the most strongly on the practice of life, and involving topics the most essential to human happiness. The <title>Paradoxa</title> contains a defence of six paradoxes of the Stoics. The work <title>De Natura Deorum</title>, in three books, embraces a full examination of the various theories of heathen antiquity on the nature of the gods, to which the treatise <title>De Divinatione</title> may be regarded as a supplement. The essay <title>De Officiis</title>, on moral duties, has, not unaptly, been styled the heathen Whole Duty of Man; nor have the dialogues <title>De Senectute</title> and <title>De Amicitia</title> been incorrectly regarded as among the most highly finished and pleasing performances of which any language can boast. We have to lament the loss of the treatises <title>De Consolatione, De Gloria</title>, and the one entitled <title>Hortensius</title>, in which last Cicero undertook the defence of learning and philosophy, and left to his illustrious competitor the task of arraigning them. It was this book which first led St. Augustine to the study of Christian philosophy and the doctrines of Christianity. The treatise <title>De Republica</title> has been in part rescued from the destroying hand of time by the labours of Mai. Except the works <title>De Inventione</title> and <title>De Oratore</title>, this was the earliest of Cicero's literary productions. It was given to the world in B.C. 53, just before its author set out for his proconsular government in Cilicia. He was then in his fifty-third year. The object and spirit of the work were highly patriotic. He wished to bring the constitution back to its first principles by an impression expositive of its theory; to inflame his contemporaries with the love of virtue by pourtraying the character of their ancestors in its primeval purity and beauty; and while he was raising a monument to all future ages of what Rome had been, to inculcate upon his own times what it ought still to be. We know it to have been his original purpose to make it a very voluminous work; for he expressly tells his brother that it was to be extended to nine books. Ernesti thinks that they were all given to the world, although Cicero, in a letter to Atticus, on which that learned and suggestive scholar makes this very remark, speaks of them as his <hi rend="italic">six</hi> pledges or sureties for his good behaviour.</p>
 <p>Cicero, as a philosopher, belongs, upon the whole, to the New Academy. It has been disputed whether he was really attached to this system, or had merely resorted to it as being the best adapted for furnishing him with oratorical arguments suited to all occasions. At first its adoption was subsidiary to his other plans. But, towards the conclusion of his life, when he no longer maintained the place he was wont to hold in the Senate or the Forum, and when philosophy formed the occupation “with which,” to quote his own words, “life was just tolerable, and without which it would have been intolerable,” he doubtless became convinced that the principles of the New Academy, illustrated as they had been by <ref type="cross" target="crosscarneades">Carneades</ref> (q.v.) and Philo , formed the soundest system which had descended to mankind from the schools of Athens. The attachment, however, of Cicero to the Academic philosophy was free from the exclusive spirit of sectarianism, and hence it did not 
<pb n="344" /><cb />
 prevent his extracting from other systems what he found in them conformable to virtue and reason. His ethical principles, in particular, appear eclectic, having been in a great measure formed from the opinions of the Stoics. Of most of the Greek sects he speaks with respect and esteem. For the Epicureans alone he seems, notwithstanding his friendship for Atticus, to have entertained a decided aversion and contempt. The general purpose of Cicero's philosophical works was rather to give a history of the ancient philosophy, than dogmatically to inculcate opinions of his own. It was his great aim to explain to his fellow-citizens, in their own language, whatever the sages of Greece had taught on the most important subjects, in order to enlarge their minds and reform their morals.</p>
 <p>In theoretical investigation, in the development of abstract ideas, and in the analysis of qualities and perceptions, Cicero can not be regarded as in any degree an inventor or a profound original thinker, and can not be ranked with Plato and Aristotle. His peculiar merit as a philosophical writer lay in his luminous and popular exposition of the leading principles and disputes of the ancient schools, and no works transmitted from antiquity present so concise and comprehensive a view of the opinions of the Greek philosophers. The most obvious peculiarity of Cicero's philosophical writings is their form of dialogue. The idea was borrowed from Plato and Xenophon; but the nature of Cicero's dialogue is as different from that of the two Athenians as was his object in writing. With them, the Socratic mode of argument could hardly be displayed in any other shape; whereas Cicero's aim was to excite interest, and he availed himself of this mode of composition for the life and variety, the ease, perspicuity, and vigour which it gave to his discussions. The majesty and splendour of his introductions, the eloquence with which both sides of a question are successively displayed, the clearness and terseness of his statements on abstract points, his exquisite allusions to the scene or time of the supposed conversation, his digressions in praise of philosophy, and, lastly, the melody and richness of his style, unite to throw a charm around these productions which has been felt in every age.</p>
 <p>Cicero's <hi rend="SmallCaps">epistulae</hi>, nearly one thousand (864) in all, are comprised in thirty-six books, sixteen of which are addressed to Atticus, three to his brother Quintus, one to Brutus, and sixteen to his different friends; and they form a history of his life from his fortieth year. Among those addressed to his friends (<title>Ad Familiares</title>) some occur written to him by Brutus, Metellus, Plancus, Caelius, and others. For the preservation of this most valuable department of Cicero's writings we are indebted to Tiro , the author's freedman, though we possess at the present day only a part of those originally published. The most interesting by far are the letters to Atticus, for they not only throw great light on the history of the times, but also give us a full insight into the private character of Cicero himself, who was accustomed at all times to unbosom his thoughts most freely to this friend of his. The authenticity of the correspondence with Brutus has been disputed by modern scholars, but the general opinion is favourable to the genuineness of all but two (xvi. and xvii.).</p>
 <p>His <hi rend="SmallCaps">poetical</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">historical works</hi> have suffered a hard fate. The latter class, consisting <cb /> of his commentary on his consulship and his history of his own times, are altogether lost. Of the former, which comprised the heroic poems <title>Alcyone, Marius</title>, and on his own consulate, translations of parts of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Aratus, epigrams, etc., but little remains except some fragments of the <title>Phaenomena</title> and <title>Diosemeia</title> of Aratus. It may, however, be questioned whether literature has suffered much by this loss. We should refrain from speaking contemptuously of the poetic powers of one who possessed so much fancy, so much taste, and so fine an ear; but his poems were principally composed in his youth; and afterwards, when his powers were more mature, his occupations did not allow even his active mind the time necessary for polishing a language then still more rugged in verse than it was in prose. Hence we find that his own contemporaries criticised unfavourably his attempts in verse, a fact to which he himself bears witness; and such specimens as remain show the ante-classical fondness for alliterative jingle; as, for instance, the famous line which he quotes in his <title>De Officiis</title> (i. 77): <lb />“Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudi,”</p>
 <p>and the absurdly egotistical hexameter sneered at by Juvenal in his Tenth Satire: <lb />“O fortunatam natam me consule Roman!”</p>
 <p>His contemporary history, on the other hand, can hardly have conveyed more explicit, and certainly would have contained less faithful, information than his private correspondence; while, with all the penetration he assuredly possessed, it may be doubted if his diffuse and graceful style of thought and composition was adapted for the depth of reflection and condensation of meaning which are the chief excellences of historical composition.</p>
 <p><ref type="cross" target="crossmanuscripts">Manuscripts</ref>.—The MSS. of Cicero are so numerous and so scattered over Europe as to preclude an exhaustive enumeration of them here. The Laurentian Library alone contains 188 codices, of which the oldest dates back to the tenth century. The Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris possesses 231, collected prior to the Revolution of 1789. Six of these date from the ninth century; 138 are of the fifteenth. The oldest collection of the letters <seg lang="la">ad familiares</seg> is the Codex Vercellensis (now the Codex Mediceus) of the ninth century. Petrarch, in 1345, discovered at Verona the letters to Brutus, Q. Cicero, and Atticus. The MS. found by Petrarch has again been lost, so that only a copy of it remains. Other important Ciceronian MSS. are as follows: of the fourteen Philippics, the Vatican-Basilican MS. of the ninth century; of the orations against Verres, the Vatican palimpsest of the fourth (?) century, and two Wolfenbüttel MSS. dependent upon a Paris codex of the ninth century; of the Catilinarian orations, the Ambrosian Codex of the tenth century, and the Munich MSS. of the eleventh century; of the oration for Archias, the Codex Bruxellensis (Brussels) of the eleventh century; of the oration on the Manilian law, the Codex Erfurtensis of the twelfth century; of the oration for Milo, the Munich MS. (18,787) and a palimpsest at Turin; of the treatises <title>De Oratore, Brutus</title>, and <title>Orator</title>, the Codex Laudensis (Lodi), or rather three copies of that codex made after 1422; of the <title>Partitiones Oratoriae</title>, a Paris MS. of the eleventh century (No. 7231); of the <title>Topica</title>, a codex at Leyden and two at St. Gall; of the treatise <title>De Optimo Genere Oratorum</title>, a MS. at St. Gall; of the philosophical 
<pb n="345" /><cb /> works, the Codices Leidenses (Vossiani, 84 saec. x., and 86 saec. xi.), the Codex Laurentianus S. Marci (257) of the tenth century, and the Codex Vindobonensis (Vienna) of the tenth century. A collection of 600 excerpts from Cicero's philosophical writings, made by a certain Hadoardus in the ninth century, is in the Vatican. For the treatise <title>De Legibus</title>, the best MSS. are the Leyden codices (Vossiani, 84 saec. x., and 86 saec. xi.); for the <title>Paradoxa</title>, the same; for the <title>De Finibus</title>, the Palatino-Vaticanus of the eleventh century; for the <title>Academica</title>, the Codices Leidenses already mentioned; for the <title>Tusculanae Disputationes</title>, a MS. at Paris dating from the tenth century, and one at Brussels of the twelfth century; for the <title>Timaeus</title>, the Codices Leidenses; for the <title>De Natura Deorum</title>, the same; for the <title>Cato Maior</title>, a Codex Leidensis (Voss.

After the battle of Philippi he retired to Sicily and joined the younger Pompey. Subsequently, however, he took advantage of the act of amnesty that was passed, and returned to Italy, where he lived for some time in a private capacity. Augustus, on attaining to sovereign power, made him his colleague in the consulship, and it was to Marcus Cicero, in his quality of consul, that he wrote an account of the victory at Actium and the conquest of Egypt. Marcus had the satisfaction of executing the decree which ordered all the statues and monuments that had been erected to Antony to be thrown down. After his consulship he was appointed governor of Syria, from which period history is silent respecting him. He died at an advanced age, and was notorious for dissipated and intemperate habits.

After the battle of Pharsalia, in which he took part on the side of Pompey, he was proscribed by the triumvirate and put to death by the emissaries of Antony. He had a marked talent for poetry, and had planned a poem on the invasion of Britain by Caesar.

<head orig="Cilicia">Cilicia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κιλικία</foreign>). A district in the southeast of Asia Minor, bounded by the Mediterranean on the south, Mount Amanus on the east, and Mount Taurus on the north. The western part of Cilicia is intersected by the offshoots of the Taurus, while in its eastern part the mountain chains inclose much larger tracts of level country; and hence arose the division of the country into Cilicia Aspera or Trachea, and Cilicia Campestris—the latter being also called Cilicia Propria. The first inhabitants of the country are supposed to have been of the Syrian race. The mythical story derived their name from Cilix, the son of Agenor, who started with his brothers, Cadmus and Phoenix, for Europe, but stopped short on the coast of Asia Minor, and peopled with his followers the plain of Cilicia. The country remained independent till the time of the Persian Empire, under which it formed a satrapy, but it appears to have been still governed by its native princes. Alexander subdued it on his march into Upper Asia, and after the division of his empire it formed a part of the kingdom of the Seleucidae. Its plains were settled by Greeks, and the old inhabitants were for the most part driven back into the mountains of Cilicia Aspera, where they remained virtually independent, practicing robbery by land and piracy by sea, till Pompey drove them from the sea in his war against the pirates; and, having rescued the level country from the power of Tigranes, who had overrun it, he erected it into a Roman province, B.C. 67-66. The mountain country was not made a province till the reign of Vespasian. The Cilicians bore a low character among the Greeks and Romans; so that the Carians (<foreign lang="greek">Κᾶρες</foreign>), Cappadocians (<foreign lang="greek">Καππάδοκες</foreign>), and Cilicians (<foreign lang="greek">Κίλικες</foreign>) were called the “three bad K's” (<foreign lang="greek">τρία κάππα κάκιστα</foreign>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δέρρις</foreign>). A haircloth. The material of which the Greeks and Romans almost universally made this kind of cloth was the hair of goats. The Asiatics made it of camel's-hair. Goats were bred for this purpose in Cilicia; and from this country the Latin name of the cloth was derived. Lycia, Phrygia, Spain, and Libya also produced the same article. The cloth obtained by spinning and weaving goat's-hair was nearly black, and was used for the coarse dress which sailors and fishermen wore, as it was the least likely to be destroyed by being wet; also for horse-cloths, tents, sacks, and bags to hold workmen's tools (<seg lang="la">fabrilia vasa</seg>), and for the purpose of covering military engines, and the walls and towers of besieged cities, so as to deaden the force of the ram (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaries">Aries</ref>), and to preserve the woodwork from being set on fire.</p>
 <p>Among the Orientals, sackcloth, which was with them always haircloth, was worn to express mortification and grief. After the decline of the Roman <cb /> power, it passed from its other uses to be so employed in Europe also. Monks and anchorites almost universally adopted the cilicium as fit to be worn for the sake of humiliation, and they supposed their end to be more completely attained if this part of their raiment was never washed.

They defeated several Roman armies, and caused the greatest alarm at Rome. In B.C. 113, they routed the consul Papirius Carbo near Noreia, and then crossed over into Gaul, which they ravaged in all directions. In 109, they defeated the consul Iunius Silanus; and in 107, the consul Cassius Longinus, who fell in the battle; and in 105, they gained their most brilliant victory, near the Rhone, over the united armies of the consul Cn. Mallius and the proconsul Servilius Caepio. Instead of crossing the Alps, the Cimbri, fortunately for Rome, marched into Spain, where they remained two or three years. The Romans, meantime, had been making preparations to resist their formidable foes, and had placed their troops under the command of Marius. The barbarians returned to Gaul in 102. In that year the Teutones were defeated and cut to pieces by Marius near Aquae Sextiae (Aix) in Gaul; and next year (101) the Cimbri and their allies were likewise destroyed by Marius and Catulus, in the decisive battle of the Campi Raudii, near Verona, in the north of Italy.

<div2 id="crosscimon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cimon">Cimon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κίμων</foreign>). (1) The son of Miltiades and of Hegesipylé, the daughter of Olorus, a Thracian prince. His education, according to Plutarch, was very much neglected, and he himself indulged, at first, in every species of excess. At his father's death he seems to have succeeded to a very scanty fortune, and he would perhaps have found it very difficult to pay the fine of fity talents which had been imposed upon his parent, and which the son was bound to pay to the public treasury, had not Callias, one of the wealthiest men of Athens, struck by the charms of his half-sister Elpinicé, undertaken to discharge the sum as the price of her hand. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosselpinice">Elpinicé</ref>.) Cimon, however, had attracted notice and gained reputation by the spirit which he displayed on the occasion of leaving the city on the approach of the Persians, when he was the foremost to hang up a bridle in the Acropolis, as a sign that he placed all his hopes in the fleet; and also by the valour with which he fought at Salamis. Aristides, in particular, saw in him a fit coadjutor to himself and antagonist to Themistocles, and exerted himself in his favour; and the readiness with which the allied Greeks, when disgusted by the arrogance of Pausanias, united themselves with Athens, was owing in a great measure to Cimon's mild temper and to his frank and gentle manners. The popularity of Themistocles was already declining, while Cimon, by a series of successful enterprises, was rapidly rising in public favour. He defeated the Persians in Thrace, on the banks of the Strymon, took Eion, and made himself master of the whole country. He conquered the island of Scyros, the inhabitants of which were addicted to piracy; and brought thence to Athens what were deemed the bones of the national hero Theseus. He next subdued all the cities on the coast of Asia Minor, and went against the Persian fleet which lay at the mouth of the Eurymedon. The Persians, although superior in number, did not dare to abide an engagement, but sailed up the river to place themselves under the protection of their land forces. Cimon, however, provoked them to a battle, and, having defeated and sunk or taken two hundred ships, landed his men, flushed with victory, and completely routed the Persian army. Returning to Athens after these two victories thus achieved in a single day, he employed the perquisites of his command, and the resources which he had acquired from his successes over the barbarians, in the embellishment of his native city and in relieving the wants of the indigent. He laid a part of the foundations of the Long Walls with magnificent solidity at his own cost, and the southern wall of the <cb /> citadel was built with the treasures which he brought from Asia into the coffers of the State. He also set the example of adorning the public places of the city with trees; and, by introducing a stream of water, converted the Academy, a spot about two miles north of the city, from an arid waste into a delightful grove. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacademia">Academia</ref>.) He threw down the fences of his fields and orchards, that all who wished might enter and partake of their fruits. He not only gave the usual entertainments expected from the rich to the members of his own borough, but kept a table constantly open for them. He never appeared in public without a number of persons attending him in good apparel, who, when they met with any elderly citizen scantily clothed, would insist on exchanging their warm mantles for his threadbare covering. It was the office of the same persons respectfully to approach any of the poorer citizens of good character whom they might see standing in the market-place, and silently to put some small pieces of money into their hands. This latter kind of expenditure was certainly of a mischievous tendency; and was not the less that of a demagogue because Cimon sought popularity not merely for his own sake, but for that of his order and his party.</p>
 <p>About B.C. 466, Cimon was sent to the Thracian Chersonesus, of which the Persians still kept possession, and having driven them out, next reduced the island of Thasus, and took possession of the Thasian gold mines on the neighbouring continent. Scarcely, however, had he returned to Attica, when an accusation was preferred against him of having been corrupted by the king of Macedonia, because he had refrained, not, according to the common account, from attacking the Macedonians then at peace with Athens, but from striking a blow at the Thracian tribes on the frontier of that kingdom, who had recently cut off the Athenian settlers on the banks of the Strymon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphipolis">Amphipolis</ref>.) From this accusation Cimon had a very narrow escape. Having been sent, however, after this, with a body of troops to aid the Spartans before Ithomé, and the latter having, after some interval, sent back their Athenian allies, whom they suspected of not lending them any effectual assistance, the irritation produced by this national insult fell principally upon Cimon, who was known to be an admirer of the Spartan character and constitution, and he was accordingly driven into exile. Subsequent events, however, made the Athenians feel the want of this able commander, and he was recalled and sent on an expedition against Egypt and Cyprus; but was carried off by illness, or the consequences of a wound, in the harbour of Citium, which place he was besieging (B.C. 449). His spirit, however, still animated his countrymen; for the fleet, when sailing home with his remains, gained a naval victory over a large squadron of Phoenician and Cilician galleys near the Cyprian Salamis, and followed up this victory by another which they gained on shore, either over the troops which had landed from the enemy's ships, or over a land force by which they were supported.</p>
 <p>Cimon was, beyond dispute, the ablest and most successful general of his day; and his victories shed a lustre on the arms of Athens which almost dimmed the glories of Marathon and Salamis.

 <p>A Roman patrician, whose name belongs to the earlier history of the Republic, and has a well-known and spiritstirring legend connected with it. His son, Caeso Quinctius, had been banished on account of his violent language towards the tribunes, and the father had retired to his own patrimony, aloof from popular tumults. The successes of the Aequi and Volsci in B.C. 458 rendered the appointment of a dictator necessary, and Cincinnatus was chosen to that high office. The delegates who were sent to announce this to him found the Roman noble ploughing his own fields, and from the plough he was transferred to the highest magistracy of his native State. The dictator laid aside his rural habiliments, assumed the ensigns of absolute power, levied a new army, marched all night to bring the necessary succour to the consul Minucius, who was surrounded by the enemy and blockaded in his camp, and before morning surrounded the enemy's army, and reduced it to a condition exactly similar to that in which the Romans had been placed. The baffled Aequi were glad to submit to the victor's terms; and Cincinnatus, thereupon returning in triumph to Rome, laid down his dictatorial power, after having held it only fourteen days, and returned to his farm. At an advanced age he was again appointed dictator, to restrain the power of Spurius <ref type="cross" target="crossmaelius">Maelius</ref> (q.v.), and again proved himself the deliverer of his country (Val.

<head orig="Cinna">Cinna</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Cornelius</hi>. An adherent of Marius, who played a conspicuous part in the civil war between that leader and Sulla. Having attained to the consulship, after the proscription of Marius by his opponent, he began to exert himself for the recall of the former, and accused Sulla , who was just going as proconsul to Asia, of maladministration. That commander, however, took no notice of the complaint. After the departure of Sulla , he brought forward once more the law of Sulpicius, which admitted the Italians into all the thirty-five tribes without distinction. A savage riot ensued, numbers were slain, and Cinna , with his chief partisans, was driven from the city by his colleague Octavius. The Italian towns, regarding the cause of Cinna as their own, received him with the utmost cordiality. He collected thirty legions, called the proscribed to his support, and, with Marius, Sertorius, and Carbo , marched upon and took possession of Rome. A scene of bloodshed and lawless rapine now ensued, which has perhaps no parallel in ancient or modern times, and has deservedly procured for those who were the actors in it the unmitigated abhorrence of posterity. Cinna and Marius, by their own authority, now declared themselves consuls for the ensuing year; but Marius dying, after having held that office for only seventeen days, Cinna remained in effect the absolute master of Rome. During the space of three years after this victory of his, he continued to hold possession of the government at home, a period during which, as Cicero remarks, the Republic was without laws and without dignity. At length, however, Sulla , after terminating the war with Mithridates, prepared to march home with his army and punish his opponents. Cinna , with his colleague Carbo , resolved thereupon to cross the Adriatic, and anticipate Sulla by attacking him in Greece; but a mutiny of their troops ensued, in which Cinna was slain, B.C. 77. Haughty, violent, always eager for vengeance, addicted to 
<pb n="349" /><cb />
 debauchery, precipitate in his plans, but always displaying courage in their execution, Cinna attained to a power little less absolute than that afterwards held by Sulla or Caesar; and it is somewhat remarkable that he should be so little known that scarcely a single personal anecdote of him is to be found on record.</p>

Helvius composed a poem entitled <title>Smyrna</title> (or <title>Zmyrna</title>), on which he was employed nine or ten years. Four fragments of it have reached us.

<head orig="Circé">Circe</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κίρκη</foreign>). The sister of Aeëtes, king of Colchis, and daughter of the Sun and Persé, or Perseïs, one of the ocean-nymphs. Circé is celebrated for her skill in magic arts, and for her knowledge of subtle poisons. According to Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 10. 135" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>x. 135</bibl> foll.), she dwelt in an island (Aeaea), attended by four nymphs, and all persons who approached her dwelling were first feasted, and then, on tasting the contents of her magic cup, converted into beasts. When Odysseus had been thrown on her shores, he deputed some of his companions to explore the country; these, incautiously partaking of the banquet set before them, were, by the effect of the enchanted potion, transformed into swine. When Odysseus himself, on hearing of their misfortune from Eurylochus, set out to release them or share their fate, he was met by Hermes, who gave him a plant named <hi rend="italic">moly</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">μῶλυ</foreign>), potent against her magic, and directed him how to act. Accordingly when she handed him the medicated cup, he drank of it freely; and Circé, thinking it had produced its usual effect, striking him with her wand, bade him go join his comrades in their sty. But Odysseus, drawing his sword, threatened to slay her; and the terrified goddess bound herself by a solemn oath to do him no injury. She afterwards, at his desire, restored his companions to their pristine form, and they all abode in her dwelling for an entire year. Circé is said to have had by Odysseus a son named <ref type="cross" target="crosstelegonus">Telegonus</ref> (q.v.), who afterwards unwittingly slew his own father in Ithaca, whither he had wandered in search of him. See <ref type="cross" target="crossodysseus">Odysseus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Later writers took great liberties with the narratives of Homer and Hesiod. Thus, for example, Dionysius, the Cyclic poet, makes Circé the daughter of Aeëtes by Hecaté, the daughter of his brother Perses. He goes on to say that she was 
<pb n="350" /><cb />
 married to the king of the Sarmatians, whom she poisoned and seized his kingdom; but, governing tyrannically, she was expelled, and then fled to a desert isle of the ocean, or, as some said, to the headland named from her in Italy. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscirceii">Circeii</ref>.) The Latin writers thence took occasion to connect Circé with their own scanty mythology. See Cic. <bibl n="Cic.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">περίπολοι</foreign>). Horsemen who made the rounds in the Roman camp, and inspected the sentry posts.

After receiving their orders, they went and posted themselves by the first maniple of the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, the centurion of which was required to see that the hours of the watch were properly given by the sound of the trumpet; then, when the time came, the <seg lang="la">circuitor</seg> of the first watch proceeded on his rounds to all the posts; if he found the guards awake and on duty, he took their tablets; if he found them asleep, or any one absent from his post, he called upon the friends who accompanied him to witness the fact, and so passed on to the next post.

<head orig="Circus">Circus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κίρκος</foreign>). A building used by the Romans for chariot races and other amusements, the general form of which was borrowed from the <foreign lang="greek">ἱππόδρομος</foreign> of the Greeks. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshippodromus">Hippodromus</ref>.) Its name is derived from the circuit made by the racing chariots (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 153).</p>
 <p>The Circus Maximus in Rome was for a long time the only building of the kind, and appears to have been the model from which all later <seg lang="la">circi</seg> were copied. Vitruvius does not mention the circus in his treatise on Roman architecture. According to the legend, Romulus held the Consualia, or games in honour of the Latin deity Consus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossconsualia">Consualia</ref>), in the Vallis Murcia, a long, narrow depression between the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was during the celebration of these games that the rape of the Sabine women is said to have taken place (Val. Max. ii. 4). The long, level bottom and sloping sides of the Vallis Murcia made it a naturally convenient place for races to be held and seen by a crowd of spectators, who probably stood or sat on the grassy slopes of the two hills long before any architectural structure was erected. See Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Ars 1.107" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>A. A.</title> i. 107.</bibl></p>
 <p>Wooden seats (<seg lang="la">fori</seg>) for the people are said to have been first constructed by Tarquinius Priscus ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 35</bibl>), and these were frequently burnt and rebuilt in the same material: restorations in B.C. 327 and B.C. 174 are mentioned by Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 8.20" default="NO" valid="yes">viii. 20</bibl>, and <bibl n="Liv. 41.27" default="NO" valid="yes">xli. 27</bibl>). In the time of Iulius Caesar some of the seats were for the first time constructed of stone, but even then and many years later the upper tiers and galleries were still of wood. Very serious accidents are recorded to have happened under many of the emperors, owing to the failure of the wooden seats when crowded with people. No less than 1000 persons are said to have been killed in this way during the reign of Antoninus Pius. Dionysius (iii. 68), who describes the Circus Maximus as it was after Iulius Caesar's improvements, says that it then held 150,000 people. A destructive fire in B.C. 31 was followed by important restorations, and Augustus added a magnificent marble <seg lang="la">pulvinar</seg> or imperial box, and placed in the centre of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> the Egyptian obelisk which now stands in the Piazza del Popolo ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>43</bibl>-45). In A.D. 36, another fire destroyed the upper tiers of seats on the Aventine side, and a great part of the Circus was soon restored and enlarged 
<pb n="351" /><cb />
 by Claudius, who rebuilt in white marble the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg>, which were then of tufa, and replaced the old wooden <seg lang="la">metae</seg> by new ones of gilt bronze ( <title>Claud.</title> 21). After this restoration the Circus contained seats, partly of marble and partly of wood, for 250,000 spectators, showing that it had been much enlarged since the rebuilding of Iulius Caesar ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  102" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 102</bibl>). In the reign of Domitian the marble seats were carried still higher, and thenceforth the danger of fire was much diminished, though wooden galleries (<hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi>) appear to have existed at the top of the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> for many years later.</p>
 <p>Great additional splendour was given to the Circus Maximus by Trajan, as is recorded on the reverse of some of his first brasses; and from his time the building must have been among the most magnificent structures of the Roman world. The whole <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> with its tiers of seats, the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg>, the emperor's <seg lang="la">pulvinar</seg>, and the central <seg lang="la">spina</seg> were then of gleaming white marble, decorated with gold and colours, studded with jewel-like glass mosaics, and adorned with long lines of columns made of richly-tinted Oriental marbles and rows of large statues in marble and gilt bronze, together with costly metal screens and richly <figure id="fig.00351">
<head orig="Circus Maximus. (Restoration by Benvenuti.)">Circus Maximus. (Restoration by Benvenuti.)</head>
</figure> sculptured thrones for officials of rank ( <title>Paneg.</title> 51). Still further accommodation was added by Constantine; and Constantius set on the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> a second obelisk, which his father had transported from Thebes (Aurel. Vict. <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 40" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>40</bibl>), and which now stands in the piazza of the Lateran. After this final enlargement the Circus held, according to the <title>Notitia</title>, the almost incredible number of 385,000 people. The best MS. of the <title>Notitia</title> gives 485,000 as the number of possible spectators in the Circus, which probably includes the crowds of people outside the Circus on the upper slopes of the two hills, who would have a distinct though distant view of the whole arena. It is impossible to discover with absolute accuracy what the size of the Circus Maximus was when complete; it cannot, however, have been less than 2000 feet long, by more than 600 feet wide, measuring outside.</p>
 <p>In spite of its enormous size very little now remains of the Circus Maximus; but the excavations of recent years have brought to light some very interesting portions of the substructures; and these, with the help of some drawings made in the sixteenth century, when a considerable portion of the Circus was still very complete, enable us to form a fairly accurate notion of its plan and <cb /> general construction. Additional help is given by the well-preserved remains of the Circus of Maxentius, of which a plan is given on the following page. Though quite different in ground-plan, yet in the arrangement of the seats and in its external façade the Circus once closely resembled the <ref type="cross" target="crosscolosseum">Colosseum</ref> (q.v.), except that the general effect must have been much more splendid, since in the Circus nothing but marble and gilt bronze was visible. Part of the exterior façade of the Circus is fortunately shown in the great oil-painting in the museum at Mantua, giving a bird's-eye view of Rome as it was in the fifteenth century. A fac-simile of this is shown in De Rossi's <title>Piante di Roma anteriori al XVImo Secolo</title> <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1879)</bibl>. See also Middleton, <title>Anc. Rome in 1885</title>, p. 287, and fig. 10 on p. 83; id. <bibl default="NO"><title>Remains of Anc. Rome</title> (London, 1892)</bibl>, vol. ii. pp. 40- 60; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Roma</ref>. There is an interesting etching of the sixteenth century which shows a large portion (now destroyed) of the concrete vaults which supported the long line of the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> seats. Excavations made a few years ago at the foot of the south western slope of the Palatine have exposed a long series of chambers, which formed part of the immense substructures of the Circus. These chambers were used for brothels ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 65" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 65</bibl>), for refreshment stalls ( <bibl n="Dionys.  7. 72" default="NO">Dionys.vii. 72</bibl>), and other purposes. They open upon a road, paved with flint blocks, which appears to have run at the foot of the Palatine along the whole northeastern side of the Circus, and led from the Forum boarium to the Porta Capena.</p>
 <p>Owing to their lofty positions, the palace of Augustus and the other imperial buildings on the Palatine must have commanded a very complete view of the races in the Circus; and some of the emperors built special additions to their palaces to enable them to see the games without leaving their residences ( <title>Calig.</title> 18). See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalatium">Palatium</ref>.</p>

 <p>According to Livy , the Roman senators from a very early period had the privilege of special seats at the Circus. Augustus arranged a complete classification of the spectators.

 this classification, the fact that men and women sat together in the Circus had been one of its peculiarities as a place of amusement—a fact often alluded to by Ovid. Cushions (<seg lang="la">pulvini</seg>) were used, especially by ladies, on the hard marble seats, and footstools (<seg lang="la">scabella</seg>) were sometimes introduced, though each <seg lang="la">gradus</seg> was so low—only thirteen to fourteen inches high—that these can have been of but little use. See Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Ars 1.160" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>A. A.</title> i. 160-162.</bibl></p>
 <p>A large number of interesting inscriptions have been found at different times, which throw much light on the way in which the seats were apportioned in the <seg lang="la">circi</seg> and amphitheatres of Rome. (See Lanciani, <title>Inscriz. d. Anfit. Flav.</title>, Rome, 1884.) The <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> was divided into bands called <hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi> by the horizontal passages, <seg lang="la">ambulacra</seg> or <seg lang="la">praecinctiones;</seg> there were probably three of these divisions or <hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi> in the Circus Maximus, without counting the gallery at the top. The lowest of these divisions was called <seg lang="la">maenianum primum</seg>, and the highest was called <seg lang="la">summum;</seg> each of these bands of seats was also divided by flights of steps into <seg lang="la">cunei</seg>, which were numbered; each line of seats (<seg lang="la">gradus</seg>) in each <seg lang="la">cuneus</seg> was also numbered; and as there were no divisions to separate one place from the next, each <seg lang="la">gradus</seg> was measured, and allotment was made to various classes of a fixed number of feet measured from one end. Thus, for example, the space allotted to a <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> of priests might be described as follows: “In the first <hi rend="italic">maenianum</hi>, in the twelfth <seg lang="la">cuneus</seg>, nine feet of <seg lang="la">gradi</seg> 4 and 5.”</p>
 <p>In addition to the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> proper and its <seg lang="la">podium</seg>, various state boxes were constructed of marble, with columns and arches to support the entablature and roof of each. One series of these (<seg lang="la">cubicula</seg> or <seg lang="la">suggestus</seg>) was over the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg>, and appears to have been occupied by the giver of the games (<seg lang="la">editor spectaculorum</seg>) and his friends. Another elevated box (the <seg lang="la">tribunal iudicum</seg>, D) was placed at one side for the umpires, who decided which chariot first crossed the line chalked on the arena in front of them. See Henzen, <title>Acta Fratrum Arval</title>, p. 37 <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1874)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>A separate <seg lang="la">pulvinar</seg> or state box (E) for the imperial family, of great size and magnificence, was erected on the Palatine side of the Circus Maximus ( <title>Claud.</title> 4). An interesting relief of the third century A.D., found at Foligno, represents the presiding magistrate or <seg lang="la">editor</seg> of the games seated in <cb /> his box over the <seg lang="la">carceres;</seg> he holds in his hand a bag of money, which he is about to give to the winning charioteer, who has driven up and is saluting him from below. A similar scene is represented on several of the ivory consular diptychs of the fourth and fifth centuries. (See Gori, <title>Thesaur. Vet. Dipt.</title>, Florence, 1759). The chief of these is the celebrated leaf of a fourth century diptych in the Museo Quiriniano at Brescia. On this the presiding consul sits in his <seg lang="la">pulvinar;</seg> in the arena below four <seg lang="la">quadrigae</seg> are racing round the <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, which, like that on the Lyons mosaic, is a long tank of water. The way in which the reins were looped round the body of the driver (<seg lang="la">auriga</seg>) is clearly shown; each holds in his hand what seems to be a combination of whip and goad; and they all wear <seg lang="la">fasciae</seg> round their legs and bodies. The horses' legs are also closely bound about with thongs. See Fröhner, <bibl default="NO"><title>La Verrerie Antique</title> (Paris, 1879)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>On the ivories the consul, or other president of the games, is usually represented in the <seg lang="la">pulvinar</seg>, magnificently robed in the <seg lang="la">toga picta</seg> and <seg lang="la">pallium</seg>, and in some cases holding in his hand the <seg lang="la">mappa</seg> or napkin with which he gave the signal for the start.</p>
 <p>The starting end of the Circus was formed by a row of small vaulted chambers (<seg lang="la">carceres</seg>, A A), each large enough for one chariot and its horses. Of these <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> there were at the most twelve. Each had two doors—one behind, by which the chariot entered, and one in front, opening into the arena. This latter doorway was closed by folding doors, with open work (<seg lang="la">cancelli</seg>) in the panels. These doors were thrown open at the start by slaves (<seg lang="la">tentores</seg>), two to each doorway (as in the accompanying illustration), who flung them open simul<figure id="fig.00352.2">
<head orig="Doors of Carceres opened by Slaves. (Museo Borgiano, Velletri.)">Doors of Carceres opened by Slaves. (Museo Borgiano, Velletri.)</head>
</figure> taneously at the signal. In early times the races appear to have begun at the <seg lang="la">carceres;</seg> but later, the actual start took place at a line marked on the arena with white chalk or lime (<seg lang="la">alba linea</seg>), and hence sometimes called <seg lang="la">creta</seg> or <hi rend="italic">calx</hi> (K). A similar white line for the finish was drawn opposite the judge's box (D), at a point unequally distant 
<pb n="353" /><cb />
 from the two <seg lang="la">metae.</seg> The starting-line was drawn opposite the <seg lang="la">metae</seg> that were nearest the <seg lang="la">carceres.</seg> The <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> received no light except what came <figure id="fig.00353">
<head orig="Doors of Carceres. (British Museum.)">Doors of Carceres. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> through the grating. Their narrow openings are called <seg lang="la">fauces.</seg> The lofty state-boxes above the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg>, with their colonnades and arches, towered to an imposing height, and the whole structure was known as the <seg lang="la">oppidum</seg>, from its resemblance to the gate and towers of a city (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 153).</p>
 <p>A brass of Caracalla shows the external façade of the <seg lang="la">oppidum</seg>, and a sort of bird's-eye view beyond of the interior of the Circus, with its <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, central obelisk, and <seg lang="la">aediculae</seg>, and statues in <seg lang="la">quadrigae</seg> set at the top of the wall surrounding the <seg lang="la">cavea.</seg> It will be seen from the typical plan given above that the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> (A A) are slightly curved on plan, and are constructed on a segmental line, the centre of which is struck from a point midway (N) between the line of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> and the side of the <seg lang="la">cavea.</seg> Thiś plan was adopted in order that the chariots in all the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> might have as nearly as possible a position of equal advantage at the start. The special <seg lang="la">carcer</seg> occupied by each chariot was fixed on by drawing lots.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">spina</seg> (back-bone) was a long, low wall, or rather platform, of marble (M M), set in the middle of the arena to separate the going and returning course of the racers. The line of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> is not parallel to that of the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg>, but is slightly inclined so as to leave a wider space at K than that near the semicircular end. The object of this seems to have been that the chariots might have more space where they were crowded together at the start than at other points where some would have begun to tail off.</p>
 <p>Various mosaics and reliefs show the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> (M M) covered with a series of statues and ornamental structures, such as obelisks, small <seg lang="la">aediculae</seg> or shrines, columns surmounted by statues, altars, trophies, and fountains. In addition to these were two sets of seven marble eggs (<seg lang="la">ova</seg>) at each end of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg>—each set mounted on a small <seg lang="la">aedicula</seg>, <figure id="fig.00353.2">
<head orig="Race in the Circus, showing the Spina, with the Dolphins, Obelisk, and Ova. (Ancient relief in the Vatican.)">Race in the Circus, showing the Spina, with the Dolphins, Obelisk, and Ova. (Ancient relief in the Vatican.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> to which access was given by a ladder. One of these eggs was removed after each lap (<seg lang="la">curriculum</seg>) was run (Varr. <title>Re Rust.</title> i. 2, 11), there being usually seven laps to each race (<seg lang="la">missus</seg>). According to Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 41.27" default="NO" valid="yes">xli. 27</bibl>), these <seg lang="la">ova</seg> were first set on the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> by the censors in B.C. 174; but Dio Cassius attributes their introduction to Agrippa, in the reign of Augustus. He is, however, probably confusing them with another series of ornaments—seven dolphins, which were set on a similar <seg lang="la">aedicula</seg> and served a similar purpose ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 590" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 590</bibl>). These dolphins must have been too heavy to take down, and were probably merely moved in some way to indicate the number of laps.</p>
 <p>In some ancient representations, as in a mosaic found at Lyons and figured on page 355, the dolphins form fountains—water spouting from the mouth of each fish. This shows that they could not have been wholly removed. The eggs had some sacred connection with the Dioscuri, and the dolphins with Neptune (or Consus)—deities who were the patrons of horses and racing (Tertull. <title>De Spect.</title> 8). The Lyons mosaic, which no doubt represents the local circus, has what appears to have <figure id="fig.00353.3">
<head orig="Metae. (Relief in the British Museum.)">Metae. (Relief in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure> been a common form of <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, consisting of a long tank of water instead of the marble <seg lang="la">podium;</seg> statues and other ornaments stand on pedestals in the water. Two sarcophagi in the Sala della Biga in the Vatican have reliefs which represent a chariot-race of Cupids in the Circus Maximus, and show clearly the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> and its ornaments, among which are statues of Apollo Helios, Cybelé, Victory, a quadriga, and an obelisk, as well as the eggs and dolphins. The <seg lang="la">metae</seg> are shown at each end; a similar relief is given in the illustration above.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">metae</seg> (L L), the goals, were three tall, conical objects (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10. 106" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>x. 106</bibl>;  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 5</bibl>) set on a semicircular plinth, at a short distance from each end of the <seg lang="la">spina.</seg> From the time of Claudius, they were of gilt bronze decorated with bands in relief, as is shown in the above illustration from a relief in the British Museum. These formed the turning-points for the chariots. The <seg lang="la">primae metae</seg> are not, as might be expected, the ones nearest to the start, but those near the semicircular end of the Circus, round which the 
<pb n="354" /><cb />
 chariots made their <hi rend="italic">first</hi> turn. Tertullian (<title>De Spect.</title> v. 8) mentions that the ancient altar of Consus in the Circus Maximus was <seg lang="la">ad primäs metas;</seg> it appears to have been in the <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, and was only exposed to view during the progress of the games.</p>
 <p>Remains of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, stripped of all its rich marble decorations, exist in the Circus of Maxentius, at Vienne in France (<title>Bull. Inst.</title> 1861, p. 143), and in the circus of Carthage (Falbe, <title>L'Emplacement de Carthage</title>, p. 40).</p>
 <p>The arena, or sandy floor of the Circus, like that of the Colosseum, was on some occasions strewn with glittering particles of mica, red lead, or perfumes, by the ostentatious extravagance of the emperors ( <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>18</bibl>). That part of the arena which formed the course for the chariots was known as the <seg lang="la">spatium</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 582" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 582</bibl>). The space near the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> was known as the <seg lang="la">circus primus</seg>, while that on each side of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> was the <seg lang="la">circus interior</seg> (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 154).</p>
 <p>Before the construction of amphitheatres in Rome, the Circus Maximus was used for gladiatorial fights with wild beasts and other scenes of butchery. The Ancyraean inscription records that Augustus had no less than 3500 wild beasts slaughtered in the Circus, Forum, and amphitheatre, in twenty-six exhibitions.</p>
 <p>In order to keep the beasts from reaching the spectators on the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg>, Iulius Caesar constructed a canal (<seg lang="la">euripus</seg>) ten feet wide and ten feet deep all round the arena; this was supplied by a stream which still runs through the site of the Circus, near the modern Via de' Cerchi ( <title>Iul.</title> 39). After the erection of the amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus in the reign of Augustus, the Circus Maximus appears to have been no longer used for fights with beasts, and the <seg lang="la">euripus</seg> was therefore filled up by Nero ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>viii. 21</bibl>). It was, however, again introduced in later times (Lamprid. <title>Heliog.</title> 23).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Other Circi at Rome</hi>.—Few remains of other <seg lang="la">circi</seg> exist to-day above ground at Rome. The important edifices of this sort were as follows:</p>
 <p>(1) The Circus Flaminius which gave its name to the Campus Flaminius, an important part of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscampus-martius">Campus Martius</ref> (q.v.). It was founded in honour of the censor C. Flaminius Nepos, killed at the battle of Lake Trasimenus, B.C. 217.</p>
 <p>(2) The Circus of Caligula and Nero in the Horti Agrippinae, at the foot of the Vatican Hill ( <title>Claud.</title> 21). No traces of this circus are visible at the present time.</p>
 <p>(3) The Circus of Hadrian in the Campus Vaticanus, near the emperor's Mausoleum. No traces of it now remain.</p>
 <p>(4) The Circus of Maxentius on the Via Appia, two miles from the walls of Rome, is sufficiently well preserved to show its original form, though it is completely stripped of its marble seats, columns, and other rich decorations. Till 1825 it was thought to be a circus built by Caracalla, but three inscriptions which were then found showed that it was dedicated in A.D. 311 to the memory of Romulus, who died in A.D. 309, by his father Maxentius. The plan of this circus is shown on page 352; the greater part of the external wall is still standing, but the concrete vaults which supported the seats have mostly fallen in.</p>
 <p>(5) The Circus of Sallust, called after the historian. <cb /></p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Circus Games</hi>.—The games in the circus (<title>Ludi Circenses</title>) opened with a grand procession (<seg lang="la">pompa</seg>), which gathered on the Capitoline Hill, passed down the Clivus Capitolinus into the Forum, along the Via Sacra, then branched off along the Vicus Tuscus, and so through the Velabrum into the Forum Boarium, where was the entrance into the Circus at the Porta Pompae. It then passed once round the <seg lang="la">spina</seg>, pausing to offer sacrifices and to salute the imperial <seg lang="la">pulvinar.</seg> The gorgeous procession which opens a modern bullfight in Spain bears much resemblance to the Roman <seg lang="la">pompa circensis:</seg> it winds round the arena, and then pauses to salute the presiding official, who gives the signal to begin by throwing a key to the chief <hi rend="italic">espada.</hi> The Roman procession was headed by the presiding magistrate, or in some cases by the emperor himself, in a <seg lang="la">biga</seg> or <hi rend="italic">quadriga</hi>, wearing the dress and insignia of a triumphant general; probably a survival from the time when the <seg lang="la">ludi circenses</seg> were celebrated in honour of victorious generals. A gold wreath was held over his head by a slave ( <bibl n="Liv.  5. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.v. 14</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  10. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.x. 35</bibl>-46; <bibl n="Dionys.  7. 72" default="NO">Dionys.vii. 72</bibl>). Next came a crowd of noble citizens on foot and on horseback; then the chariots and horsemen who were to take part in the games, accompanied by musicians. Next in order were priests, grouped in their various <seg lang="la">collegia;</seg> bearers of holy water, incense, and sacrificial implements; and statues of deities in chariots (<seg lang="la">tensae</seg>) drawn by horses, mules, or elephants, or else borne in litters (<seg lang="la">fercula</seg>) on men's shoulders, and attended by noble Roman youths ( <bibl n="Dionys.  7. 72" default="NO">Dionys.vii. 72</bibl>). Statues in litters and in a car drawn by four elephants are shown in an ancient sarcophagus relief figured in the <title>Ann. Inst.</title> 1839, tav. o. The games mainly consisted of chariot-races; the cars (<seg lang="la">currus</seg>) being drawn by various numbers of horses, from two up to ten, and called <seg lang="la">bigae, trigae, quadrigae, seiuges, septemiuges</seg>, and so on according to the number attached to each car. In early times <seg lang="la">bigae</seg> and <seg lang="la">quadrigae</seg> were mostly used; but under the later Empire wonderful skill was displayed by some of the drivers in managing a large number of horses. In a <seg lang="la">biga</seg> both horses were under a yoke (<seg lang="la">iugum</seg>), and were called <seg lang="la">equi iugales;</seg> in chariots with four or more horses, only the two in the middle were yoked; those at the sides were merely attached by traces (<seg lang="la">funes</seg>), and were therefore called <seg lang="la">equi funales.</seg></p>
 <p>The chariots were light structures of wood bound with bronze, high in front and open behind. The Sala della Biga in the Vatican is so named from an ancient (restored) marble chariot, possibly a votive offering for victory in the Circus. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurrus">Currus</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Aurigae.</title>—The drivers (<seg lang="la">aurigae</seg> or <seg lang="la">agitatores</seg>) were usually slaves or men of low class. They wore a short tunic laced round the body with leathern thongs (<seg lang="la">fasciae</seg>); other thongs bound their thighs. The accompanying illustration shows the statue of an <seg lang="la">auriga</seg>, no doubt some distinguished winner; it is now in the Vatican by the marble <seg lang="la">biga;</seg> the arms and legs have been restored, as well as the head. That shown in the cut does not belong to it. The <seg lang="la">aurigae</seg> wore a low, closefitting cap—not a bronze helmet. Though belonging to a despised class, the favourite <seg lang="la">aurigae</seg> in the degraded times of the Empire were much honoured and fêted, and their society was sought after by the dissolute Roman youth. Very great 
<pb n="355" /><cb />
 skill, courage, and coolness were required to guide a chariot successfully round the sharp turns of the <figure id="fig.00355">
<head orig="Statue of an Auriga. (Vatican.)">Statue of an Auriga. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> <seg lang="la">metae</seg>, among a jostling crowd of other horses and chariots, especially as each driver tried to upset his rivals. Constant accidents must have happened, for almost every ancient representation of a circus race shows one or more chariots overturned; and this was especially dangerous, as the <seg lang="la">auriga</seg> drove with the reins looped round his waist. That he might have a chance of cutting himself free in case of accident, he wore a curved knife (<seg lang="la">falx</seg>) stuck in his waist-bands; this is shown in the Vatican statue here given. No doubt one of the chief attractions of the Circus to the brutal Romans must have been the sight of the crushed limbs of an unfortunate driver among the struggling hoofs of his fallen horses, or under the wheels of a luckier rival. In spite of these dangers some drivers lived to win an enormous number of victories. The monument of the <seg lang="la">auriga</seg> Diocles (<hi rend="italic">circ.</hi> A.D. 150) records that he defeated Scorpus, the winner of 2048 races; MusclosusPomp. , the winner of 3559; and EpaphroditusPomp. , who had won 1467 times. Diocles himself, when he retired from his profession at the age of forty-two, had won 3000 races of <seg lang="la">bigae</seg>, and 1462 with more than two horses. The victorious <seg lang="la">auriga</seg> received a prize of money; or in some cases, if a slave, he won his freedom. The prize was sometimes called the <seg lang="la">brabeum</seg> or <hi rend="italic">bravium</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">βραβεῖον</foreign>, Prud. <title>Peristeph.</title> v. 538; cf. St. Paul, 1 Cor. ix. 24), and the giver of the prize was known as the <seg lang="la">brabeuta</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Nero 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 53</bibl>). The winners of important races, on which there was heavy betting, sometimes received enormous sums of money from patrons who had backed them ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 113" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 113</bibl><bibl n="Juv.  243" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv., 243</bibl>; <title>Claud.</title> 21; Capitol. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ver.</title>6</bibl>). Martial (x. 74, 5) mentions one named Scorpus, who, in the reign of Domitian, won no less than fifty purses of gold <figure id="fig.00355.2">
<head orig="Circus Games. (Lyons Mosaic.)">Statue of an Auriga. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> in one hour's racing. M. Renan in November, 1878, read before the Société des Inscriptions in Paris a paper on an interesting inscription found in Rome, which recorded that a Moorish <seg lang="la">auriga</seg> named Crescens had during ten years (A.D. 115-124) won 1,556,346 sesterces with four horses called Circus, Acceptus, Delicatus, and Cotynus. Under the Empire, wealthy Roman citizens were not ashamed to act the part of <seg lang="la">aurigae</seg>, especially after Caligula and Nero had set the example.</p>
 <p><title>Race-horses.</title>—The horses used for racing purposes were mostly bred in Spain, Sicily, Mauritania, northern Greece, and, in late times, in Cappadocia. No expense or trouble was spared in their training, and the Romans were careful not to spoil the horse (in the way the modern English racer is ruined) by using it too soon. As a rule the Roman racer was not broken in till the age of three, nor allowed to run in a race till five. Consequently some of the horses won a surprising number of victories. A horse which had won 100 races was called <seg lang="la">centenarius;</seg> in the inscription of Diocles a horse called Tuscus is mentioned as the winner of 429 races; a horse belonging to Diocles himself was a <seg lang="la">ducenarius.</seg> Like the modern Romans, the ancients seem to have disfigured their horses by branding on the flank the initial or badge of the owner; which is shown on several mosaic pavements. Stallions were used, and apparently but few mares were trained for races. Almost all the names of race-horses which exist in mosaic pictures or in inscriptions are those of males. See Friedländer, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Nominibus Equorum Circensium</title> (Königsberg, 1875)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The public training-stables of Rome consisted of six or more groups of buildings in Regio IX in the Campus Martius, and near the Circus Flaminius (see Jordan, <title>Topogr. der Stadt Rom</title>, ii. 554). In 1878, in the village of Oued-Atmenia in Algeria, some elaborate mosaic pavements were found in the villa of Pompeianus, proconsul of Africa under Honorius, who appears to have been a great breeder of Moorish horses for the Circus. Perspective views of the training-stables are represented on these mosaics, and other pictures show the racers in their stalls, carefully clothed from head to foot. The name of each horse is placed by it—e. g. Altus, Pullentianus, Delicatus, Polydoxus, etc., and an <seg lang="la">auriga</seg> named Cresconius is also depicted. Large coloured drawings of these by M. Martin were exhibited in Paris, in 1878, and afterwards published 
<pb n="356" /><cb />
 by the Archéol. de Constantine, in 1879. The training-stables seem to have been centres of intrigue and villainy of all kinds: bribes were given, and horses were often “hocussed.” Caligula, who spent much of his time in the stables of his favourite <seg lang="la">factio</seg>, is said to have poisoned the cleverest drivers of his rivals' horses. See Dio Cass. lix. 5 and 14.</p>
 <p>Large sums of money were lost and won on the races (<seg lang="la">sponsio</seg>, “betting,” <bibl n="Juv.  11. 202" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xi. 202</bibl>, with Mayor's note;  <bibl n="Plin.

Race-cards (<seg lang="la">libelli</seg>) were sold with lists of the horses and names of the drivers; and these were also given in the advertisements of the games, which were painted in large letters on conspicuous walls: examples of these have been found at Pompeii. In addition to the chariots and their drivers, men on horseback appear to have galloped with the racers, exciting them with shouts; after the race these <hi rend="italic">iubilatores</hi>, as they were called, seem to have called out the name of the winner. In some cases these attendants were on foot (<seg lang="la">cursores</seg>).</p>
 <p>In early times only four chariots ran in each race (<seg lang="la">missus</seg>), one for each colour (see below); in later times eight or even ten chariots started together. The starting signal was given by the presiding magistrate, who waved a <seg lang="la">mappa</seg> ( <bibl n="Liv.  8. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.viii. 40</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 2</bibl>; xlv. 1<bibl n="Liv.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 6</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  12. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 9</bibl>); and hence Juvenal (xi. 193) calls the circus games <seg lang="la">spectacula mappae.</seg> Seven laps or circuits (<seg lang="la">curricula</seg>) of the <seg lang="la">spina</seg> appear to have been the usual length of each <seg lang="la">missus.</seg> (See Varro, quoted by Aul. Gell. iii. 10.) On one occasion Domitian reduced the number of laps to five, in order to get 100 <seg lang="la">missus</seg> into one day. In early times very few races were run in a day; even in the time of Iulius Caesar they did not usually exceed ten or twelve. Caligula increased the number to twenty, or on very grand occasions twenty-four; but in later times a long succession of races was run throughout the whole day from sunrise to sunset.</p>
 <p>Intervals between sets of races were filled up by exhibitions of rope-dancing, tumbling, and feats of horsemanship, very like those of a modern circus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdesultor">Desultor</ref>.</p>
 <p>In addition to these races and games, the young Romans sometimes held reviews and assaults of arms (<seg lang="la">armaturae</seg>) in the Circus Maximus; these were sometimes on foot (<seg lang="la">armaturae pedestres</seg>) and sometimes on horseback (<hi rend="italic">equestres</hi>). One variety of this was called the <title>Ludus Troiae</title> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 11. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xi. 11</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>43</bibl>, and <bibl n="Suet. Nero 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 7</bibl>). Various other entertainments, such as feasts, were sometimes given in the Circus ( <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 1. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 28</bibl>); or money was flung among a crowd in the arena. On one occasion Probus planted and stocked an artificial forest with wild animals and birds in the Circus Maximus, and finally let in the people to kill and carry off what they could (Vop. <title>Prob.</title> 19).</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">factiones</seg> were companies or organizations of contractors who provided horses, drivers, and all other requisites for the games. The <seg lang="la">factio</seg> system was not developed till the time of the Empire; under the Republic a few citizens of knightly rank provided all the requisites. The giver of the entertainment (<seg lang="la">editor spectaculorum</seg>) only found the money, the whole business being managed by the <seg lang="la">factiones.</seg> Each <seg lang="la">factio</seg> was distinguished by a colour, which was worn by the <seg lang="la">aurigae</seg> and other performers in the <seg lang="la">ludi.</seg> At first there were only two <seg lang="la">factiones</seg>, distinguished by the colours red and <cb /> white, <seg lang="la">russata</seg> and <seg lang="la">albata;</seg> next blue (<hi rend="italic">veneta</hi>) was added, probably in the time of Augustus; and a fourth, green (<seg lang="la">prasina</seg>), came in soon after ( <bibl n="Juv.  11. 196" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xi. 196</bibl>; and Tertull. <title>De Spect.</title> 9). Lastly, Domitian added purple and gold—<seg lang="la">purpureus et auratus pannus</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Dom. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Dom.</title>7</bibl>). Under the later Empire each <seg lang="la">factio</seg> consisted of a sort of <seg lang="la">collegium</seg>, carefully organized and ranked in classes of every kind, such as the methodical and bureaucratic Romans delighted in. At the head of each was a <seg lang="la">factionis dominus</seg>, and under him were employés, slaves, and artisans of every sort required for the whole management of the <seg lang="la">ludi.</seg> The number and classes of a <seg lang="la">familia quadrigaria</seg> (a division of a <seg lang="la">factio</seg>) are given in an ancient inscription published by Gruter, 336-339. The <seg lang="la">familia</seg> consists of twenty-five <seg lang="la">decuriones</seg>—that is, at least 250 people, who are classified as follows: <seg lang="la">aurigae, agitatores</seg>, and <seg lang="la">quadrigarii</seg>, drivers of four-horse chariots; <seg lang="la">conditores</seg> and <seg lang="la">succonditores</seg>, grooms and helpers; <seg lang="la">sellarii</seg>, saddlers; <seg lang="la">sutores</seg>, cobblers; <seg lang="la">sarcinatores</seg>, tailors; <seg lang="la">margaritarii</seg>, pearl-embroiderers; <seg lang="la">medici</seg>, surgeons; <seg lang="la">magistri</seg> and <seg lang="la">doctores</seg>, perhaps trainers and instructors; <seg lang="la">viatores</seg>, messengers; <seg lang="la">vilici</seg>, farm-servants to supply fodder; <seg lang="la">tentores</seg>, probably the men who pulled the ropes to open the doors of the <seg lang="la">carceres; sparsores</seg>, water-men: these probably watered the dry arena to prevent clouds of dust from rising, and also brought water to refresh the men and horses.</p>
 <p>The rivalry between the different colours of the factions and the heavy betting on the races often led to scenes of riot and bloodshed. Even in Rome, faction fights frequently took place towards the declining period of the Empire, but it was not till after the transference of the Roman capital to Constantinople that these disturbances reached their highest pitch. In the sixth century, the great circus at Constantinople was frequently the scene of the most hideous slaughter, and on one occasion in the reign of Justinian the tumult was not suppressed till about 30,000 of the rioters had been killed (see Gibbon, <title>Decline and Fall</title>, cap. xl.). A great part of this circus is still well preserved, though stripped of all its rich marble linings and columns.</p>

 <p> A poem falsely ascribed to Vergil, and sometimes printed with his works. It consists of 541 hexameter lines, giving an account of the treacherous conduct of the Megarian princess Scylla towards her father, Nisus, and her transformation into the bird Ciris. It is dedicated to the son of Messalla, and draws largely upon Vergil's verse, eleven lines being copied outright, and eight with the change of only one word. Other portions suggest Catullus and occasionally Lucretius.

<head orig="Claudiānus">Claudianus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossclaudius">Claudius</ref>. A Latin poet, born at Alexandria in the second half of the fourth century A.D. In A.D. 395, he came to Rome. Here he won the favour of the powerful Vandal, Stilicho, and on the proposal of the Senate was honoured with a statue by the emperors Arcadius and Honorius. The inscription on this statue is still in existence (Mommsen, <title>Inscriptiones Regni Neapolitani</title>, No. 6794). His patron Stilicho fell in 408, and Claudian, apparently, did not survive him. We have express evidence that the poet was not a Christian. He was familiar with Greek and Latin literature, and had considerable poetical gifts, including a mastery of both language and metre. These gifts raise him far above the crowd of the later Latin poets, although the effect of his writing is marred by tasteless rhetorical ornament and exaggerated flattery of great men. His political poems, in spite of their laudatory colouring, have considerable historical value. Most of them are written in praise of Honorius and of Stilicho, for whom he had a veneration as sincere as was his hatred of Rufinus and Eutropius. Against the latter he launched a number of invectives. Besides the <title>Raptus Proserpinae</title>, or <title>Rape of Proserpine</title>, an unfinished epic in three books, in which his descriptive power is very brilliantly displayed, his most important poems are: (1) <title>De III. IV. VI. Consulatu Honorii;</title></p>
 <p>(2) <title>De Nuptiis Honorii Fescennina;</title></p>
 <p>(3) <title>Epithalamium de Nuptiis Honorii et Mariae;</title></p>

 <p>(5) <title>De Consulatu Stilichonis;</title></p>
 <p>(6) <title>De Bello Pollentino;</title></p>
 <p>(7) <title>Laus Serenae</title>, Serena being Stilicho's wife;</p>
 <p>(8) <title>Eidyllia</title>, seven in number;</p>
 <p>(9) <title>Epigrammata; Gigantomachia</title>, a fragment. He also wrote epistles in verse, a series of minor pieces, narrative and descriptive, and letters to Serena, and miscellaneous poems, including one on the magnet (<title>Magnes</title>).</p>
 <p>The <title>Raptus Proserpinae</title> has come down in separate MSS., of which the best are two Codices Laurentiani, preserved in the Laurentine Library at Florence. These are of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries respectively. Others are at Leyden. Of the remaining poems there are excerpts (Excerpta Lucensia) from a lost MS., now at Florence; and others (Excerpta Gyraldina) from the lost Codex Gyraldinus, now at Leyden. Good MSS. are also in the Vatican at Rome and in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. Editions of Claudianus have been published by Pulmann <bibl default="NO">(Antwerp, 1571)</bibl>, J.

 <p> See <ref type="cross" target="crossclaudia-gens">Claudia Gens</ref>. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Appius Claudius Sabīnus Regillensis</hi>. A Sabine, a native of Regillum, and ïn his own country called Attus Clausus. He belonged to the pro-Roman party among his people, and when his advice was disregarded and war broke out between the two nations, he led a large number of seceders to Rome (B.C. 504), where he was enrolled among the patricians and received a large grant of land beyond the Anio. He was the founder of the great gens Claudia, one of the noblest in Roman history. He was a typical aristocrat, and his conduct towards the plebeians was marked by so much intolerance and severity during his consulship (B.C. 495) as to lead to the famous secession to the Mons Sacer in the following year.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Appius Claudius Sabīnus Regillensis</hi>. A son of the preceding, consul in B.C. 471. He was famed for the severity of his military discipline, which he pushed to such extremes that his soldiers deserted him. Having on this account been impeached by the tribunes, he committed suicide.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Claudius Sabīnus Regillensis</hi>. A brother of the preceding, and one of the more moderate of the patricians. He defended his brother(?), the decemvir, when the latter was impeached.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Appius Claudius Crassus Sabīnus Regillensis</hi>, usually called the son of No. 2, but possibly the same person. He was consul in B.C. 451, and in the same year became one of the decemvirs appointed to revise the laws. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecemviri">Decemviri</ref>.) In the following year he was reappointed, but his tyrannous conduct towards the plebeians, and especially his relation to the affair of Virginia, led to the downfall of the decemvirate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvirginia">Virginia</ref>.) Being impeached by Virginius, he either committed suicide or was killed in prison before his trial.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Appius Claudius Caecus</hi>. A famous Roman, censor in B.C. 312. During his term of office he commenced the Via Appia and built the great Appian aqueduct. He retained the censorship for four years beyond the time allowed by law, and was twice consul (B.C. 307 and 296), and in the latter year carried on war against the Samnites and Etruscans. As an old man, Appius induced the Senate to reject the proposals for peace made by Cineas on behalf of Pyrrhus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspyrrhus">Pyrrhus</ref>.) He was the first Roman writer of prose and verse of whom we have any record, being the author of a poem (subject unknown), and of a legal treatise <title>De Usurpationibus.</title> With Cn. Flavius, he published also a calendar of the religious festivals, and <seg lang="la">legis actiones.</seg> According to Quintilian (ii. 16, 7), he was the first to distinguish the two sounds R and S in writing. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrhotacism">Rhotacism</ref>.) Martianus Capella says that he set the fashion of omitting the use of the character Z. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalphabet">Alphabet</ref>.)

When, previous to a naval engagement with the Carthaginians, the person who had charge of the sacred fowls told him that they would not eat, which was esteemed a bad omen, he ordered them to be thrown into the sea, exclaiming, “Then let them drink.” After this, joining battle with the foe, he was defeated with the loss of his fleet. Having been recalled by the Senate, he gave another specimen of the haughty temper of the Claudian race, for, on being directed to nominate a dictator, he purposely named his own <seg lang="la">viator</seg>, an individual of the lowest rank ( <bibl n="Cic.

 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Appius Claudius Pulcher</hi>. A consul in B.C. 143, when he defeated the Salassi, an Alpine tribe. On his return, the Senate refused to give him a triumph, and when one of the tribunes tried to drag him from his chariot, he and his daughter Claudia, a Vestal, walked together to the Capitol. He was fatherin-law to Tib. Gracchus, and acted as triumvir for the division of the public lands. He died soon after the death of Gracchus.</p>
 <p>(10) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Nero</hi>, father of the emperor Tiberius. He was distinguished for his naval skill in the Alexandrine War, under Iulius Caesar. At a subsequent period he incited a sedition in Campania by promising to restore the property of those who had suffered in the Civil Wars. This tumult, however, was soon quelled by the arrival of Octavianus; and Tiberius, together with his wife Livia, took refuge in Sicily and Achaia until the establishment of the Second Triumvirate made it safe for him to return to Rome. Livia having after this engaged the affections of Octavianus, Tiberius transferred to him the name and privileges of a husband ( <bibl n="Tac.

 <p>(11) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Nero Caesar Germanĭcus</hi>, the successor of Augustus, and son of the preceding. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstiberius">Tiberius</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(12) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Caesar Germanĭcus</hi>, more commonly known by his historical name of Claudius, succeeded to the Roman Empire on the death of Caligula. He was the second son of Drusus and Antonia, and consequently grand-nephew to Augustus. When the assassination of Caligula was made known, the first impulse of the court party and of the foreign guards was to massacre all who had participated in the murder. Several persons of distinction, who imprudently exposed themselves, became, in consequence, the victims of their fury. This violence subsided, however, upon their discovering Claudius, who had concealed himself in an obscure corner of the palace, and who, being dragged from his hiding-place, threw himself at their feet in the utmost terror and besought them to spare his life. The soldiers in the palace immediately saluted him emperor, and Claudius, in return, set the first example of paying the army for the imperial dignity by a largess from the public treasury. It is difficult to assign any other motive for the choice which the army made of Claudius than that which they themselves professed, “his relationship to the whole family of the Caesars.” Claudius, who was now 
<pb n="361" /><cb />
 fifty years old, had never done anything to gain popularity, or to display those qualities which secure the attachment of the soldiery. He had been a rickety child, and the development of his faculties was retarded by his bodily infirmities; and although he outgrew his complaints, and became distinguished as a polite scholar and an eloquent writer, his spirits never recovered from the effects of disease and of severe treatment, and he retained much of the timidity and indolence of his childhood. During the reign of Tiberius he gave himself up to gross sensuality, and consoled himself under this degradation by the security which it brought with it. Under Caligula also he found <figure id="fig.00361">
<head orig="The Emperor Claudius. (Bust in the Vatican.)">The Emperor Claudius. (Bust in the Vatican.)</head>
</figure> his safety consist in maintaining his reputation for incapacity, and he suffered himself to become the butt of court parasites and the subject of their practical jokes. The excitement of novelty, on his first accession to the throne, produced efforts of sagacity and prudence of which none who had previously known him believed him capable; and during the whole of his reign, too, we find judicious and useful enactments occasionally made, which would seem to show that he was not in reality so foolish and incompetent as historians have generally represented him. It is most probable, therefore, that the fatuity which characterizes some parts of his conduct was the result, not <cb /> of natural imbecility, but of the early and unlimited indulgence of sensuality. <figure id="fig.00361.2">

 <p>Claudius embellished Rome with many magnificent works; he made Mauritania a Roman province; his armies fought successfully against the Germans; and he himself triumphed magnificently in victories over the Britons, and obtained, together with his infant son, the surname of Britannicus. But in other respects he was wholly governed by worthless favourites, and especially by his empress, the profligate and abandoned <ref type="cross" target="crossmessalina">Messalina</ref> (q.v.), whose cruelty and rapacity were as unbounded as her licentiousness. At her instigation it was but too common for the emperor to put to death, on false charges of conspiracy, some of the wealthiest of the nobles, and to confiscate their estates, with the money arising from which she openly pampered her numerous paramours. When the career of this guilty woman was terminated, Claudius was governed for a time by his freedman, Narcissus, and Pallas, another manumitted slave, until he took to wife his own niece, Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus, a woman of strong natural abilities, but of insatiable avarice, extreme ambition, and remorseless cruelty. Her influence over the feeble emperor was boundless. She prevailed on him at last to set aside his own son Britannicus, and to adopt her son, Domitius Ahenobarbus, by her former husband, giving him the name by which he is best known, Nero, and constituting him heir to the imperial throne. Claudius having afterwards shown a disposition to change the succession and restore it to Britannicus, fell a victim to the ambition of Agrippina, who caused him to be poisoned. A dish of mushrooms was prepared for the purpose, a kind of food of which the emperor was known to be especially fond, and the effects of the poison were hastened by the pretended remedies administered by Xenophon, the physician of the palace. It was given out that Claudius had suffered from indigestion, which his habitual gluttony rendered so frequent that it excited no surprise; and his death was concealed till Domitius Nero had secured the guards, and had quietly taken possession of the imperial authority. Claudius died in the sixty-fourth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign, A.D. 54. His biography is to be found in the <title>Lives</title> of Suetonius. See BaringGould, <title>The Tragedy of the Caesars</title>, vol. i. <bibl default="NO">(London, 1892)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(13) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Aurelius Claudius Gothĭcus</hi>. A Roman emperor, who reigned from A.D. 268 to 270. He was of an obscure Illyrian family, but won distinction by his brilliant military service under Decius, Valerian, and Gallienus, so that on the death of the last he succeeded to the imperial office. As emperor he won two great victories, defeating the Alemanni in the north of Italy, and in the next year (A.D. 269) the Goths in Dardania at Naïsus. He died at Sirmium in the year 270.

In course of time locks and keys were made, much like those of modern times. Locks were used in Egypt at an early period, and were originally of wood, probably like those now used there, which are opened by a key furnished with several fixed pins, answering to a similar number that fall down into the movable <cb /> tongue, into which the key is introduced, when they fasten or open the lock. At a later time we find iron keys in Egypt, consisting of a long straight shank, with three or more projecting teeth, like the one figured in preceding column. The earliest mention of a key, like our own, which could be taken out of the lock, is in the Book of Judges (iii. 23, 25). <figure id="fig.00362.3">

 <p>The cut below represents a curious bronze key, with a ring for suspension, found in the ruins of Novum Ilium. “It has the shape of the so-called quadrangular images of Hermes, with an altar-like base forming one piece with the body, to which a quadrangular projection is fixed on the back, with a hole corresponding to the lockbolt” (Schliemann, <title>Ilios</title>, pp. 620, 621).</p>
 <p> Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.  198" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H.

</figure> Laconian key had three teeth (<foreign lang="greek">τρεῖς γομφίους</foreign>), probably like the Egyptian key figured above. Keys are mentioned by Aeschylus and Euripides; and Lysias, in his speech on the murder of Eratosthenes, speaks of the wife shutting the door and taking the key with her (<foreign lang="greek">τὴν κλεῖν ἐφέλκετια</foreign>, c. 4), so that the husband was shut up in his chamber. In this case the door must have been locked from the outside.</p>
 <p>Many Roman keys have been found much like our own, the larger ones usually of iron and the smaller of bronze; but there were also keys made of wood and gold in use in later times. Besides these there was the <foreign lang="greek">βαλανάγρα</foreign>, a key or hook, which was passed through a hole in the door-post, and raised the <foreign lang="greek">βάλανοι</foreign> or bolts of the lock, as in the Egyptian locks described above ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 155" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 155</bibl>). It must have been a lock of this kind which the robber in Apuleius ( <bibl n="Ov.

 <p>The street-door was usually fastened inside by bolts (<seg lang="la">pessuli</seg>) and a bar (<seg lang="la">sera</seg>), but it also had a key which the <seg lang="la">ianitor</seg> of the house kept.

 <p>When a Roman woman first entered her husband's house, the keys of the store-rooms were handed to her.

It is supposed that they served to attach thin plates of the same metal to the masonry, as a coating for the interior of the chamber; and hence it is that these subterranean works, which served for prisons as well as treasuries, like the one in which Danaé is said to have been confined, were called by the poets “brazen chambers.” Two of these nails are represented in the annexed illustration, of two thirds the real size; they consist of 88 parts of copper to 12 of tin. <figure id="fig.00363.2">

 <p>It is difficult to say to what use this nail was applied.

<head orig="Clavus Latus—Clavus Angustus">Clavus Latus</head>

 <p> The <seg lang="la">clavus</seg> was a stripe of purple colour, worn by the Romans as a badge of distinction, and either sewn to the stuff or woven into it.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">latus clavus</hi> (broad stripe) was, according to tradition, introduced by Tullus Hostilius from the Etruscans ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 9.  136" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>ix. 136</bibl>). It was the distinctive badge of the senatorial order ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 6" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 28" default="NO"> Sat., 28</bibl>), and hence it is used to signify the senatorial dignity. In distinction to the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> it is called <seg lang="la">purpura maior</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  1. 106" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 106</bibl>), and the garment it decorated, <seg lang="la">tunica potens</seg> ( <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 5. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>v. 2</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 29</bibl>). Pliny speaks of this distinctive use as late ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 29</bibl>); yet its assumption by a <seg lang="la">praeco</seg>, the father of L. Aelius Stilo Praeconinus (whose official dress may have included the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg>), was, as he admits, remarkable, as was also its use by Horace's praetor of Fundi ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 36" default="NO"> Sat., 36</bibl>). But there were relaxations of the restriction: thus Augustus wore the <seg lang="la">tunica lati clavi</seg> before he assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>, and it was afterward his custom to permit the sons of senators to wear it and attend the discussions of the Senate in order to train them in public affairs. If they were entering on a military career, he also made them military tribunes and prefects. These youths were called <seg lang="la">laticlavii</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>38</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Aug. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. Aug., 94</bibl>); on the contrary, <seg lang="la">tribunus angusticlavius</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Otho 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Otho</title>, 10</bibl>). Wearing the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg> was also granted by the emperor as a favour to the sons of knights, as a preliminary step to their entering the Senate; if they relinquished or were disappointed in their hopes, they assumed the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 2" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>2</bibl>), but might again assume the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg>, like Priscus in Horace ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 7" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 7</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 10" default="NO"> Sat., 10</bibl>). In the later Empire the <seg lang="la">equites</seg> appear to have encroached on the rights of the Senate in this respect, and Alexander Severus was only able to insist that knights should be distinguished from senators by the quality of the purple employed (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 27). The Senate laid aside the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg> at times of mourning ( <bibl n="Liv.  9. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ix. 7</bibl>) and assumed the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> (Dio Cass. xxxviii. 14).</p>
 <p>The <ref type="cross" target="crossangustus-clavus">angustus clavus</ref> (narrow stripe) was a badge of the equestrian order (Vell. Paterc. ii. 88, 2), but less distinctively so than the golden ring ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 29</bibl>); for, as we shall see from the extant works of art, it was also worn by <seg lang="la">camilli, lanistae</seg>, <cb /> and others not of equestrian rank, as a part of their ceremonial dress.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Form</hi>.—It is agreed that the <seg lang="la">clavi</seg> were purple stripes woven in the fabric ( <bibl n="Quint.  8. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.viii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  28" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 28</bibl>) or sewn on it (<title>Dig.</title> 34, 2, 23. 1); that they were employed to ornament the tunic, and no other garment; that the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> consisted of two narrow vertical stripes falling from each shoulder, down the front, and, as appears from frescoes, also down the back. But there has been great discussion concerning the form of the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg>, some contending that it was a single stripe running down the centre of the bosom of the <seg lang="la">tunica</seg>, some that there were two stripes, only differing from the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> in breadth, and, like it, running down the back (as Marquardt maintains). The latter view is now generally held, although it is impossible to conclude the discussion by appealing to any representation of a senator displaying this <seg lang="la">ornamentum</seg>, as it was not the custom of ancient sculptors to indicate a distinction of colour by a conventional system of lines.</p>
 <p>It must be observed that <seg lang="la">latus clavus, angustus clavus</seg>, are often abbreviated expressions for <seg lang="la">tunica lati</seg> or <seg lang="la">angusti clavi.</seg> Thus Iulius Caesar is said to have worn a <seg lang="la">latus clavus ad manus fimbriatus</seg> ( <title>Iul.</title> 45). That the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> consisted of two stripes is proved by Quintilian, xi. 3, 138: <title>Cui lati clavi ius non erit, ita cingatur, ut tunicae prioribus oris infra genua paulum, posterioribus ad medios poplites usque perveniant . . . ut purpuriae recte descendant, levis cura est.</title> Though we cannot point to the representation of an <seg lang="la">eques</seg> wearing this garb, we find it frequently shown in Pompeian paintings of persons of inferior rank who are in ceremonial dress, especially <seg lang="la">camilli</seg> and other attendants on <figure id="fig.00364.2">
<head orig="Angustus Clavus. (From figures in the Catacombs.)">Angustus Clavus. (From figures in the Catacombs.)</head>
</figure> religious rites, and of <seg lang="la">lanistae.</seg> In a wallpainting at Pompeii belonging to the worship of the goddess Epona, the two <seg lang="la">camilli</seg> and a man leading mules wear the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus.</seg> The latter may be a muleteer especially adorned for a festival of the goddess, or a person of higher rank performing 
<pb n="365" /><cb />
 some rite of her worship (<title>Annali dell' Inst. Arch.</title> 1872, pl. D).</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg> probably survives in the <seg lang="la">clavi</seg> on the dalmatic, which was recognized as an ecclesiastical garb in the earlier part of the fourth century (<title>Vita Sylvestri I.</title>, p. 266, Combéfis), though down to A.D. 640 the <seg lang="la">clavi</seg> are always represented as black, according to Marriott (<title>Vestiarium Christianum</title>, p. lv.).</p>
 <p>Some writers maintain that the drawing below, representing Rome personified, clothed in a robe called <seg lang="la">cyclas</seg> (q. v.), shows the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg> falling in a broad purple stripe down the breast.</p>
 <p>It is true that the singular (<seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg>) is generally used, but this is also true of the <seg lang="la">angustus clavus</seg>, which confessedly consisted of two stripes; while the employment of the plural, <seg lang="la">latis clavis</seg>, is striking in a passage of Varro, which also insists on the resemblance of the two garments, by using as an illustration of an analogy a tunic, in which of the two pieces (front and back) one has the <seg lang="la">lati</seg>, the other the <seg lang="la">angusti, clavi</seg>. (<title>Non, si quis tunicam in usu ita</title> [E. Schulze, <seg lang="la">inusitate] consuit, ut altera plagula sit angustis clavis, altera latis, utraque pars in suo genere caret, analogia</seg> [<title>L. L.</title> ix. 79]. Cf. for the use of the plural, Festus, p. 209 a, 23: <seg lang="la">tunica autem palmata a latitudine clavorum dicebatur, quae nunc a genere picturae appellatur.</seg>) Again, Augustus, among other affectations of simplicity, <seg lang="la">usus est . . . clavo nec lato nec angusto</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>73</bibl>), which is quite intelligible if the two ornaments differed only in breadth, but inexplicable on the other hypothesis; while Herodian (v. 5, 9) speaks of the stripe down the centre of the tunic worn by the priests of the Sun, instituted by Elagabalus, as a Phoenician custom.</p>
 <p>As the tunic was composed of a front piece and a back piece sewn together, the passage quoted above from Varro goes to show that the <seg lang="la">lati clavi</seg> were worn down the back as well as down the front. In support of this may be cited Varro, <title>Sat. Menipp.</title> 313, Bücheler: <seg lang="la">quorum vitreae togae ostentant tunicae clavos</seg>, which refers to togas made of such diaphanous material that the <seg lang="la">clavi</seg> could be seen through them at the back. With the same intent of displaying this mark of distinction, the wearer of the <seg lang="la">tunica laticlavia</seg> is to gird himself so that it may fall low (<bibl n="Quint.  11.3.139" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.xi. 3.139</bibl>). <cb /> Pliny observes that in his time it was becoming a fashion to weave the <seg lang="la">tunica lati clavi</seg> of a stuff resembling <seg lang="la">gausapa</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8.  193" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>viii. 193</bibl>). The false derivation quoted from Festus above for <seg lang="la">palmata</seg> as applied to <seg lang="la">tunica</seg> may possibly indicate that the breadth of the <seg lang="la">latus clavus</seg> was about a palm.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κλέαρχος</foreign>). A Spartan, who distinguished himself in several important commands during the latter part of the Peloponnesian War, and at the close of it persuaded the Spartans to send him as a general to Thrace, to protect the Greeks in that quarter against the Thracians. But having been recalled by the ephors, and refusing to obey their orders, he was condemned to death. He thereupon crossed over to Cyrus, collected for him a large force of Greek mercenaries, and marched with him into Upper Asia, in B.C. 401, in order to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes, being the only Greek who was aware of the prince's real object. After the battle of Cunaxa and the death of Cyrus, Clearchus and the other Greek generals were made prisoners by the treachery of Tissaphernes, and were put to death.

<head orig="Clemens">Clemens</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κλήμης</foreign>). (1) Called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romānus</hi>, to distinguish him from Clemens of Alexandria. One of the early Christians, said by Origen to 
<pb n="366" /><cb />
 have been the friend and fellow-traveller of St. Paul, and afterwards bishop of Rome, to which station he was chosen A.D. 67, or, according to some, A.D. 91. He was the author of an epistle to the church of Corinth. Of this work, the only manuscript extant was in the British Museum until 1875, when Bryennios published a complete MS. of 1056 found at Constantinople; and in 1876, Cambridge University got possession of a Syriac MS. of the year 1170. Archbishop Wake printed a translation in 1705. The best edition of the original is that of Lightfoot <bibl default="NO">(1869; appendix 1877)</bibl>. See Cotterill, <bibl default="NO"><title>Modern Criticism</title> (Edinb. 1884)</bibl>. Clemens is supposed to have died at Rome about the close of the first century, though a legend of the ninth century makes him to have been martyred in the Crimea in A.D. 102. Besides the epistle mentioned above, there have been ascribed to Clemens two Syriac epistles on Virginity, the socalled <title>Clementinae</title> (“Recognitions” and “Homilies”), and several letters; but these may all be regarded as spurious.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">T. Flavius</hi>, a Father of the Church, who flourished between A.D. 190 and 217, and is commonly called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Alexandrīnus</hi>, to distinguish him from Clemens of Rome. He is supposed by some to have been a native of Athens, and by others of Alexandria, but of his real origin very little is known. He early devoted himself to study in the schools of the latter city, and had many preceptors. His Hebrew preceptor, whom he calls “the Sicilian bee,” was unquestionably Pantaenus, a Jew by birth, but of Sicilian extraction, who united Grecian with sacred learning, and was attached to the Stoic philosophy. Clemens so far adopted the ideas of this preceptor as to espouse the moral doctrine of the Stoics. In other respects he followed the Eclectic method of philosophizing. While the pagan philosophers pillaged the Christian stores to enrich the Eclectic system, this Christian father, on the contrary, transferred the Platonic, Stoic, and Oriental dogmas to the Christian creed, as relics of ancient tradition originating in Divine revelation. His most distinguished follower was Origen.</p>
 <p>In the hope of recommending Christianity to his catechumens, Clemens made a large collection of ancient wisdom, under the name of <title>Stromata</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Στρωματεῖς</foreign>, “patchwork”), and intended to denote the miscellaneous nature of the philosophical and religious topics of which the work treats. He assigned as a reason for the undertaking, that much truth is mixed with the dogmas of philosophers, or, rather, covered and concealed in their writings, like the kernel within its shell. This work is of great value, as it contains many quotations and relates many facts not elsewhere preserved. Besides the <title>Stromata</title>, we have the following works of Clemens remaining: <title>(a) Protrepticon</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Λόγος Προτρεπτικός</foreign>), or an exhortation to the Pagans; <title>(b) Paedagogus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Παιδαγωγός</foreign>), or the instructor; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the fragments of a treatise on the use of riches, entitled, “What rich man shall be saved?” The works of Clemens were first printed in Greek only, at Florence, in 1550. Of the various editions with Latin versions, the best is that of Archbishop Potter, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1715)</bibl>. A later edition is that of Klotz <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1834)</bibl>. A translation will be found in Clark's <bibl default="NO"><title>Ante-Nicene Library</title> (1877-79)</bibl>.

<head orig="Cleomĕnes">Cleomenes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κλεομένης</foreign>). (1) King of Sparta, ascended the throne B.C. 519. At the beginning of his reign he undertook an expedition against the Argives, defeated them, and destroyed a large number who had taken refuge in a sacred grove. He afterwards drove out the Pisistratidae from Athens. This is the same Cleomenes whom Aristagoras endeavoured, but in vain, to involve in a war with the Persians. He afterwards managed, by undue influence, to procure an oracular response from Delphi, pronouncing his colleague Demaratus illegitimate, and thus obtained his deposition. Becoming alarmed, subsequently, lest the fraud should be discovered, Cleomenes fled secretly to Thessaly, and from thence passing into Arcadia, he began to stir up the people of this latter country against Sparta. The Lacedaemonians, fearing his intrigues, recalled him, but he died soon after his return, in a fit of insanity, by his own hand ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 64</bibl>; v. 49 foll.; v. 65, etc.).</p>
 <p>(2) Cleomenes II., succeeded his brother Agesipolis II. on the throne of Sparta, B.C. 371. The power of his country was then on the decline, and he possessed not the requisite talents to restore it to its former state. He reigned sixty years and ten months without having done anything worthy the notice of posterity (Pausan. iii. 6).</p>
 <p>(3) Cleomenes III., son of Leonidas II., ascended the Spartan throne B.C. 236. Dissatisfied at the prevailing manners of Sparta, he resolved to bring about a reform, and to restore the institutions of Lycurgus, after the example of Agis , who had lost his life in a similar attempt. Thinking that war would furnish the best opportunity for the execution of his design, he led his forces against the Achaeans, who were commanded by Aratus, and greatly distinguished himself. Returning after this to Sparta, with a portion of his army, he put to death the Ephori, made a new division of the lands, and introduced again the old Spartan system of education. He also took his brother Euclidas as his colleague on the throne, and thus for the first and only time the Spartans had two kings of the same family. After a long, and in many respects successful, series of operations against the Achaeans and Macedonians, the latter of whom 
<pb n="367" /><cb />
 had been called in by Aratus as allies, Cleomenes was defeated by Antigonus in the battle of Sel<figure id="fig.00367">

</figure> lasia (B.C. 222), and immediately after fled to Ptolemy Euergetes in Egypt. This monarch treated him with some degree of generosity, but his successor, Ptolemy Philopator, a weak and suspicious prince, soon began to look upon him with an evil eye, and at last kept him in confinement. The Spartan monarch, in a fit of despair, and taking advantage of the temporary absence of Ptolemy from his capital, broke forth from the place where he had been kept in custody, along with thirteen of his friends, and endeavoured to arouse the inhabitants in the cause of freedom. But, finding their efforts fruitless, they fell by their own hands (B.C. 220).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κλέων</foreign>). An Athenian, the son of a tanner, and said himself to have exercised that trade. Of extraordinary impudence and little courage, slow in the field, but forward and noisy in the assembly, corrupt, but boastful of integrity, and supported by a coarse but ready eloquence, he gained such consideration by flattering the lower orders that he became the head of a party. By an extraordinary train of circumstances he came off victorious in the affair of <ref type="cross" target="crosssphacteria">Sphacteria</ref> (q.v.), the Athenian populace having chosen him one of their generals. Elated upon this with the idea that he possessed military talents, he caused himself to be appointed commander of an expedition into Thrace. He was slain in a battle at Amphipolis against Brasidas, the Spartan general, B.C. 422.</p>
 <p>It is probably unfortunate in the interest of historical truth that the accounts we have of Cleon's personality exist only in the writings of Thucydides and a partisan play, <title>The Knights</title>, of Aristophanes, both of whom were violently prejudiced against Cleon, the former personally and the latter politically.

 <p>(5) A daughter of Antiochus III. of Syria. She married Ptolemy V., king of Egypt, and was left guardian of her infant son Ptolemy VI., but she died soon after her husband, to the great regret of her subjects.</p>
 <p>(6) A daughter of Ptolemy Philometor, was the wife of three kings of Syria, and the mother of four—namely, of Antiochus Dionysius, by her first husband, Alexander Balas; of Seleucus V. and Antiochus VIII., by Demetrius Nicator; and, lastly, of Antiochus IX. , surnamed Cyzicenus, by Antiochus Euergetes or Sidetes. She was compelled by her son, Antiochus VIII., to drink the poison which she had prepared for him, B.C. 120.</p>
 <p>(7) The most famous of the name was the daughter of Ptolemy Auletes, and remarkable for her beauty and personal accomplishments. According to the usage of the Alexandrian court, she married her young brother, Ptolemy XII., and began to reign with him in her seventeenth year. Both she and her husband, being minors, were placed by the will of their father under the guardianship of Rome, an office which the Senate assigned to Pompey. An insurrection breaking out in the Egyptian capital soon after the commencement of this reign, Cleopatra was compelled to yield to the tide of popular fury, and to flee into Syria, where she sought protection in temporary exile. The flight of this princess, though mainly arising from the tumult just mentioned, was unquestionably accelerated by the designs of the young king and his ambitious ministers. Their object became manifest when Cleopatra , after a few months' residence in Syria, returned towards her native country to resume her seat on the throne. Ptolemy prepared to oppose her by force of arms, and a civil war would inevitably have ensued, had not Caesar at that very juncture sailed to the coast of Egypt in pursuit of Pompey. A curious interview soon took place between Cleopatra and the Roman general. She placed herself on board a small skiff, <figure id="fig.00367.2"><head>Cleopatra. (From a Composite Photograph of the Heads on four Egyptian Coins. Reproduced by permission from Gorringe's <title>Egyptian Obelisks.</title>) </head></figure> 
<pb n="368" /><cb />
 under the protection of Apollodorus, a Sicilian Greek, set sail from the coast of Syria, reached the harbour of Alexandria in safety, and had herself conveyed naked into the chamber of the Roman commander in the form of a large package of goods. The stratagem proved completely successful. Cleopatra was now in her twentieth year, distinguished by extraordinary personal charms, and surrounded with all the graces which give to those charms their greatest power. Her voice was extremely sweet, and she spoke a variety of languages with propriety and ease. She could, it is said, assume all characters at will, which all alike became her, and the impression that was made by her beauty was confirmed by the fascinating brilliancy of her conversation. The day after this singular meeting, Caesar summoned before him the king, as well as the citizens of Alexandria, and made arrangements for the restoration of peace, procuring Cleopatra , at the same time, her share of the throne. Pothinus, however, one of Ptolemy's ministers, in whose intriguing spirit all the dissensions of the court had originated, soon stirred up a second revolt, upon which the Alexandrian War commenced, in which Ptolemy was defeated and lost his life by drowning. Caesar now proclaimed Cleopatra queen of Egypt; but she was compelled to take her brother, the younger Ptolemy, who was only eleven years old, as her husband and colleague on the throne. The Roman general continued for some time at her court, and she bore him a son, called, from the name of his putative father, Caesarion. During the six years which immediately followed these events, the reign of Cleopatra seems not to have been disturbed by insurrection, nor to have been assailed by foreign war. When her brother, at the age of fourteen, demanded his share in the government, Cleopatra poisoned him, and remained sole possessor of the regal authority. The dissensions among the rival leaders who divided the power of Caesar had no doubt nearly involved her in a contest with both parties; but the decisive issue of the battle of Philippi relieved her from the hesitation under which some of her measures appear to have been adopted, and determined her inclinations, as well as her interests, in favour of the conquerors. To afford her an opportunity of explaining her conduct, Antony summoned her to attend him in Cilicia, and the meeting which she gave him on the river Cydnus has employed the pen, not only of the historian, but of the prince of English dramatists.</p>
 <p>The artifices of this fascinating princess, now in her twenty-seventh year, so far gained upon Antony as not only to divert his thoughts from his original purpose of subjecting her kingdom to the payment of tribute, but entirely to lull his ambition to sleep, and make him sacrifice his great stake as <cb /> a candidate for the empire of the world. After a fruitless attack upon the territory of Palmyra, he hastened to forget his disgrace in the society of the Egyptian queen, passing several months at Alexandria in the wildest and most delirious dissipation. The death of his wife, and his subsequent marriage with Octavia, delayed for a time the crisis which his ungoverned passions were preparing for him. But, though he had thus extricated himself from the snares of Alexandria, his inclinations too soon returned to that unlucky city; for we find that when he left Rome to proceed against the Parthians, he despatched in advance his friend Fonteius Capito to conduct Cleopatra into Syria. <figure id="fig.00368">
<head orig="Cleopatra.">Cleopatra.</head>
</figure> On his return from this disgraceful campaign, he incurred still deeper dishonour by once more willingly submitting to that bondage which had rendered him contemptible in the eyes of most of his followers.</p>
 <p>Passing over events which have been alluded to in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossaugustus-caesar">Augustus Caesar</ref>, we come to the period that followed the battle of Actium, at which the desertion of Cleopatra with her galleys and the pursuit of her by the infatuated Antony changed the destiny of the Roman Empire (B.C. 30). When Octavianus advanced against Egypt, and Antony had been a second time defeated under the walls of Alexandria, Cleopatra shut herself up with a few attendants 
<pb n="369" /><cb />
 and the most valuable part of her treasures in a strong building which appears to have been intended for a royal sepulchre. To prevent intrusion by friend or enemy she caused a report to be circulated that she had retired into the monument to put herself to death. Antony resolved to follow her example, and threw himself upon his sword; but being informed, before he expired, that Cleopatra was still living, he caused himself to be carried into her presence, and breathed his last in her arms. Octavianus, after this, succeeded in getting Cleopatra into his power, and the queen at first hoped to subdue him by her attractions; but finding at last that her efforts were unavailing, and suspecting that her life was spared only that she might grace the conqueror's triumph, she ended her days, if the common account is to be credited, by the bite of an asp; though some ascribed her death to poison administered internally. A small puncture in the arm was the only mark of violence which could be detected on the body of Cleopatra , and it was therefore believed that she had procured death either by the bite of a venomous reptile or by the use of a poisoned bodkin. She died in her thirty-ninth year, having reigned twenty-two years from the death of her father. Octavianus, it is said, though deprived by this act of suicide of the greatest ornament of his approaching triumph, gave orders that she should have a magnificent funeral, and that her body, as she desired, should be laid by that of Antony. Her two children by Antony were reared by the neglected wife Octavia.</p>
 <p>The name of Cleopatra has been linked by romance and poetry with those of the most fascinating women the world has seen—Helen of Troy, Mary Stuart, and Ninon de Lenclos—and has always exercised a powerful influence upon the imagination of men. In English literature the genius of Shakespeare and of Dryden has made her story the theme of dramas; while the resources of art have been exhausted to produce types that should satisfy the eye and the mind of the critic.

 <p> The name originally applied to such inhabitants of Rome as had lost or given up the citizenship of their own cities, and had settled in Roman territory. Here, having no legal rights, they were compelled, in order to secure their personal freedom, to seek the protection of some Roman citizen, a term which, in ancient times, could mean only a patrician. The relation thus set on foot was called <seg lang="la">clientela</seg>, and was inherited by the descendants of both parties. Accordingly the client entered into the family of his patron (<seg lang="la">patronus</seg>), took his gentile name, and was admitted to take part in the family sacrifices. The patron made over to him a piece of land as a means of support, protected him from violence, represented him at law, and buried him after his death. The client, on his part, accompanied his patron abroad and on military service, gave his advice in legal and domestic matters, and made a contribution from his property if his patron were endowing a daughter, or had to be ransomed in war or to pay a fine. The relation between patron and client is also illustrated by the fact that neither party could bring an action against the other in a court of law, or bear witness against him, or vote against him, or appear against him as advocate. A man's duty to his client was more binding than his duty to his blood relations, and any violation of it was regarded as a capital offence.</p>
 <p>When Servius Tullius extended the rights of citizenship to the clients as well as to the plebeians, the bond between patron and client still continued in force, although it gradually relaxed with the course of time. At the end of the republican age the <seg lang="la">status</seg> of client, in the proper sense of the word, had ceased to exist. Under the Empire the <seg lang="la">clientela</seg> was a mere external relation between the rich and the poor, the great and the obscure. It involved no moral obligation on either side, but was based merely on the vanity of the one party and the necessity of the other. It was no unusual thing to find persons who had no settled means of subsistence trying, by flattery and servile behaviour, to win the favour of the great. Even philosophers and poets, like Statius and 
<pb n="370" /><cb /> Martial, are found in this position. The client performed certain services, called on his patron in the morning, accompanied him on public occasions, and was in turn invited to his table, received presents from him, and (if he could get it) a settled provision. Instead of inviting their numerous clients, the rich would often present them with a small sum of money called <seg lang="la">sportula.</seg> The relation was entirely a free one, and could be dissolved at pleasure by either party.</p>
 <p>In the republican age whole communities, and even provinces, when they had submitted to the Roman yoke, would sometimes become clients of a single <seg lang="la">patronus.</seg> In this case the <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> would usually be the conquering general. Marcellus, for instance, the conqueror of Syracuse, and his descendants, were patrons of Sicily. The practical advantages which were secured to a foreign community by this permanent representation at Rome are obvious. Accordingly we find that, under the Empire, even cities which stood to Rome in no relation of dependence, such as colonies and <seg lang="la">municipia</seg>, sometimes selected a <seg lang="la">patronus.</seg> The <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> was, in such cases, always chosen from among the senators or <seg lang="la">equites.</seg> See Mommsen, <title>Abhandlung über das römische Gastrecht und die römische Clientel</title> (in <title>Römische Forschungen</title>) <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1864-79)</bibl>; McLennan, <bibl default="NO"><title>The Patriarchal Theory</title> (London, 1885)</bibl>; and Morey, <bibl default="NO"><title>Outlines of Roman Law</title> (New York, 1889)</bibl>.

<head orig="Clima">Clima</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κλίμα</foreign>). Literally “a slope” or “inclination”; a term used in the mathematical geography of the Greeks with reference to the inclination of various parts of the earth's surface to the plane of the equator. Before the globular figure of the earth was known, it was supposed that there was a general slope of its surface from south to north, and this was called <foreign lang="greek">κλίμα</foreign>. But as the science of mathematical geography advanced, the word was applied to different belts of the earth's surface, which were determined by the different lengths of the longest day at their lines of demarcation. This division into climates was applied only to the northern hemisphere, as the geographers had no practical knowledge of the earth south of the equator. The term <foreign lang="greek">κλίμα</foreign> was afterwards applied to the temperature of these belts; hence the meaning of the modern word <seg lang="la">climate.</seg></p>
 <p>Hipparchus (about B.C. 160) seems to have been the first who made use of this division; his system is explained at length by Strabo (ii. p. 132).</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">clima</seg> is found only in the later Latin, the pure Latin term being <seg lang="la">inclinatio, declinatio</seg>, or <seg lang="la">devergentia.</seg>

<head orig="Clipeus">Clipeus</head>

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Clipeum</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσπίς, σάκος</foreign>). (1) The large shield used by the Greeks and the Romans, originally of circular shape, said to have been first used by Proetus and Acrisius of Argos (Pausan. ii. 25. 6); and therefore called <title>clipeus Argolicus</title> According to other accounts, however, it was derived from the Egyptians ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 180" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 180</bibl>).</p>
 <p>One of the earliest extant representations of Greek shields is to be found in the engraving on a sword-blade found at Mycenae, representing a 
<pb n="371" /><cb />
 combat between men and lions (Helbig, <title>Homerische Epos</title>, p. 232). It will be seen that some of the men carry shields resembling a <seg lang="la">scutum</seg>, others shields which recall the shape of the Boeotian shield, and that each form covers about three quarters of the person, and is partly supported by a strap passing round the shoulders. <figure id="fig.00371">
<head orig="Early Representation of Greek Shields. (Helbig.)">Early Representation of Greek Shields. (Helbig.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The heroes of the <title>Iliad</title> carry a shield which is round (iii. 347) and large enough to cover the whole man (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιβρότη, ποδηνεκής</foreign>). It is composed by sewing together circular pieces of untanned ox-hide, varying in number. These are strengthened on both sides by plates of bronze, the outer hides and plates being of smaller diameter, so that on the edge of the shield both hide and metal are thinnest ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 20. 275" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xx. 275</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Sarpedon's shield is forged of plates of bronze, to which ox-hides are attached on the inside by golden rods or bolts (<foreign lang="greek">ῥάβδοι</foreign>) running all round the circle. Ten circles of bronze run round Agamemnon's shield. Achilles' shield is composed entirely of metal in five plates—two of bronze, two of tin, and a central one of gold. The structure is bound together by a metal rim (<foreign lang="greek">ἄντυξ</foreign>), which in Achilles' shield is triple. At the centre of the shield is a metal boss (<foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign>). Agamemnon's shield is studded with twenty bosses of tin and a central one of <hi rend="italic">cyanus</hi> ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 34</bibl>).</p>
 <p>When not in use the shield was suspended by the <foreign lang="greek">τελαμών</foreign>, which passed around the breast, the shield hanging at the back. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbalteus">Balteus</ref>.) The practice of decorating the shield had commenced in the Homeric Age ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 36" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 36</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In later times the shields were smaller, usually covering the warrior from the neck to the knees only. Besides the circular or Argive shield, we frequently find mentioned one of an oval shape with a strong rim and apertures in the middle of <figure id="fig.00371.2">
<head orig="Greek Shield. (Tischbein.)">Greek Shield. (Tischbein.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> each side (Eurip. <bibl default="NO"><title>Phoeniss.</title> 1386</bibl>). This is known as the Boeotian shield.</p>
 <p>The shield was at last formed entirely of brass (<foreign lang="greek">πάγχαλκος</foreign>), and a sort of apron, probably of leather or some thick material, was sometimes attached to it, especially when one did not wear greaves to protect his legs. The simplest arrangement to hold the shield consisted of two metal handles, one to pass the arm through and one to grasp with the hand; but the more elaborate arrangement is shown in the illustration from a terra-cotta vase published by Tischbein (iv. tab. 20). In it the broad band that runs across the shield like the diameter of a circle is of metal, the thong about the edge of the rim of leather (<foreign lang="greek">πόρπαξ</foreign>).</p>
 <p>At the close of a war it was customary for the Greeks to suspend their shields in the temples, when the <foreign lang="greek">πόρπακες</foreign> were taken off, in order to render them unserviceable in case of any sudden or popular outbreak. Sometimes shields were kept in a case (<foreign lang="greek">σάγμα</foreign>), ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 574" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Ach.</title>574</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The <foreign lang="greek">ἀσπίς</foreign> was the characteristic defensive weapon (<foreign lang="greek">ὅπλον</foreign>) of the heavy-armed infantry (<foreign lang="greek">ὁπλῖται</foreign>) during the historical times of Greece, and is opposed to the lighter <foreign lang="greek">πέλτη</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γέρρον</foreign>; hence we find the word <foreign lang="greek">ἀσπίς</foreign> used to signify a body of <foreign lang="greek">ὁπλῖται</foreign> ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1. 7. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Anab.</title>i. 7. 10</bibl>). It was distinctively a Greek shield, and thus none of the Eastern peoples who served under Xerxes ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 61</bibl> foll.) were armed with it.</p>
 <p>The Roman <seg lang="la">clipeus</seg> is seen in the accompanying illustration from the Column of Trajan. According <figure id="fig.00371.3">
<head orig="Clipeus, Roman Shield. (Column of Trajan.)">Clipeus, Roman Shield. (Column of Trajan.)</head>
</figure> to Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 1.43" default="NO" valid="yes">i. 43</bibl>), when the census was instituted by Servius Tullius, the first class only used the clipeus, and the second were armed with the <seg lang="la">scutum</seg> (q. v.); but after the Roman soldier received pay, the clipeus was discontinued altogether for the Sabine <seg lang="la">scutum</seg> ( <bibl n="Liv.  8. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.viii. 8</bibl>; cf. ix. 19;  <bibl n="Plut. Rom. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Rom.</title>21</bibl>; <title>Eclog.</title> xxiii. 3, who asserts that the original form of the Roman shield was square, and that it was subsequently changed for that of the Tyrrhenians, which was round).</p>
 <p>The emblazoning of shields with devices (<foreign lang="greek">σήματα, σημεῖα</foreign>) was said to be derived from the Carians ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 171" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 171</bibl>). The bearings on the shields of the heroes before Thebes, as described by Aeschylus in the <title>Seven against Thebes</title>, exhibit the development of devices in post-Homeric times. Some shields, like Agamemnon's, bear subjects designed to strike terror; to that of Tydeus bronze bells are attached with the same object. Other subjects are purely mythological or indicate the owner's ancestry. This custom of emblazoning shields is illustrated on a very beautiful gem from the antique, in which the figure of Victory is represented inscribing upon a clipeus the name or merits of some deceased hero.</p>
 <p>From the historians we find that while an individual sometimes attracted attention by an unusual device, 
<pb n="372" /><cb />
 cities made use of some common symbol for their shields which might be easily recognizable by their friends: thus the Lacedaemonians used <foreign lang="greek">Λ</foreign>, the Sicyonians <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>, the Thebans Heracles's club—a practice of which the enemy sometimes took a treacherous advantage ( <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 4. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Hell.</title>iv. 4</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Hell. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. Hell., 10</bibl>; vii. 50; Pausan. iv. 58, 5).</p>
 <p>Each Roman soldier also had his own name and a mark indicating his cohort inscribed upon his shield, in order that he might readily find his own when the order was given to unpile arms (Veget. ii. 17), and sometimes the name of the commander under whom he fought ( <title>Bell. Alex.</title> 58).</p>
 <p>Victorious armies sometimes dedicated their own shields or an engraved shield of gold as an offering in a temple ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 92</bibl>). For decorative purposes, shields in metal or marble were often suspended from the roofs of porticoes or in the <seg lang="la">atria</seg> of private houses. See M.

From the time of his first arrival in Athens he attached himself to <ref type="cross" target="crosscarneades">Carneades</ref> (q.v.), and continued his disciple until his death, when he became his successor in the academic chair. He studied with great industry and made himself master of the systems of the other schools, but professed the doctrine of suspension of assent, as it had been taught by his master. Cicero relates that he wrote four hundred books upon philosophical subjects. At an advanced age he was seized with a lethargy. Recovering in some measure the use of his faculties, he said, “The love of life shall deceive me no longer,” and laid violent hands upon himself. He entered, as we have said, upon the office of preceptor in the Academy immediately after the death of Carneades, and held it thirty years. According to Cicero, he taught that there is no certain criterion by which to judge of the truth of those reports which we receive from the senses, and that, therefore, a wise man will either wholly suspend his assent, or decline giving a peremptory opinion; but that, nevertheless, men are strongly impelled by nature to follow probability. His moral doctrine established a natural alliance between pleasure and virtue. He was a professed enemy to rhetoric, and thought that no place should be allowed in society to so dangerous an art.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπόνομος</foreign>). A sewer, or drain. Drains for the removal of a city's sewage are of very great 
<pb n="373" /><cb />
 antiquity, since at Nineveh excavations show a very complete system of sewers; while the same is true of Athens, where the remains of the ancient drains have been carefully described by Ziller (<bibl default="NO"><title>Mittheil. des deutsch. Inst. in Athen</title> (1877)</bibl>, pp. 117-119).</p>
 <p>The sewers of ancient Rome were much admired in ancient times, and were classed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus with the aqueducts and roads as the best proof of the greatness and magnificence of the Roman Empire (iii. 67) Many of the Roman cities in northern Italy and in Gaul still show remains of similar cloacae.</p>
 <p>The chief of the ancient Roman sewers still existing is the famous Cloaca Maxima, running from the valley of the Subura at the foot of the Carinae, across the Forum under the south end of the Basilica Iulia, where it is exposed to view, and entering the river Tiber, near the Temple of Hercules in the Forum Boarium, by an arch of peperino shown in the illustration. The original dimensions of <figure id="fig.00373">
<head orig="Present Condition of the Cloaca Maxima.">Present Condition of the Cloaca Maxima.</head>
</figure> the arch were 12 ft. 4 in. in height, and 10 ft. 8 in. in width, but one-third of its height is now choked up by mud.</p>
 <p>Another sewer, which like the Cloaca Maxima is still in use, enters the Tiber opposite to the Insula Tiberina. Its antiquity is very great, and it is constructed of large blocks of peperino uncemented. In the quay wall not far from the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima may be seen two smaller arched openings, one of which is now dry, the other discharges the waters of the Aqua Crabra.</p>
 <p>M. Agrippa, during his aedileship, in B.C. 36, showed great zeal in the supervision of the cloacae, traversing them in a boat and cleansing them at his own expense (Dio Cass. xlix. 43). He constructed a cloaca to drain the Campus Martius, which was connected with the Thermae of Agrippa and the Aqua Virgo. This was discovered under Urban VIII., and is at present in use under the name of the Chiavica della Rotonda.</p>
 <p>The discoveries made at various times show that the network of smaller drains communicating with these main cloacae still exists, though in great part choked up. Brick is largely used in their construction; sometimes they are covered in with a barrel vault, sometimes by two tiles leaning against each other, sometimes by a single flagstone, but in some cases we find a primitive arrangement <cb /> of projecting courses of stone which was observed in the drains of Athens.</p>
 <p>The expense of cleansing and repairing these cloacae was, of course, very great, and was defrayed partly by the treasury and partly by an assessment called <seg lang="la">cloacarium.</seg> Under the Republic the administration of the sewers was intrusted to the censors and aediles; but under the Empire particular officers were appointed for that purpose, <seg lang="la">cloacarum curatores</seg>, mention of whom is found in inscriptions. Under the Empire condemned criminals were employed in cleansing the cloacae. ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 10. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>x. 44</bibl>[41].) Theodoric appointed an official to repair the drains, a striking instance of the esteem in which the barbarians held Roman civilization.</p>

 <p>A noted Roman demagogue, the enemy of Cicero. He first appears in history as an officer of Lucullus in Asia (B.C. 70). In the following year he accused Catiline of extortion in Africa, but was bribed to abandon the prosecution. In B.C. 62, he was alleged to have had an intrigue with Pompeia, the wife of Iulius Caesar, 
<pb n="374" /><cb />
 to meet whom he profaned the rites of the Bona Dea by entering the house of Caesar where they were being held; but was detected by Caesar's mother, and subsequently tried for sacrilege, but escaped conviction by lavish bribery. It was because of this affair that Caesar divorced his wife, with the famous remark that those of his household must be above suspicion ( <title>Iul.</title> 74). At the trial Clodius had attempted to prove an alibi, but Cicero's evidence showed that Clodius was with him in Rome only three hours before he pretended to have been at Interamna. In order to revenge himself upon Cicero, Clodius caused himself to be adopted into a plebeian family, that he might obtain the formidable power of a tribune of the plebs. As tribune in 58, supported by the triumvirs Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, he drove Cicero into exile; but, notwithstanding all his efforts, he was unable to prevent the recall of Cicero in the following year. In 56, Clodius was aedile, and attempted to bring his enemy, T. Milo, to trial. Each had gladiators in his pay, and frequent fights took place in the streets of Rome between the two parties. At the time when Clodius was a candidate for the praetorship and Milo for the consulship, on the 20th of January, B.C. 52, on the Via Appia, near Bovillae, an affray ensued between their followers, in which Clodius was killed. The mob was infuriated at the death of its favourite; and such tumults followed at the burial of Clodius that Pompey was appointed sole consul (<seg lang="la">consul sine collega</seg>), in order to restore order to the State.

<head orig="Cloelia">Cloelia</head>

 <p> A Roman virgin, given as a hostage to Porsenna. According to the old Roman legend, when Porsenna and the Romans made a peace after the affair of Mucius <ref type="cross" target="crossscaevola">Scaevola</ref> (q.v.), the latter people gave hostages to the king—ten youths and ten maidens, children of noble parents—as a pledge that they would truly keep the peace which had been proclaimed. It happened, as the camp of the Etrurians was near the Tiber, that Cloelia, one of the maidens, escaped with her companions and fled to the brink of the river; and, as the Etrurians pursued them, they all rushed into the water and swam in safety across the stream. But the Romans, jealous of their reputation for good faith, sent them all back to the camp of Porsenna. Not to be outdone in generosity, the monarch gave her and her female companions their freedom, and permitted her to take with her half of the youths; whereupon, with the delicacy of a Roman maiden, she selected those only who were of tender years. The Romans raised an equestrian statue in her honour on the highest part of the Via Sacra ( <bibl n="Liv.  2. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ii. 13</bibl>). There is another story, that Tarquinius fell upon the hostages as they were conducted into the Etrurian camp, and with the exception of Valeria, who fled back to the city, massacred them all ( <bibl n="Plin.  34. 13" default="NO">Plin.xxxiv. 13</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κνίδος</foreign>). A town and promontory of Doris in Caria, at the extremity of a promontory called Triopium. The founder of the place is said to have been Triopas. From him it received at first the name of Triopium, which at a later period was confined merely to the promontory on which it stood ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 174" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 174</bibl>). Aphrodité was the chief deity of the place, and had three temples erected to her, under the several surnames of Doritis, Acraea, and Euploea. In the last of these stood a celebrated statue of the goddess, the work of Praxiteles (Pausan. i. 1; <bibl n="Plin.  36. 5" default="NO">Plin.xxxvi. 5</bibl>). Nicomedes of Bithynia wished to purchase this admirable production of the chisel, and actually offered to liquidate the debt of Cnidus, which was very considerable, if the citizens would cede it to him; but they refused to part with what they esteemed the glory of their city ( Plin. l. c.). Off Cnidus took place in B.C. 394 a famous sea-fight between the Athenians, under Conon , and the Spartans, under Pisander, in which the former were victorious. The shores of Cnidus furnished in ancient times, as they do now, a great abundance of fish. The wines were famous, and Theophrastus speaks of the Cnidian onions as of a particular species, being very mild and not occasioning tears. Cnidus was the birthplace of the famous mathematician and astronomer Eudoxus; of Agatharchidas, Theopompus, and Ctesias. Excavations made at Cnidus in 1857- 58 led to the discovery of many fine marbles, some of which may now be seen in the British Museum.

 <p>(1) A screw, one of the mechanical powers, so named from its spiral form, which resembles the worming of a shell. The annexed illustration represents a clothes-press, from a painting on the wall of the Chalcidicum of Eumachia at Pompeii, which <figure id="fig.00376">

The thread of the screw; for which the Latin language has no appropriate term, is called <foreign lang="greek">περικόχλιον</foreign> in Greek.
 </p>
 <p>(2) A spiral pump for raising water, invented by Archimedes, from whom it has ever since been called the Archimedean screw. It is described at length by Vitruvius (x. 11). A pump of this kind was used for discharging the bilge-water in the ship of Hiero, which was built under the directions of Archimedes.
 </p>
 <p>(3) A peculiar kind of door, through which the wild beasts passed from their dens into the arena of the amphitheatre. It consisted of a circular cage, open on one side like a lantern, which worked upon a pivot and within a shell, like the machines used in the convents and foundling hospitals of Italy, termed <hi rend="italic">rote</hi>, so that any particular beast could be removed from its den into the arena merely by turning it round, and without the possibility of more than one escaping at the same time; and therefore it is recommended by Varro as peculiarly adapted for an aviary, so that a <cb /> person could go in and out without affording the birds an opportunity of flying away. Schneider, however, maintains that the <seg lang="la">coclea</seg> in question was nothing more than a portcullis (<seg lang="la">cataphracta</seg>) raised by a screw, which interpretation does not appear so probable as the one given above.

When the bridge was destroyed, Cocles, after addressing a short prayer to the god of the Tiber, leaped into the stream, and swam across in safety with his arms. As a mark of gratitude, every inhabitant, while famine was raging within the city, brought him all the provisions he could stint himself of; and the State afterwards raised a statue to him and gave him as much land as he could plough round in a day ( <bibl n="Liv.  2. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ii. 10</bibl>).

A word originally signifying the trunk or stem of a tree ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 2. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>ii. 30</bibl>), and hence used to designate anything composed of pieces of wood.</p>
 <p>(1) A log of wood, attached as a punishment to the feet of slaves, which they dragged with them, and on which they also sat sometimes (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poen.</title>v. 3</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Poen. 39" default="NO" valid="yes"> Poen., 39</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) Boats on the Tiber, which may originally have been like the Indian canoes, or were constructed of several roughly hewn planks nailed together in a rude and simple manner, were called <seg lang="la">naves caudicariae</seg>, or <hi rend="italic">codicariae</hi>, or <seg lang="la">caudiceae</seg> ( Fest. p. 46 M.; Varr., Sall. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. p. 535<bibl n="Non.  13" default="NO" valid="yes">Non., 13</bibl>; <title>Brev. Vit.</title> 13, 4). The surname of Caudex given to Appius Claudius must be traced to this signification. In later times the name was given to ships employed in transporting the corn from Ostia to Rome; and the sailors engaged in this traffic, called <seg lang="la">caudicarii</seg> or <seg lang="la">codicarii</seg>, formed a corporation.
 </p>
 <p>(3) The name of <hi rend="italic">codex</hi> was given to wooden tablets bound together and lined with a coat of wax, for the purpose of writing upon them; and when, at a later age, parchment or paper or other materials were substituted for wood, and put together in the shape of a book, the name of <hi rend="italic">codex</hi> was often used as synonymous with <seg lang="la">liber</seg>, or book ( <title>Verr.</title> i. 46. 119). It was the name more particularly given to an account-book or ledger, <seg lang="la">codex accepti et expensi</seg> (q. v.). In the time of Cicero we find it also applied to the tablet on which a bill was written. At a still later period, during the time of the emperors, the word was used to express any collection of laws or constitutions of the emperors, whether made by private individuals or by public authority. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscodex-gregorianus">Codex Gregorianus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscodex-iustinianeus">Codex Iustinianeus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscodex-theodosianus">Codex Theodosianus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The word <hi rend="italic">codex</hi> is largely used by scholars of the MS. editions of the classics that are preserved in the libraries of Europe, and date some from the fifth to the tenth centuries A.D., but the greater number from the thirteenth to the fifteenth. They are of parchment (folio or quarto size), usually with marginal notes written by other hands than those of the original copyist of the codex. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliber">Liber</ref>; Palaeography; <ref type="cross" target="crosstextual-criticism">Textual Criticism</ref>.) They are named (1) after persons who once owned them, as the Codex Petavinus of Ovid, named after one Petavius, and the Codex Vossianus of the same classic, after Voss; and</p>
 <p>(2) more commonly after the places where they are kept. Thus there are in <hi rend="SmallCaps">England</hi>, Codices Britannici or Londinenses (British Museum), Codices Cantabrigienses (Cambridge), and Codices Oxonienses (Oxford). These last are also often noted as Codices Bodleiani (from the Bodleian Library). In <ref type="cross" target="crossfrance">France</ref>, one finds Codices Parisini (Paris), Codices Bliandifontani (Fontaineblean), Codices Sangermanenses (St. Germain), Codices Montepessulani (Montpellier), etc. In <hi rend="SmallCaps">Holland</hi>, there are Codices Amstelodamienses (Amsterdam) and Codices Leidenses (Leyden); in <ref type="cross" target="crossbelgium">Belgium</ref>, Codices Bruxellenses (Brussels) and Codices Blandiniani (Blankenberg); in <cb /> <hi rend="SmallCaps">Denmark</hi>, Codices Haunienses (Copenhagen); in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Switzerland</hi>, Codices Bernenses (Berne), Codices Basilienses (Bâle), Codices Einsidlenses (Einsiedeln), Codices Sangallenses (St. Gallen), and Turicenses (Zürich); in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Germany</hi>, Codices Argentoratenses (Strassburg), Codices Berolinenses (Berlin), Codices Colonienses (Cologne), Codices Palatini (Heidelberg), Codices Fuldenses (Fulda), Codices Caroliruhenses (Carlsruhe), Codices Regiomontani (Königsberg), Codices Guelferbytani (Wolfenbüttel), Codices Monacenses (Munich), Codices Lipsienses (Leipzig), and Codices Vratislavienses (Breslau), etc.; in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Austria</hi>, Codices Vindobonenses (Vienna) and Codices Budenses (Buda); in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Russia</hi>, Codices Petropolitani (St. Petersburg); in <hi rend="SmallCaps">Spain</hi>, Codices Matritenses (Madrid) and Codices Toletani (Toledo). In <hi rend="SmallCaps">Italy</hi>, the terminology is varied. The great collections are at (1) Florence, in the Bibliotheca Laurentiana of the Church of San Lorenzo, comprising MSS. from the Public Library of San Marco founded by Cosimo de' Medici, and from the collection of Peter Leopold. Hence Florentine codices are styled variously, Florentini, Laurentiani, S. Marci, Medicei, and Leopoldini Laurentiani;</p>
 <p>(2) Milan, where the codices are called either Mediolanenses, from the name of the city, or Ambrosiani, from the Ambrosian Library;</p>
 <p>(3) Venice, where they are called Veneti, or (from the Library of St. Mark) Veneti Marciani, or simply Marciani;</p>
 <p>(4) Turin, Codices Taurinenses;</p>
 <p>(5) Verona, Codices Veronenses;</p>
 <p>(6) Rome, where the great storehouse is the Vatican Library (Bibliotheca Vaticana), enriched by MSS. from many sources—e. g. from Fulvius Orsini, from Heidelberg, from the Library of Urbino, etc. Hence the Codices Vaticani often receive names to specify more particularly their original sources, as Codices Ursiniani, Codices Palatini, Codices Urbinates, etc.</p>
 <p>(7) Naples, where the codices are called Neapolitani, or (from the old Bourbon Library) Borbonici. A complete list of Latin MSS. down to the seventh century is given by Prof. Hübner, in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Grundriss z. Geschichte u. Encycl. der Klass.

It comprised enactments of the emperors between Septimius Severus (A.D. 195-211) and Diocletian and Maximian (A.D. 285-305), and possibly even some as far back as Hadrian (A.D. 117-138). It was divided into at least thirty books—the books being subdivided into “titles” and “rubrics,” the topics being arranged after the order of the Perpetual Edict of Salvius Iulianus.

<div2 id="crosscodex-iustinianeus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Codex Iustinianēus">Codex Iustinianeus</head>

 <p> The motives by which the emperor Justinian was induced to codify the enactments of himself and earlier emperors were the scarcity of copies of the Code of Theodosius, and the consequent divergence between the law there laid down and that actually applied in the courts (<title>Cod.</title> i. 17, 2, 17). Accordingly, in February, A.D. 528, he appointed a commission of codification of ten persons, among them being Tribonianus, who played so important a part in the legislative work of the next few years, and who perhaps suggested to his master his whole scheme of legal reform. Their instructions were to compile a single code out of those of Gregorianus, Hermogenianus, and Theodosius II., and the imperial constitutions issued since the enactment of the last, whether by Justinian himself or his predecessors. They were authorized to omit all that was unnecessary or superfluous (e. g. preambles), to reconcile such enactments as were inconsistent with one another, and, where convenience required, to combine several into one, or to make any alterations in individual constitutions which they should deem necessary. The separate laws, whether technically <seg lang="la">edicta, rescripta</seg>, or <seg lang="la">decreta</seg>, were to be arranged in chronological order under generic titles; and each, so far as was possible, identified by date and the name of the prince to whom it owed its enactment. The work was completed in April, A.D. 529, and was published under the name Codex Iustinianeus, with force of law from the 16th of that month. The older codices and constitutions were at the same time deprived of all validity, and it was even forbidden to appeal to any <seg lang="la">leges</seg> cited in the writings of the jurists if they had been incorporated, even in a modified form, in the new code.</p>
 <p>In the interval of four years and a half between this date and the completion of the Institutes (November, A.D. 533), Justinian had issued a large number of new constitutions of his own. This seemed to him to necessitate a revision of the Codex. Accordingly in the next year he appointed a new commission, consisting of Tribonianus, Dorotheus, professor at Berytus, and three others, for this purpose. Within a few months (November, A.D. 534) the original code and the constitutions issued after its enactment were deprived of all authority and withdrawn from circulation, their place being taken by the <title>Codex Repetitae Praelectionis</title>, or <cb /> Codex which has come down to us. In this Justinian's own constitutions were incorporated, as well as many others which the earlier code had not contained. The <title>Codex Repetitae Praelectionis</title> consists of twelve books, each of which is divided into “titles” and “rubrics”; the single constitutions are arranged under their several titles in the order of time and with the names of the emperors by whom they were respectively made, and their dates.</p>
 <p>The enactments in this code do not go further back than those of Hadrian, and those of his immediate successors are few in number. The arrangement corresponds tolerably closely with that of the Digest, the seven parts into which the fifty books of the latter are distributed answering to books i.-ix. of the code; but the matter of the last three books of the code is hardly treated of in the Digest.

 <p> In A.D. 429, Theodosius II., whose capital was Constantinople, communicated to the Senate his resolution to form a compilation of the general constitutions issued from the time of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) to his own day, after the model of the Codices Gregorianus and Hermogenianus; and appointed a commission of a lawyer and eight State officials to execute the scheme. Nothing, however, was done for six years. In A.D. 435, a new commission was appointed, presided over, like the earlier one, by Antiochus, and the imperial instructions were repeated. The result of their labours, known as the Theodosian Code, was published in February, A.D. 438, with statutory force from January 1 in the following year.</p>
 <p>The constitutions are arranged in chronological order, under “titles” and “rubrics,” in sixteen books. The first five, which contain most of the enactments relating to private law, are in form modelled on the commentaries on the The sixth to the eighth books consist principally of administrative and constitutional ordinances; the ninth is criminal law; the tenth and eleventh relate to the financial system, and in part to procedure; the twelfth to the fifteenth, to the constitution and administration of towns and other corporations; and the sixteenth contains the constitutions which deal with the Church and the ecclesiastical system in general.</p>
 <p>Our knowledge of this code is derived partly from incomplete MSS., partly from the code of Justinian, and partly from an epitome of its contents in the <title>Breviarium</title> (q. v.). The valuable edition of Gothofredus J. <bibl default="NO">(6 vols. Leyden, 1665, re-edited by Ritter, Leipzig, 1736-45)</bibl> contained the code in its complete form, except the first five books, for which it was necessary to use the epitome just referred to. This is also the case with the edition of this code contained in the <title>Ius Civile Anteiustinianeum</title> of Berlin <bibl default="NO">(1815)</bibl>. But the discovery of a MS. of the <title>Breviarium</title> at Milan in 1820 by Clossius, and of a palimpsest of the Theodosian Code at Turin by Peyron, has contributed largely both to the critical knowledge of the other parts of this code, and has added numerous genuine constitutions to the first five books, especially Book i. Haenel's discoveries have added also to our knowledge of the later books, and his edition of the Theodosian Code <bibl default="NO">(1842-44)</bibl> is the latest and the best.

<head orig="Codrus">Codrus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κόδρος</foreign>). The last king of Athens. He received the sceptre from his father Melanthus, and was far advanced in years when some of the Dorian States united their forces for the invasion of Attica. The Dorian army marched to Athens and lay encamped under its walls; and the oracle at Delphi had assured them of success, provided they spared the life of the Athenian king. A friendly Delphian, named Cleomantis, disclosed the answer of the oracle to the Athenians, and Codrus resolved to devote himself for his country in a manner not unlike that which immortalized among the Romans, at a later date, the name of the Decii. He went out at the gate disguised in a woodman's garb, and falling in with two Dorians, killed one with his bill, and was killed by the other. The Athenians thereupon sent a herald to claim the body of their king, and the Dorian chiefs, deeming the war hopeless, withdrew their forces from Attica. After the death of Codrus, the nobles, taking advantage, perhaps, of the opportunity afforded by a dispute between his sons, are said to have abolished the title of King, and to have substituted for it that of Archon. This new office was to be held for life, and then transmitted to the son of the deceased. The first of these hereditary archons was Medon, son of Codrus, from whom the thirteen following archons were called Medontidae, as being his lineal descendants.

 <p> A division of the Roman army. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossexercitus">Exercitus</ref>). In the republican age the word was especially applied to the divisions contributed by the Italian allies. Down to B.C. 89, when the Italians obtained the Roman citizenship, they were bound to supply an infantry contingent to each of the two consular armies, which consisted of two legions apiece. This contingent numbered in all 10,000 infantry, divided into: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) 20 <seg lang="la">cohortes</seg> of 420 men each, called <seg lang="la">cohortes alares</seg>, because in time of battle they formed the wings (<seg lang="la">alae</seg>) of the two combined legions; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) four <seg lang="la">cohortes extraordinariae</seg>, or select cohorts of 400 men each.</p>
 <p>From about the beginning of the first century B.C., the Roman legion, averaging 4000 men, was also divided into ten <seg lang="la">cohortes</seg>, each containing three <seg lang="la">manipuli</seg> or six <seg lang="la">centuriae.</seg> In the imperial times, the auxiliary troops assigned to the legions stationed in the provinces were also divided into cohorts (<seg lang="la">cohortes auxiliariae</seg>). These cohorts contained either 500 men (=5 <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>), or 1000 men (=10 <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>). They consisted either entirely of infantry, or partly of cavalry (380 infantry+120 cavalry; 760 infantry+240 cavalry). For the commanders of these cohorts, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspraefectus-legionis">Praefectus</ref>. The troops stationed in Rome were also numbered according to <hi rend="italic">cohorts.</hi> (1) The <seg lang="la">cohortes praetoriae</seg>, originally nine, but afterwards ten in number, which formed the imperial body-guard. Each cohort consisted 
<pb n="380" /><cb /> of 1000 men, including infantry and cavalry. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspraetoriani">Praetoriani</ref>.) The institution of a bodyguard was due to Augustus, and was a development of the <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria</seg>, or body-guard of the republican generals. Its title shows that it was as old as the time when the consuls bore the name of <seg lang="la">praetores.</seg> This <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria</seg> was originally formed exclusively of cavalry, mainly of equestrian rank. But towards the end of the republican age, when every independent commander had his own <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria</seg>, it was made up partly of infantry, who were mainly veterans, partly of picked cavalry of the allies, and partly of Roman <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, who usually served their <seg lang="la">tirocinium</seg>, or first year, in this way.</p>
 <p>(2) Three, and in later times four, <seg lang="la">cohortes urbanae</seg>, consisting each of 1000 men, were placed under the command of the <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi.</seg> They had separate barracks, but ranked below the body-guard and above the legionaries.</p>
 <p>(3) Seven <seg lang="la">cohortes vigilum</seg>, of 1000 men each, were under the command of the <seg lang="la">praefectus vigilum.</seg> These formed the night police and fire brigade, and were distributed throughout the city, one to every two of the fourteen <seg lang="la">regiones.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossvigiles">Vigiles</ref>.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. In Greece, colonies were sometimes founded by vanquished peoples, who left their homes to escape subjection at the hand of a foreign enemy; sometimes as a sequel to civil disorders; sometimes to get rid of surplus population, and thereby to avoid internal convulsions. But in most cases the object was to establish and facilitate relations of trade with foreign countries. If a Greek city was sending out a colony, an oracle (before all others that of Delphi) was almost invariably consulted. Sometimes certain classes of citizens were called upon to take part in the enterprises; sometimes one son was chosen by lot from every house where there were several sons; and strangers expressing a desire to join were admitted. A person of distinction was selected to guide the emigrants and make the necessary arrangements. It was usual to honour these founders of colonies, after their death, as heroes. Some of the sacred fire was taken from the public hearth in the Prytaneum, and the fire on the public hearth of the new city was kindled thereat. And, just as each individual had his private shrines, so the new community maintained the worship of its chief domestic deities, the colony sending embassies and votive gifts to their principal festivals.</p>
 <p>The relation between colony and mother-city was viewed as one of mutual affection. Any differences that arose were made up, if possible, by peaceful means, war being deemed excusable only in cases of extreme necessity. The charter of foundation contained general provisions for the arrangement of the affairs of the colony, and also some special enactments. The constitution of the mother-city was usually adopted by the colony, but the new city remained politically independent. If the colony sent out a fresh colony on its own account, the mother-city was generally consulted, or was at least requested to furnish a leader. The <foreign lang="greek">κληροῦχοι</foreign> formed a special class of Greek colonists. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscleruchia">Cleruchia</ref>.) The trade factories set up in foreign countries (in Egypt, for instance) were somewhat different from the ordinary colonies, the members retaining the right of domicile in their own fatherland.<cb /></p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. It was an old custom in Italy to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests. The Romans, accordingly, having no standing army, used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison. These bodies would consist partly of Roman citizens, usually to the number of three hundred; partly of members of the Latin confederacy, in larger numbers. The third part of the conquered territory was handed over to the settlers. The <title>coloniae civium Romanorum</title> (colonies of Roman citizens) were specially intended to secure the two sea-coasts of Italy, and were hence called <seg lang="la">coloniae maritimae.</seg> The <title>coloniae Latinae</title>, of which there was a far greater number, served the same purpose for the mainland.</p>
 <p>The duty of leading the colonists and founding the settlement was intrusted to a commission usually consisting of three members, and elected by the people. These men continued to stand in the relation of patrons (<seg lang="la">patroni</seg>) to the colony after its foundation. The colonists entered the conquered city in military array, preceded by banners, and the foundation was celebrated with special solemnities. The <seg lang="la">coloniae</seg> were free from taxes, and had their own constitution, a copy of the Roman, electing from their own body their Senate and other officers of State. To this constitution the original inhabitants had to submit. The <title>coloniae civium Romanorum</title> retained the Roman citizenship, and were free from military service, their position as outposts being regarded as an equivalent. The members of the <title>coloniae Latinae</title> served among the <seg lang="la">socii</seg>, and possessed the so-called <title>ius Latinum.</title> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslatinitas">Latinitas</ref>.) This secured to them the right of acquiring property (<seg lang="la">commercium</seg>) and settlement in Rome, and under certain conditions the power of becoming Roman citizens; though in course of time these rights underwent many limitations.</p>
 <p>From the time of the Gracchi the colonies lost their military character. Colonization came to be regarded as a means of providing for the poorest class of the Roman populace. After the time of Sulla it was adopted as a way of granting land to veteran soldiers. The right of founding colonies was taken away from the people by Caesar, and passed into the hands of the emperors, who used it (mainly in the provinces) for the exclusive purpose of establishing military settlements, partly with the old idea of securing conquered territory. It was only in exceptional cases that the provincial colonies enjoyed the immunity from taxation which was granted to those in Italy.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κολοφών</foreign>). A city of Ionia, northwest of Ephesus. It was founded by Andraemon, son of Codrus, and was situated about two miles from the coast, its harbour, called Notium, being connected with the city by means of long walls. Colophon was destroyed by Lysimachus, together with Lebedus, in order to swell the population of the new town he had founded at Ephesus (Pausan. i. 9). The Colophonians are stigmatized by several ancient writers as very effeminate and luxurious, and yet Strabo says that, at one period, this place possessed a flourishing navy, and that its cavalry was in such repute that victory followed wherever they were employed. Hence arose the proverb <foreign lang="greek">Κολοφῶνα ἐπιτίθεναι</foreign>, “to add a Colophonian”—i. e. to put the finishing hand to an affair. The scholiast on Plato, however, gives another explanation of the saying, which appears somewhat more probable, though its authority is not so good. He states that the Colophonians had the right of a double vote in the general assembly of the Ionians, on account of the service they had rendered the confederacy by inducing the city of Smyrna to join it. Hence they were frequently enabled to decide points left undetermined from a parity of suffrages. It arose from this old saying that, in the early periods of the art of printing, the account which the printer gave of the place and date of the edition, being the last thing printed at the end of the book, was called the <hi rend="italic">colophon.</hi> This city was one of the places which contended for the birth of Homer, and was unquestionably the native place of Mimnermus and Hermesianax.

<head orig="Colossus">Colossus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κολοσσός</foreign>). A word of rare occurrence in the Attic writers, but used by both Greeks and Romans to signify a statue larger than life ( <title>Agam.</title> 406), and thence a person of extraordinary stature and beauty is termed <hi rend="italic">colosseros</hi> by Suetonius (<title>Calig.</title> 35). In like manner the architectural ornaments in the upper stories of lofty buildings, which require to be of large dimensions in consequence of their remoteness, are termed <hi rend="italic">colossicotera</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">κολοσσικώτερα</foreign>, Vitruv. iii. 3).</p>
 <p>Among the colossal statues of Greece the most celebrated, according to Pliny , was the bronze colossus at Rhodes by <ref type="cross" target="crosschares">Chares</ref> (q.v.) of Lindus, a pupil of Lysippus, who gave twelve years (B.C. 292-280) <cb /> to casting the statue. Its height is variously given as 90 and 120 feet. Fifty-six years after its erection it was thrown down by an earthquake and lay in ruins until A.D. 653, when the Arabs sold the pieces to a Jew of Edessa for old metal. In this one island there were more than 100 colossi. Pliny mentions another Greek colossus of Apollo, the work of Calamis, which cost 500 talents, and was thirty cubits high, in the city of Apollonia, whence it was transferred to the Capitol by M. Lucullus; and also those of Zeus and Heracles, at Tarentum, by Lysippus. To the list of Pliny must be added the more important colossal statues of Phidias, the most beautiful of which were his chryselephantine statues of Zeus, at Olympia (more than forty feet high, seated), and of Athené, in the Parthenon at Athens; the largest (more than seventy feet high, including the base) was his bronze statue commonly called Athené Promachos, on the Acropolis. See <ref type="cross" target="crossathene">Athené;</ref> and the illustration in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>, p. 155.</p>
 <p>Among the works of this description made expressly by or for the Romans, those most frequently alluded to are the following: (1) A statue of Iupiter upon the Capitol, made by order of Sp. Carvilius, from the armour of the Samnites, which was so large that it could be seen from the Alban Mount.</p>
 <p>(2) A bronze statue of Apollo at the Palatine Library, to which the bronze head now preserved in the Capitol probably belonged.</p>
 <p>(3) A bronze statue of Augustus in the Forum, which bore his name.</p>
 <p>(4) The colossus of Nero, which was executed by Zenodorus, and which is quoted by Pliny as a proof that the taste for bronze statues was lost, for this was adorned with gold and silver. Its height was 110 or 120 feet ( <bibl n="Suet. Nero 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 31</bibl>). It was originally placed in the vestibule of the Domus Aurea, but was afterwards removed by Vespasian to the Via Sacra, and Hadrian again moved it to a position to the north of the Colosseum, where the basement upon which it stood is still to be seen; from it the contiguous amphitheatre is supposed to have gained the name of “Colosseum.” Vespasian had converted it into a statue of the Sun. Twenty-four elephants were employed by Hadrian to remove it, when he was about to build the Temple of Venus at Rome ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 19" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>19</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(5) An equestrian statue of Domitian, of bronze gilt, which was placed in the centre of the Forum ( <bibl n="Stat.

 <p>The Romans filled the strainer with ice or snow (<seg lang="la">colum nivarium</seg>) in order to cool and dilute the wine at the same time that it was cleared.

 <p>The word is also used to denote the following objects, which derive their name from their resemblance to a dove-cote:</p>
 <p>(1) A sepulchral chamber. The word was metaphorically applied to a subterranean vault provided with rows of small niches, lying one above the other, and intended for the reception of the urns containing the ashes of the dead. These large burial-places were built by rich people whose freedmen were too numerous to be interred in the family burial-place. They were also erected by the Caesars for their slaves and freedmen. Several of these still exist—for instance, that of Livia, the consort of Augustus, who built one for her freedmen on the Appian Way. Common burialplaces, in which a niche could be bespoken before<figure id="fig.00383.2">
<head orig="Columbarium. (Villa Rufini.)">Columbarium. (Villa Rufini.)</head>
</figure> hand, were sometimes constructed by private individuals on speculation for people who were too poor to have a grave of their own. Columbaria were usually built by religious or mercantile societies, or by burial clubs for their own members. In such cases the members contributed a single capital payment and yearly subscriptions, which gave them the right to a decent burial and a niche in the vault. The names of the dead were inscribed on marble tablets over each niche. See Lanciani, <title>Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries</title>, pp. 129-133 <bibl default="NO">(Boston, 1888)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Each of the niches contained a pair of urns, with <cb /> the names of the persons whose ashes they contained inscribed over them. The use of the word, and mode of occupation, is testified in the following inscription: <hi rend="center"><hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Abucius Hermes in hoc ordine ab imo ad summum columbaria ix. ollae xviii. sibi posterisque suis</hi>.</hi>
 </p>
 <p>(2) A machine used to raise water for the purpose of irrigation. As described by Vitruvius, the vents through which the water was conveyed into the receiving trough were termed columbaria. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossantlia">Antlia</ref>.) The difference between that representation and the machine now under consideration consisted in the following points: The wheel of the latter is a solid one (<seg lang="la">tympanum</seg>) instead of radiated (<seg lang="la">rota</seg>), and was worked as a treadmill by men who stood upon platforms projecting from the flat sides instead of being turned by a stream. Between the intervals of each platform a series of grooves or channels (<seg lang="la">columbaria</seg>) were formed in the sides of the tympanum, through which the water taken up by a number of scoops placed on the outer margin of the wheel, like the jars in the cut referred to, was conducted into a wooden trough below.
 </p>
 <p>(3) The cavities into which the extreme ends of the beams upon which a roof is supported (<seg lang="la">tignorum cubilia</seg>), and which are represented by triglyphs in the Doric order, were termed columbaria by the Roman architects; that is, while they remained empty, and until filled up by the head of the beam.

 <head><surname full="yes">Columella</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">L. Iunius Moderātus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman writer, born at Gades, in the reign of Augustus or Tiberius, and a contemporary, according to his own account, of Seneca and Celsus. The elder Pliny also frequently makes mention of him. His father, Marcus Columella, had possessions in the province of Baetica. The son betook himself at an early period to Rome, where he passed his life, with the exception of a few journeys to Syria and Cilicia. Two works of his remain: one, entitled <title>De Re Rustica</title>, in twelve books; the other, <title>De Arboribus.</title> This last made, very probably, part of a work on agriculture, in four books, which Columella had published as the first edition of that which we now have in twelve books. On this supposition, Cassiodorus was correct in saying that Columella had written a work in sixteen books on rural economy. This author appears to have been but little read. Among the ancients, Pliny , Servius, Cassiodorus, and Isidorus are the only ones who cite him. He fell into almost complete neglect after Palladius had made an abridgment of his work. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalladius">Palladius</ref>.) The style of Columella is pure and elegant; if any reproach can be made against him, it is that of being too studied in his language for the subject of which he treats.</p>
 <p>The tenth book, which he originally intended to be the conclusion, is in verse (dactylic hexameters), and is a sort of supplement to the <title>Georgics</title> of Vergil, whose style Columella imitates with considerable success. It treats of gardening. The eleventh and twelfth books were subsequently added by the author, as not having exhausted his subject. The best MS. of Columella is the Codex Sangermanensis of the ninth century, now in St. Petersburg. The <title>Res Rustica</title> is contained in the collections 
<pb n="384" /><cb /> of the <title>Scriptores Rei Rusticae</title>, and has been separately edited by Ress <bibl default="NO">(Fleusburg, 1795)</bibl>, and bk. x. in Wernsdorf's <title>Poetae Latini Minores.</title> (See Barberet, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Columellae Vita et Scriptis</title> (Nancy, 1888)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κίων, στύλος</foreign>). A column, employed in architecture to support the entablature and roof of an edifice. It is composed of three principal parts: the capital (<seg lang="la">capitulum</seg>), the shaft (<seg lang="la">scapus</seg>), and the base (<seg lang="la">spira</seg>). The column was, moreover, constructed in three principal styles or orders, each possessing characteristic forms and proportions of its own, distinctive of the order, but by unprofessional persons most readily distinguished by the difference in the capitals. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dorĭca</hi>, the Doric; the oldest, most substantial, and heaviest of all, which has no base, and a very simple capital. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitulum">Capitulum</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps"> Ionĭca,</hi> the Ionic; the next in lightness, which is furnished with a base and has its capital decorated with volutes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitulum">Capitulum</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps"> Corinthia,</hi> the Corinthian; the lightest of all, which has a base and a plinth below it, and a deep capital ornamented with foliage. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitulum">Capitulum</ref>.) To these are often added:</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tuscanĭca</hi>, the Tuscan; only known from the account of Vitruvius, and which nearly resembled the Roman Doric; and</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Composĭta</hi>, the Composite; a mixed order, formed by combining the volutes of the Ionic with the foliage of the Corinthian.</p>
 <p>Figs. 1 and 2 give instances of the Doric style from the temple at Paestum and the Parthenon at Athens. The Doric column consists (A) of the shaft, which increases in diameter almost invisibly up to about one-quarter of its height, and diminishes slightly after that point. It has no base, but rests immediately on the stylobate. It is surrounded with semicircular flutings, meeting each other at a sharp angle. These were chiselled with a cedarwood tool after the separate drums had been put together. (B) The capital. This consists of three parts— (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the <hi rend="italic">hypotrachelion</hi>, or neck of the column, a continuation of the shaft, but separated by <figure id="fig.00384">
<head orig="Doric Order.">Doric Order.</head>
</figure> <cb /> an indentation from the other drums. It is wider at the top than at the bottom, and is generally ornamented with several parallel and horizontal rings. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <seg lang="la">echinus</seg>, a circular moulding or cushion, which widens greatly towards the top. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <seg lang="la">abax</seg> or <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi>, a square slab supporting the architrave or epistylion. The height of the shaft is usually 5 1/2 times, the distance between the columns 1 1/2 times, the diameter of the base of the column. The architrave is a quadrangular beam of stone, reaching from pillar to pillar. On this again rests the frieze (<hi rend="italic">zophoros</hi>), so called from the metopes which are adorned with sculptures in relief. These metopes are square spaces between the triglyphs; the triglyphs are surfaces cut into three concave grooves, two whole grooves in the centre, and two half grooves at the sides. One is placed over each pillar, and one between each pair of pillars. The entablature is completed by a projecting cornice, a slab crowned with a simple heading-course, the lower surface of which is ornamented with sloping corbels (<foreign lang="greek">στάγονες</foreign>, <seg lang="la">mutuli</seg>).</p>
 <p>An instance is given in <bibl n="Alex. Fig. 3" default="NO"> Fig.3</bibl> from the temple on the Ilissus at Athens. These are loftier than the <figure id="fig.00384.2">
<head orig="Ionic Order.">Ionic Order.</head>

<head orig="Corinthian Order.">Ionic Order.</head>
</figure> Doric, their height being 8 1/2-9 1/2 times the diameter of the lower part. The enlargement of the lower part is also less than in the Doric columns, the distance between each column greater (2 diameters), the flutings (generally 24 in number) deeper, and separated by small flat surfaces. The Ionic column has a base, consisting of a square slab 
<pb n="385" /><cb /> (<foreign lang="greek">πλίνθος</foreign>), and several cushion-like supports separated by grooves. The capital, again, is more artistically developed. The neck, instead of flutings, has five leaves worked in relief. The echinus is very small and ornamented with an egg pattern. Over it, instead of the <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi>, is a four-cornered cushion ending before and behind in spiral volutes, supporting a narrow square slab, which is also adorned with an egg pattern. The architrave is divided into three bands, projecting one above the other, and upon it rises, in an uninterrupted surface, the frieze, adorned with reliefs continuously along its whole length. Finally, the cornice is composed of different parts.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Corinthian</hi> column is shown in Fig. 4, from the monument of Lysicrates at Athens. The base and shaft are identical with the Ionic, but the capital takes the form of an open calix formed of acanthus leaves. Above this is another set of leaves, from between which grow stalks with small leaves, rounded into the form of volutes. On this rests a small abacus widening towards the top, and on this, again, the entablature, which is borrowed from the Ionic order. On the human figures employed instead of columns to support the entablature, see <ref type="cross" target="crossatlas">Atlas</ref>; Canephori; <ref type="cross" target="crosscaryae">Caryae</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Romans adopted the Greek styles of column, but not always in their pure form. They were fondest of the Corinthian, which they laboured to enrich with new and often excessive ornamentation. For instance, they crowned the Corinthian capital with the Ionic, thus forming what is called the Roman or composite capital. The style known as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tuscan</hi> is a degenerate form of the Doric. The Tuscan column has a smooth shaft, in height 7 diameters of the lower part, and tapering up to three-quarters of its lower dimensions. Its base consists of two parts—a circular plinth and a cushion of equal height. The capital is formed of three parts of equal height.</p>
 <p>In other styles, too, the Romans sometimes adopted the smooth instead of the fluted shaft, as, for instance, in the <ref type="cross" target="crosspantheon">Pantheon</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>This most beautiful of all architectural supports originated from the simplest beginnings. A few strong poles, or the straight trunks of trees, stuck into the ground, in order to support a cross-piece for a thatch of boughs or straw to rest upon, formed the first shaft (<seg lang="la">scapus</seg>) of a column. When a tile or slab of wood was placed under the bottom of the trunk to form a foundation and prevent the shaft from sinking too deeply into the ground, the first notion of a base (<seg lang="la">spira</seg>) was attained; and a similar one, placed on its top, to afford a broader surface for the cross-beam or architrave to rest upon, furnished the first capital. Thus these simple elements, elaborated by the genius and industry of succeeding ages, produced the several distinctive properties of the architectural orders.</p>
 <p>One point, however, is to be constantly borne in mind—that the column of ancient architecture always implies a real, and not a fictitious, support; for neither the Greeks nor the Romans, until the arts had declined, ever made use of columns as the moderns do, in their buildings, as a superfluous ornament, or mere accessory to the edifice, but as a main and essentially constituent portion of the fabric, which would immediately fall to pieces if they were removed; and that the abusive application of coupled, clustered, incastrated, imbedded columns, etc., was never admitted in Greek architecture; <cb /> for the chief beauty of the column consists in its isolation, by means of which it presents an endless variety of views and changes of scene, with every movement of the spectator, whether seen in rank or in file.

At any rate, the inscription on the column of Claudius, part of which was excavated in 1566 in the Forum, is not a copy of the first one, as many of the verbal forms contained in it are too antique, while others are too modern, for the age in which it professes to have been written. Thus, the form <hi rend="SmallCaps">c</hi> is used for <hi rend="SmallCaps">g; -et</hi> for <hi rend="SmallCaps">it;</hi> ablatives in -<hi rend="SmallCaps">d</hi>, elsewhere unknown (<hi rend="italic">dictatored, navaled</hi>) —all of which are too archaic; while, on the other hand, <hi rend="SmallCaps">s</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">m</hi> at the end of words are never omitted in it, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">in</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">en</hi> is used for <hi rend="SmallCaps">endo</hi>.

 <p> Single columns were erected from the earliest times to commemorate persons or events. Early Roman examples are those in honour of C. Maenius and P. Minucius, mentioned by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 21</bibl>). Of a later date is the marble monolith to Iulius Caesar, set up in the Forum after his death ( <title>Iul.</title> 85).</p>
 <p>More important, as well on account of their imposing size as of their value to the archaeologist, are the lofty and elaborate columns erected in im<figure id="fig.00386">

</figure> perial times. The finest of these monuments is that figured in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna-cochlis">Columna Cochlis</ref>, and which was voted by the Senate in honour of Trajan, and executed by Apollodorus in A.D. 104. The column itself is apparently of the Tuscan order, and is composed of huge drums of white marble, pierced within so as to form a spiral staircase, to which there is an entrance in the pedestal. A bas-relief of the chief episodes in the Dacian campaigns winds round the shaft. Including the bronze statue of the emperor, the total height was not less than 130 feet. It still stands in the Foro Traiano at Rome.</p>
 <p>The same mode of construction is found in the Antonine Column, erected in honour of Marcus Aurelius and illustrating his victories over the Marcomanni, still to be seen in the Piazza della Colonna. Much less admirable, artistically, was the column erected by Constantine in the Forum of Constantinople. It was erected on a pillar of white marble, 20 feet in height, and was composed of ten pieces of porphyry. On its summit, 120 feet from the earth, was a colossal bronze statue of Apollo, supposed to be the work of Phidias. A fragment of this structure survives at Constantinople under the name of “the Burnt Pillar.” Of the time of the same emperor was the curious Serpentine Column of brass, formed of the twisted <cb /> <figure id="fig.00386.2">

 <p> “The Pillars of Hercules”; a name often given to Calpé and Abyla, or the heights on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar. The tradition was that the Mediterranean had no outlet in this quarter until Hercules broke through the mountain barrier, and thus formed the present straits. The rocky height on either side of the opening was fabled to have been placed there by him as a memorial of his achievement, and as marking the limits of his wanderings towards the west.

<div2 id="crosscoma" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Coma">Coma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κόμη</foreign>). The hair of the head. Besides this general term, there are various other words, both in Greek and Latin, signifying the hair, each of which acquires its distinctive meaning from some physical property of the hair itself or from some peculiarity in the mode of arranging it, the principal of which are as follows: (1) <foreign lang="greek">Ἔθειρα</foreign>, a head of hair when carefully dressed.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Χαίτη</foreign>, properly the mane of a horse or lion, is used to signify long, flowing hair.</p>
 <p>(3) <foreign lang="greek">Φόβη</foreign>, when accurately used, implies the hair of the head in a state of disorder incident to a person under a sense of fear.</p>
 <p>(4) <foreign lang="greek">Ποκάς</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">πείκω</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πέκω</foreign>, the hair when combed and dressed.</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">Θρίξ</foreign>, a general term for hair, from the plural of which the Romans perhaps borrowed their word <seg lang="la">tricae</seg>—<foreign lang="greek">τρίχωσις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">τρίχωμα</foreign> are used in the same sense.</p>
 <p>(6) <foreign lang="greek">Κόρση</foreign> ( <foreign lang="greek"> αττ.κόρρη</foreign>), from the old word <foreign lang="greek">κόρ</foreign>, “the head,” signifies properly the hair on the top of the head; and hence a particular fashion of arranging the <figure id="fig.00387.2">
<head orig="Apollo Belvedere.">Apollo Belvedere.</head>
</figure> <figure id="fig.00387.3">
<head orig="Artemis. (British Museum.)">Apollo Belvedere.</head>
</figure> <cb /> hair among the Greek women was termed <foreign lang="greek">κόρυμβος</foreign>; or, when worn in the same style by the men, it was designated by another derivative from the same word, <foreign lang="greek">κρώβυλος</foreign>. To produce this effect the hair was drawn up all round the head from the front and back, and fastened in a bow on the top, as exemplified in the two preceding busts—one of the Apollo Belvedere, the other of Artemis—from the British Museum.</p>
 <p>Instead of a band, the people of Athens fastened the bow with an ornamental clasp, fashioned like <figure id="fig.00387.4">
<head orig="Heracles. (British Museum.)">Heracles. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> a grasshopper, to show that they were aborigines. <foreign lang="greek">Κρώβυλος</foreign> is also used for a cap of network. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscalantica">Calantica</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(7) <foreign lang="greek">Μαλλός</foreign>, which properly means wool, was also used for the short, round, curly hair, which resembles the fleece of a lamb, such as is seen in some of the early Greek sculptures, particularly in the heads of Heracles, one of which is subjoined from a specimen in the British Museum.
 </p>
 <p>(8) <foreign lang="greek">Κέρας</foreign> was a Greek term used when the hair was combed up from the temples on each side, so as to give it the appearance of two horns, as is seen in the heads of fauns and satyrs, and in the bust of Zeus on the following page.</p>
 <p>(9) <foreign lang="greek">Κίκιννος, πλοχμός, χλιδαί</foreign>, the hair which falls in ringlets, either natural or artificial, which was sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">βόστρυχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πλόκαμος</foreign>. All these terms, when strictly appropriated, seem to designate that singular style of coiffure which is observable in Etruscan and early Greek works, and common to both sexes, as is seen in the casts from the temple of Athené at Aegina in the British Museum.</p>
 <p>Besides the generic <seg lang="la">coma</seg>, the Romans made use of the following terms, expressive of some peculiar qualities in the hair, or particular mode of arrangement: (1) <title>Capillus</title>, according to the old etymologists, <seg lang="la">quasi capitis pilus.</seg></p>
 <p>(2) <title>Crinis</title>, the hair when carefully dressed.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Caesaries</title>, which is said, though without much probability, to be connected with <seg lang="la">caedo</seg>, the hair of the male sex, because they wore it short, whereas the women did not.</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Cincinnus</title>, <foreign lang="greek">κίκιννος</foreign>, the hair when platted and <figure id="fig.00387.5">
<head orig="Cupid. (British Museum.)">Cupid. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> dressed in circles, like the head on page 17 (s.v. <ref type="cross" target="crossacus">Acus</ref>), as it is still worn by the women of Mola di Gaieta (Formiae). Martial terms these circles <seg lang="la">anuli</seg>, and Claudian <seg lang="la">orbes.</seg></p>
 <p>(5) <title>Cirrus</title>, a lock of curly hair. The locks which fell over the forehead were termed <seg lang="la">capronae</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">προκόμιον</foreign>), the modern “bang” or “fringe”; those which fell from the temples over the ears, <seg lang="la">antiae.</seg> Both the <seg lang="la">antiae</seg> and <seg lang="la">capronae</seg> are accurately traced in the figure of Cupid bending his bow, in the British Museum, from which the accompanying illustration is taken.</p>
 <p>All the Greek divinities are distinguished by a characteristic coiffure, modified in some respects as the arts progressed, but never altered in character from the original model; so that any person 
<pb n="388" /><cb />
 tolerably conversant with the works of Greek art may almost invariably recognize the deity represented from the disposition of the hair. We proceed to specify some of the principal ones. <figure id="fig.00388">

 <p>The head of the lion is the type upon which that of Zeus is formed, particularly in the disposition of the hair, which rises from the forehead and falls <figure id="fig.00388.3">
<head orig="Serapis. (British Museum.)">Serapis. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> back in loose curls down the sides of the face, until it forms a junction with the beard. This is made clear by the two preceding illustrations, one of which is from a statue of Zeus in the Vatican, supposed to be a copy of the Phidian Zeus; and the other is a lion's head from the British Museum. The same disposition of the hair is likewise preserved in all the real or pretended descendants from Zeus, such as Aesculapius, Alexander, etc.</p>
 <p>Pluto or Serapis has the hair longer, straighter, and lower over the forehead, in order to give severity to the aspect, and with the modius on his head, as represented in the above drawing from the British Museum. The modius is decorated with an olive <figure id="fig.00388.4">
<head orig="Poseidon. (British Museum.)">Poseidon. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> branch, for oil was used instead of wine in sacrifices to Pluto.</p>
 <p>The hair of Poseidon is cut finer and sharper than that of Zeus. It rises from the forehead, and then falls down in flakes, as if wet, in the manner represented in the accompanying head from the British Museum.</p>
 <p>Apollo is usually repre<figure id="fig.00388.5">
<head orig="Apollo. (British Museum.)">Apollo. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> sented with the <foreign lang="greek">κρώβυλος</foreign>; but when the hair is not tied up on the top of the head it is always long and flowing over the neck and shoulders, as represented in the annexed illustration from a very beautiful and early Greek sculpture in the British Museum. Hence he is called <seg lang="la">intonsus</seg> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀκερσεκόμης</foreign>.</p>
 <p>Dionysus also wears his hair <cb /> unshorn; for he, as well as Apollo, is typical of perpetual youth.</p>
 <p>In the mature age of Greek art, Hermes has short curly hair, as represented by the head on the left hand in the illustration below, from a statue in the Vatican, which was for a long time falsely ascribed to Antinoüs; but in very early Greek works he is represented with braided hair, in the Etruscan style, and a sharp-pointed beard (see the right-hand illustration, from an altar in the Museum of the Capitol at Rome), whence he is termed <foreign lang="greek">σφηνοπώγων</foreign>. <figure id="fig.00388.6">

 <p>The hair of Heré or Iuno is parted in the front, and on the top of the head is a kind of diadem, called in Latin <seg lang="la">corona</seg>, and in Greek <foreign lang="greek">σφενδόνη</foreign>, from its resemblance to a sling, the broad part of which <figure id="fig.00388.10"><head>Heré with <foreign lang="greek">σφενδόνη</foreign>. (British Museum.)</head></figure> is placed above the forehead, while the two lashes act as bands to confine the hair on the sides of the head and fasten it behind, in the manner represented in the annexed illustration from the British Museum.</p>
 <p>Pallas is rarely seen without her helmet; but when portrayed with her head uncovered the hair is tied up in a knot at some distance from the head, and then falls from the band in long parallel curls. 
<pb n="389" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Aphrodité and Artemis are sometimes adorned with the <foreign lang="greek">κόρυμβος</foreign>; but both these divinities are more frequently represented with their hair dressed in the simple style of the young Greek girls, whose hair is parted in front, and conducted round to the back, so as to conceal the upper part of the ears. It is then tied in a plain knot at the nape of the neck, or, at other times, though less frequently, at the top of the head; both of which fashions are represented in the two illustrations subjoined; one, that on the right, Niobé, and the other from a bas-relief at Rome. <figure id="fig.00389">

 <p>False hair, or wigs, <foreign lang="greek">φενάκη, πηϝίκη, κόμαι προσθέται, τριχὲς προσθέται</foreign>, <seg lang="la">galerus, corymbium, caliendrum, capillamentum</seg>, were also worn by the people of both countries ( <bibl n="Mart.  5. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.v. 68</bibl>; xii. 23), and much esteemed by them.</p>
 <p>Several passages of Latin literature show the fondness of the Roman women for blond hair, quantities of which were imported from Germany to be made up into wigs. (See Juv. vi. 120; <bibl n="Ov. Ars 3.163" default="NO" valid="yes">Ovid. <title>A. A.</title> iii. 163.</bibl>) Hence, in some of the statues, the hair was gilt, remains of which are discernible in the Venus dei Medici and in the Apollo of the Capitol; and both sexes dyed their hair when it grew gray ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 26.  164" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxvi. 164</bibl>). <figure id="fig.00389.3">

 <p>In very early times the Romans wore their hair long, as was represented in the oldest statues during the age of Varro, and hence the Romans of the Augustan Age designated their ancestors <seg lang="la">intonsi</seg> and <seg lang="la">capillati.</seg> But this fashion did not last after the year B.C. 300, as appears by the remaining works of art. The women, too, dressed their hair with simplicity, at least until the time of the emperors, and probably much in the same style as those of Greece; but at the Augustan period a variety of different head-dresses came into fashion, <cb /> many of which are described by Ovid. Four specimens of different periods are given below. The first head on the left represents Octavia, the niece of Augustus, from the Museum in the Capitol at Rome; the next, Messalina, fifth wife of the emperor Claudius; the one below, on the left, Sabina, the wife of Hadrian; and the next, Plautilla, the wife of Caracalla, which last three are from the British Museum. <figure id="fig.00389.4">

 <p>Both countries had some peculiar customs connected with the growth of their hair and illustrative of their moral or physical conditions. The Spartans combed and dressed their heads with especial care when about to encounter any great danger, in which act Leonidas and his followers were discovered by the spies of Xerxes before the battle of Thermopylae. The sailors of both nations shaved off their hair after an escape from shipwreck or other heavy calamity and dedicated it to the gods. In the earlier ages, the Greeks of both sexes cut their hair close in mourning; but subsequently this practice was more exclusively confined to the women, the men leaving theirs long and neglected, as was the custom among the Romans.</p>
 <p>In childhood—that is, up to the age of puberty— the hair of the males was suffered to grow long among both nations, when it was clipped and dedicated to some river or deity, from thence called <foreign lang="greek">κουροτρόφος</foreign> by the poets, and therefore to cut off the hair means to take the <seg lang="la">toga virilis.</seg> At Athens this ceremony was performed on the third day of the festival Apaturia, which is therefore termed <foreign lang="greek">κουρεῶτις</foreign>.</p>
 <p>In both countries the slaves were shaved as a mark of servitude. On barbers, see <ref type="cross" target="crosstonsor">Tonsor</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Vestal Virgins also cut their hair short upon taking their vows; which rite still remains in the Roman Church, in which all women have their hair 
<pb n="390" /><cb />
 cut close upon taking the veil. The hair was fastened up with hair-pins (<seg lang="la">acus crinales</seg>) and combs (<seg lang="la">pectines</seg>), which we find made of boxwood, ivory, and tortoise-shell. The hair was also at times fastened with bands (<seg lang="la">diademata</seg>) of gold set with jewels, like the Greek <foreign lang="greek">στεφάνη</foreign>. As to nets, the women used to wear <seg lang="la">reticula</seg>, sometimes made of gold threads. The <seg lang="la">mitra</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 66</bibl>) has been explained elsewhere, and the <seg lang="la">calautica</seg>, or <seg lang="la">calantica</seg>, or <hi rend="italic">calvatica</hi> was a cap with lappets covering the ears and with two strings for tying under the chin.

It was situated to the northeast of Zela, and not far from the source of the Iris. This place was celebrated for the worship of the goddess Mâ, supposed to answer to the Bellona of the West. She was likewise revered with equal honours in the Cappadocian Comana. The priesthood attached to the temple was an office of the highest emolument and dignity, and was sought after by kings and princes. The city itself was large and populous. The festivals of the goddess, which were held twice a year, drew thither an immense concourse. There were no less than 6000 slaves attached to the service of the temple, and most of these were courtesans. Hence it was remarked that the citizens were generally addicted to pleasure, and the town itself was styled by some “Little Corinth.”</p>

From this it was a natural transition to apply the term to the courtiers generally, even when not on a journey; and in later Latin we find it used of the holders of the various State-offices. About the time of Constantine it became a regular honorary title, whence the modern <hi rend="italic">count</hi> (French <foreign lang="fr">comte</foreign>), including various grades, answering to the <seg lang="la">comites ordinis primi, secundi, tertii.</seg></p>

This was the assembly of the patricians in their thirty <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>, who, until the change of the constitution under Servius Tullius, constituted the whole <title>populus Romanus.</title> During the regal period they were summoned by the <seg lang="la">rex</seg> or <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi>, who brought before them questions to be decided Aye or No. The voting was taken first in each curia by heads, and then according to curiae, in an order determined by lot. The business within the competence of this assembly was: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) to elect a king proposed by the <hi rend="italic">interrex; (b)</hi> to confer upon the king the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg>, by virtue of the <seg lang="la">lex curiata de imperio; (c)</seg> to decide on declarations of war, appeals, <seg lang="la">arrogationes</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossadoptio">Adoptio</ref>), and the reception of foreign families into the body of the patricians. The Servian constitution transferred the right of declaring aggressive war and the right of deciding appeals to the Comitia Centuriata, which, from this time on ward, represented the people, now composed of both patricians and plebeians. After the establishment of the Republic, the Comitia Curiata retained the right (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) of conferring, on the proposal of the Senate, the imperium on the magistrates elected by the Comitia Centuriata, and on the dictator elected by the consuls; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) of confirming, likewise on the proposal of the Senate, the alterations in the constitution decided upon by the Comitia Centuriata, and Tributa.</p>
 <p>The extinction of the political difference between patricians and plebeians destroyed the political position of the Comitia Curiata, and the mere shadow of their rights survived. The assembly itself became an unreality, so much so that, in the end, the presence of the thirty <seg lang="la">lictores curiati</seg> and three augurs was sufficient to enable legal resolutions to be passed. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslictor">Lictors</ref>.) But the Comitia Curiata retained the powers affecting the reception of a non-patrician into the patrician order, and the powers affecting the proceeding of <seg lang="la">arrogatio</seg>, especially in cases where the transition of a patrician into a plebeian family was concerned. Evidence of the exercise of these functions on their part may be traced down to the imperial period.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Comitia Calāta</hi> were also an assembly of the patrician curiae. They were so called because publicly summoned (<seg lang="la">calare</seg>). The pontifices presided, and the functions of the assembly were: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) to inaugurate the flamines, the rex sacrorum, and indeed the king himself during the regal period. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <seg lang="la">detestatio sacrorum</seg>, previous to an act of <seg lang="la">arrogatio.</seg> This was the formal release of a person passing by adoption into another family from the <seg lang="la">sacra</seg> of his former family. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossadoptio">Adoptio</ref>.) (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The ratification of wills twice a year; 
<pb n="391" /><cb />
 but this applies only to an early period. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The announcement of the calendar of festivals on the first day of every month.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Comitia Centuriāta</hi>. The assembly of the whole people, patrician as well as plebeian, arranged according to the <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg> established by Servius Tullius. The original founder of the Comitia Centuriata transferred to them certain political rights which had previously been exercised by the Comitia Curiata. It was not, however, until the foundation of the Republic, when the sovereign power in the State was transferred to the body of citizens, that they attained their real political importance. They then became the assembly in which the people, collectively, expressed its will. The right of summoning the Comitia Centuriata originally belonged to the king. During the republican period it belonged, in its full extent, to the consuls and the dictator alone. The other magistrates possessed it only within certain limits. The <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi>, for instance, could, in case of there being no consuls, summon the Comitia Centuriata to hold an election, but he could summon them for this purpose only. The censors could call them together only for the holding of the <seg lang="la">census</seg> and the <seg lang="la">lustrum;</seg> the praetors, it may be conjectured, only in the case of capital trials. In all other instances the consent of the consuls, or their authorization, was indispensable.</p>
 <p>The duties of the Comitia Centuriata during the republican period were as follows: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) To elect the higher magistrates: consuls, censors, and praetors. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) To give judgment in all the capital trials in which appeal to the people was permitted from the sentence of the magistrate sitting in judgment. This popular jurisdiction was gradually limited to political trials, common offences being dealt with by the ordinary commissions. And in the later republican age the judicial assemblies of the Comitia Centuriata became, in general, rarer, especially after the formation of special standing commissions (<seg lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</seg>) for the trial of a number of offences regarded as political. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) To decide on declaring a war of aggression; this on the proposal of the consuls, with the approval of the Senate. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) To pass laws proposed by the higher magistrates, with the approval of the Senate. This right lost much of its value after B.C. 287, when the legislative powers of the Comitia Tributa were made equal to those of the Comitia Centuriata. After this time the legislative activity of the latter assembly gradually diminished.</p>
 <p>The Comitia Centuriata were originally a military assembly, and the citizens accordingly, in ancient times, attended them in arms. On the night before the meeting, the magistrate summoning the assembly took the auspices on the place of meeting, the Campus Martius. If the auspices were favourable, signals were given, before daybreak, from the walls and the citadel by the blowing of horns, summoning the citizens to a <seg lang="la">contio.</seg> The presiding magistrate offered a sacrifice and repeated a solemn prayer, and the assembly proceeded to consider the business which required its decision. Private individuals were not allowed to speak, except with the consent of the presiding magistrate. At his command the armed people divided themselves into their <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>, and marched in this order to the Campus Martius, preceded by banners and headed by the cavalry. Arrived at the Campus, they proceeded to the voting, the president <cb /> having again put the proposal to the people in the form of a question, <hi rend="italic">Velitis iubeatis Quirites?</hi> (“Do you wish?” “Do you command?”). While the voting was going on, a red flag stood on the Ianiculum. The <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, who in ancient times used to begin the battles in war, opened the voting, and their 18 centuries were therefore called <seg lang="la">praerogativae.</seg> The result of their vote was immediately published, and, being taken as an omen for the voters who were to follow, was usually decisive. Then came the 175 centuries of the five <seg lang="la">classes</seg> of infantry in their order. Each century counted as casting one vote; this vote was decided by a previous voting within the century, which was at first open, but in later times was taken by ballot. If the 18 centuries of equites and the 80 centuries of the first class, with whom went the 2 centuries of mechanics (<seg lang="la">centuriae fabrum</seg>), were unanimous, the question was decided, as there would be a majority of 100 centuries to 93. If not, the voting went on until one side secured the votes of at least 97 centuries. The lower <seg lang="la">classes</seg> only voted in the rare cases where the votes of the higher <seg lang="la">classes</seg> were not united. The proceedings concluded with a formal announcement of the result on the part of the presiding magistrate, and the dismissal of the host. If no result was arrived at by sunset, or if unfavourable omens appeared during the proceedings, or while the voting was going on, the assembly was adjourned until the next convenient occasion.</p>
 <p>This form of voting gave the wealthier citizens a decided advantage over the poorer, and lent an aristocratic character to the Comitia Centuriata. In the third century B.C. a change was introduced in the interest of the lower <seg lang="la">classes.</seg> Each of the thirty-five <seg lang="la">tribus</seg>, or districts, into which the Roman territory was divided, included two <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg> of <hi rend="italic">iuniores</hi> and <seg lang="la">seniores</seg> respectively. (For the five <seg lang="la">classes</seg>, see <ref type="cross" target="crossexercitus">Exercitus</ref>.) Thus each of the five <seg lang="la">classes</seg> included 70 centuries, making 350 centuries in all. To this number add the 18 centuries equitum, and the 5 centuries not included in the propertied classes—namely, 2 of <seg lang="la">fabri</seg> (mechanics), 2 of <hi rend="italic">tubicines</hi> (musicians), and 1 of <seg lang="la">proletarii</seg> and <seg lang="la">liberti</seg> (the very poor and the freedmen), and the whole number of centuries amounts to 373. The centuries, it must be remembered, had by this time quite lost their military character. Under this arrangement the 88 votes of the <seg lang="la">equites</seg> and the first <seg lang="la">classis</seg> were confronted with the 285 votes of the rest. Besides this, the right of voting first was taken from the equites and given to the <seg lang="la">centuria praerogativa</seg> chosen by lot from the first <seg lang="la">classis.</seg> The voting, it is true, was still taken in the order of the <seg lang="la">classes</seg>, but the <seg lang="la">classes</seg> were seldom unanimous as in former times; for the interests of the tribus, which were represented in each <seg lang="la">classis</seg> by two centuries respectively, were generally divergent, and the centuries voted in the sense of their tribe. The consequence was that it was often necessary—indeed, perhaps that it became the rule, at least at elections—to take the votes of all the <seg lang="la">classes.</seg></p>
 <p>In early times the military arrangement was sufficient to secure the maintenance of order. But after its disappearance the <seg lang="la">classes</seg> were separated and the centuriae kept apart by wooden barriers (<seg lang="la">saepta</seg>), from which the centuries passed over bridges into an open inner space called <seg lang="la">ovile</seg> (sheepfold). On the position of the Comitia Centuriata during the imperial age, see below. 
<pb n="392" /><cb />
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Comitia Tribūta</hi>. This was the collective assembly of the people arranged according to the local distribution of tribes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstribus">Tribus</ref>.) When the tribuneship of the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> was established (B.C. 494) the tribunes were allowed the right of summoning assemblies of the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> in its tribes to consider questions affecting its interests. Out of these councils of the <seg lang="la">plebs (concilia plebis)</seg> were afterwards (B.C. 449) formed the Comitia Tributa, in which the patricians were represented as well as the plebeians; but the plebeians had the preponderance, as they were the more numerous, and as the voting qualification was exactly equal. By a law passed in B.C. 449, and finally ratified in 286, the <seg lang="la">plebi scita</seg>, or resolutions of the Comitia Tributa, were declared binding upon the whole <seg lang="la">populus.</seg> The consequence was that this assembly, side by side with the Comitia Centuriata, became the representative of the popular supremacy, and, indeed, its proper and constitutional organ. This was specially the case in regard to legislation, the more so as it was far simpler to summon the people by tribes than by centuries.</p>
 <p>The right of summoning the Comitia Tributa lay chiefly, though not exclusively, with the <seg lang="la">tribuni.</seg> Their consent was regarded as an indispensable condition, if another magistrate wished to summon or preside over the Comitia Tributa. Until the latter years of the Republic, the assembly usually met upon the Capitol, and afterwards on the Campus Martius. The functions of the Comitia Tributa, gradually acquired, were as follows: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The election of all the lower magistrates, ordinary (as the <seg lang="la">tribuni plebis, tribuni militum, aediles plebis, aediles curules</seg>) and extraordinary, under the presidency partly of the tribunes, partly of the consuls or praetors. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The nomination of the <seg lang="la">pontifex maximus</seg>, and of the coöpted members of the religious <seg lang="la">collegia</seg> of the <seg lang="la">pontifices, augures</seg>, and <seg lang="la">decemviri sacrorum.</seg> This nomination was carried out by a committee of seventeen tribes chosen by lot. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) To give judicial decisions in all suits instituted by the tribunes and aediles of the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg>, for offences against the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> or its representatives. In later times these suits were mostly instituted on the ground of bad or illegal administration. The tribunes and aediles had, in these cases, the power of inflicting pecuniary fines ranging up to a large amount. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) To pass resolutions on proposals made by the tribunes of the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> and the higher magistrates on foreign and domestic affairs —on the conclusion of peace, for instance, or the making of treaties. Their power was almost unlimited, and the more important because, strictly speaking, it was only the higher magistrates who required the authorization of the Senate. Nor had the Senate more than the right of quashing a measure passed without due formalities.</p>
 <p>The Comitia Tributa were summoned, at least seventeen days before the meeting, by the simple proclamation of a herald (<seg lang="la">praeco</seg>). As in the case of the Comitia Centuriata, business could neither be begun nor continued in the face of adverse anspices. Like the Comitia Centuriata, too, the tribal assembly met at daybreak and could not sit beyond sunset. If summoned by the tribunes, the Comitia Tributa could only meet in the city, or within the radius of a mile from it. The usual place of assembly was the Forum or the <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitium">Comitium</ref> (q.v.). If summoned by other authorities, the assembly met outside the city, most commonly in the Campus <cb /> Martius. The proceedings opened with a prayer, unaccompanied by sacrifice. The business in hand was then discussed in a <seg lang="la">contio</seg> (see above, p. 391 <seg lang="la">a</seg>); and the proposal having been read out, the meeting was requested to arrange itself according to its thirty-five tribes in the <seg lang="la">saepta</seg>, or wooden fences. Lots were drawn to decide which tribe should vote first. The tribe on which this duty fell was called <seg lang="la">principium.</seg> The result of this first vote was proclaimed, and the other tribes then proceeded to vote simultaneously, not successively. The votes given by each tribe were then announced in an order determined by lot. Finally, the general result of the voting was made known.</p>
 <p>The proposer of a measure was bound to put his proposal into due form and publish it beforehand. When a measure came to the vote, it was accepted or rejected as a whole. It became law when the presiding magistrate announced that it had been accepted. The character of the comitia had begun to decline even in the later period of the Republic. Even the citizens of Rome took but little part in them, and this is still more true of the population of Italy, who had received the Roman citizenship in B.C. 89. The Comitia Tributa, in particular, sank gradually into a mere gathering of the city mob, strengthened on all sides by the influx of corrupt elements. The results of the voting came more and more to represent, not the public interest, but the effects of direct or indirect corruption. Under the Empire the Comitia Centuriata and Tributa continued to exist—in a shadowy form, it is true—down to the third century A.D. Iulius Caesar had deprived them of the right of deciding on war and peace. Under Augustus they lost the power of jurisdiction, and, practically, the power of legislation. The imperial measures were, indeed, laid before the Comitia Tributa for ratification, but this was all; and under the successors of Augustus even this proceeding became rarer. Since the time of Vespasian, the emperors, at their accession, received their legislative and other powers from the Comitia Tributa; but this, like the rest, was a mere formality. The power of election was that which, in appearance at least, survived longest. Augustus, like Iulius Caesar, allowed the Comitia Centuriata to confirm the nomination of two candidates for the consulship. He also left to the Comitia Centuriata and Tributa the power of free election to half the other magistracies— the other half being filled by nominees of his own. Tiberius transferred the last remnant of free elective power to the Senate, whose proposals, originating under imperial influence, were laid before the Comitia for ratification. The formalities, the auspices, prayer, sacrifice, and proclamation, were now the important things, and the measures proposed were carried, not by regular voting, but by acclamation.

<head orig="Commerce">Commerce</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. In the Homeric poems the Greeks are not represented as a people with a spontaneous inclination to commerce. Indeed, the position of the oldest Greek cities, far away from the sea, sufficiently shows that their founders can have had no idea of trade as a means of getting wealth. Greek navigation in ancient times was almost exclusively subservient to war and piracy, to which latter, for a long time, no stigma was attached in public opinion. And the trade carried on with Greece by the Asiatics, especially the Phoenicians, who then ruled the Greek seas, can hardly have been very active. The Greeks, having no agricultural or industrial produce to offer, could not have tempted many foreigners to deal with them. But in the centuries succeeding the Homeric Age the commerce of Greece was revolutionized.</p>
 <p>The islands, especially Aegina and Euboea, were foremost in commercial undertakings; the only continental town which was at all successful in this way being Corinth, which was favoured by its incomparable position. It was the foundation of the Hellenic colonies in Asia Minor that first occasioned the free development of Greek trade. The exertions of the Ionians were mainly instrumental in creating two things indispensable to its success —namely, commercial activity, excited by contact with the ancient industries of the East, and a maritime power in the proper sense, which made it possible to oust the Phoenicians from the naval supremacy which they had so long maintained. This new commercial activity necessitated a larger use of the precious metals and the establishment of a gold and silver coinage, which the Ionians were the first among the Greeks to adopt. This proved a powerful stimulus to the development of commerce, or rather it was the very condition of its existence. Miletus took the first place among the trading colonies. The influence of these cities upon their mother country was so strong that even the Dorians gradually lost their national and characteristic dislike of trade and commerce, and threw themselves actively into their pursuit. Down to the sixth century B.C. Greek commerce had extended itself to the coasts of the Mediterranean and the inland seas connected with it, especially towards the East. It was not until a later time that Athens joined the circle of commercial cities. Even in Solon's time the Athenians had lived mainly by agriculture and cattle-breeding, and it was only with the growth of the democratic constitution that their commercial intercourse with the other cities became at all considerable. The Persian Wars, however, and her position as head of the naval confederacy, raised Athens to the position of the first maritime power in Greece. Under the administration of Pericles she became the centre of all Hellenic activity, not only in art and science, but in trade. It was only Corinth and Corcyra whose western trade enabled them to maintain a prominent position by the side of Athens. The Greeks of Asia Minor completely lost their commercial position after their conquest by the Persians. The naval supremacy of Athens, and with it its commerce, were completely annihilated by the Peloponnesian War. It was a long time before the Athenians succeeded in breaking down the maritime power of Sparta which that war had established. Having done so, they recovered, but only for a short time, a position of prominence not at all equal 
<pb n="394" /><cb />
 to their former supremacy by sea. The victory of the Macedonian power entirely destroyed the political and commercial importance of Athens, whose trade now fell behind that of other cities. The place of Athens, as the first maritime and commercial power, was taken by the city of Rhodes, founded in B.C. 408. By the second half of the fourth century B.C. the trade of Rhodes had extended itself over the whole known world, and its maritime law was universally observed until a much later period. After the destruction of Corinth, in the middle of the second century B.C., the island of Delos enjoyed a brief but brilliant period of prosperity. Among the commercial cities of the Graeco-Macedonian Empire, Alexandria in Egypt took the first place, and rose indeed to be the centre of European and Eastern trade. It was mainly through Alexandria that intercourse was kept up between Greece and the Eastern countries opened up by the campaigns of Alexander the Great.</p>
 <p>One of the most important routes followed by Grecian traffic was that leading to the Black Sea, the coasts of which were fringed with Greek colonies. Besides Byzantium and Sinopé, the chief commercial centres in this region were Olbia, Panticapaeum, Phanagoria, and Phasis, from which trade-routes penetrated far into the barbarian countries of the interior. Other main routes led by Chios and Lesbos to the coasts of Asia Minor and by the Cyclades to that part of the Asiatic coast where lay the great cities of Samos, Ephesus, and Miletus. Hence they continued to Egypt and Cyrené, by Rhodes and Cyprus and the coast of Phoenicia. But in travelling to these parts from the Peloponnesus, men generally sailed by way of Crete, which had been long celebrated for its maritime enterprise. Round the promontory of Malea, the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus, and by Corcyra, they sailed northward to the coasts of the Adriatic, or westward to Italy and Sicily. Regular traffic beyond Sicily was rendered impossible by the jealousy of the Carthaginians and Etruscans, who were masters of the commerce in this region, and whose place was afterwards taken there by the Romans. A considerable land-traffic was carried on by the colonies with barbarians of the interior. But in Greece Proper the mountainous nature of the country and the absence of navigable rivers were unfavourable to communication by land, and the land-traffic accordingly was entirely thrown into the shade by the maritime trade. The only opportunity for commerce by land on a large scale was afforded by the great national festivals, which brought together great crowds of people from every part of Greece, and secured them a safe conduct. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossekecheiria">Ekecheiria</ref>.) In this way these festivals exactly corresponded to the trade fairs of modern Europe.</p>
 <p>The exports of Greece consisted mainly of wine, oil, and manufactured goods, especially pottery and metal wares. The imports included the necessaries of life, of which Greece itself, with its dense population, artificially increased by slavery, did not produce a sufficient quantity. The staple was wheat, which was imported in large quantities from the coasts of the Black Sea, Egypt, and Sicily. Next came wood for houses and for ships, and raw materials of all kind for manufacture. The foreign manufactures imported were mostly <cb /> objects of Inxury. Finally we should mention the large number of imported slaves.</p>
 <p>Comparing the circumstances of the aucient Greek maritime commerce with those of modern trade, we may observe that the ancients were much hampered by having no commission agencies and no system of exchange. The proprietor of the cargo sailed with it, or sent a representative with full powers. No transaction was carried on without payment in ready money, which was often rendered difficult by the existence of different systems of coinage. With uncivilized tribes, notably those on the Black Sea, a system of barter long maintained itself. As no goods could be bought without cash payments, and men of property generally preferred to lend out their capital to borrowers at high interest, a system of bottomry was extensively developed in Greek maritime trade. The creditor usually took care, in lending the capital necessary for loading the ship, to secure a lien on the ship or the cargo—or both. With this he undertook the risks of the business, charging interest at a very high rate, generally twenty to thirty per cent. The written contract contained other specifications as to the ship and the rate of interest, for the breach of which certain customary penalties were fixed. These had reference to the destination of the ship and, generally speaking, to the route and the time to be occupied; to the character and value of the wares, and to the repayment of the loan—the latter to determine whether it should be made on the ship's arriving at its destination or on its return home. In the first case the creditor would often sail with the ship, if he had no representative on the spot or at the port for which she was bound.</p>
 <p>At Athens, and no doubt in other cities, the interests of the creditor were protected by a strict code of laws. Fraudulent appropriation of a deposit was punishable with death; dilatoriness in payment with imprisonment. The creditor was allowed to seize not only the security, but the whole property of the debtor. In other respects Athenian legislation secured several advantages to traders. Commercial cases came before the law courts in winter only, when navigation was impossible, and they had to be decided within a month. In ordinary cases of debt, the creditor could only seize on the debtor's property; but in commercial cases he was liable to be imprisoned if condemned to payment. In other matters aliens had to be represented in court by a citizen; in commercial cases they could appear in person. It was the duty of the Thesmothetae to see to the preparation of these cases. The trial was carried on and the verdict given by a special tribunal, the <foreign lang="greek">ναυτοδίκαι</foreign> (q. v.). Merchants could easily obtain the considerable privilege of exemption from military service, though they were not legally entitled to it.</p>
 <p>In general, it may be said that the Greek States, in consideration of the importance of trade, went very far in providing for its interests. They did their best to secure its safety and independence by force of arms, and concluded treaties with the same end in view. This is especially true of those agreements which regulated the legal relations of the citizens of any two States in their intercourse with each other, and prescribed the forms to be observed by the citizens of one State when bringing 
<pb n="395" /><cb /> suits against those of another. The institution of <foreign lang="greek">πρόξενοι</foreign>, corresponding to that of the modern consuls, was of immense benefit to the trading community. The Greek governments did a great deal in the way of constructing harbours, warehouses, and buildings for exchange in the neighbourhood of the harbours. The superintendence of the harbour traffic, like that of the market traffic, was intrusted to special government officials; in Athens, for instance, to the ten overseers of the <foreign lang="greek">Ἐμπόριον</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossagoranomi">Agoranomi</ref>.) The Athenians had also a special board, called <foreign lang="greek">μετρονόμοι</foreign>, to see that the weights and measures were correct. It was only in exceptional cases that the freedom of trade was interfered with by monopolies, nor was it usual to lay prohibitions upon imports. Prohibitions of exportation were, however, much commoner. In many States, as e. g. in Macedonia, it was forbidden to export building materials, especially wood for ship-building; and no grain might be exported from Attica. Again, no Athenian merchant was permitted to carry corn to any harbour but that of Athens; no citizen or resident alien could lend money on the security of ships carrying corn to any place but Athens. Even foreigners who came with corn into the harbour of Athens were compelled to deposit two-thirds of it for sale there. To prevent excessive profits being realized in the corn trade, it was made a capital offence for any private citizen to buy up more than fifty bushels at a time, or sell it at a profit of more than an obolus a bushel. The corn trade was under the superintendence of a board called <foreign lang="greek">σιτοφύλακες</foreign>. In the prevailing activity of commerce, the tolls on exports and imports were a plentiful source of revenue to the government. See <ref type="cross" target="crossportorium">Portorium</ref>.</p>
 <p>In Greek society, petty trading was thought a vulgar and sordid pursuit, and was left to the poorer citizens and resident aliens (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>). In Athens the class of resident aliens included a great number of the larger dealers; for the wealthier and more respectable citizens liked lending their capital to others engaged in trade better than engaging in trade themselves.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. In Italy an active commerce was early carried on at sea by the Etruscans, the other Italian peoples taking only a passive part in it. But Rome, from a very early time, became the commercial centre of Central Italy. It was situated on a river deep enough to admit large vessels, the upper course and tributaries of which were also navigable. Its position was much improved by the harbour at the colony of Ostia, said to have been constructed under Ancus Marcius. So long as the Etrnscans and Carthaginians and (as in later times) the Greek cities of southern Italy and Sicily, like Tarentum and Syracuse, ruled the sea, the maritime power and commerce of Rome were restricted within very narrow limits. Even as late as the middle of the fourth century B.C. the traffic of Rome was confined to Sardinia, Sicily, and Africa. But with the extension of the Roman power, Roman commerce assumed wider dimensions. At the end of the republican period Roman ships were on every sea, and there was a flourishing interior trade in Italy and all the provinces. Wherever there was a navigable river it was used for communication, with the happiest results. After the Second Punic War, Rome gradually acquired the character of a great commercial city, where the products of the whole <cb /> world, natural and industrial, found a market. The most considerable import was corn, and this at all periods of Roman history. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossannona">Annona</ref>.) The chief exports of Italy were wine and oil, to which we must add, after the development of Italian industry, manufactured goods. The tradingharbour of Rome was Puteoli (Pozzuoli), on the Bay of Naples, while Ostia was used mainly by corn-ships. Petty dealing was regarded unfavourably by the Romans, as by the Greeks; but trade on a large scale was thought quite respectable, though in older times members of the Senate were not allowed to engage in it. Most of the larger undertakings at Rome were in the hands of joint-stock companies (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspublicani">Publicani</ref>), the existence of which made it possible for small capitalists to share in the profits and risks of commerce. It was indeed an old maxim of business men at Rome that it was better to have small shares in a number of speculations than to speculate independently. The corn trade, in particular, was in the hands of these companies. The government allowed them to transport corn from Sardinia, Sicily, Spain, Africa, and Egypt to Rome; whole fleets of vessels, constructed for the purpose, being appointed to this service. Foreign trade was subjected to a number of restrictions. The exportation of certain products was absolutely prohibited—for instance, iron, whether unwrought or manufactured, arms, coin, salt, and gold—and duties were levied on all imports. There were also numerous restrictions on trade in the interior, as each province formed a unit of taxation, in which toll had to be paid on entering or leaving it. Among the State monopolies, the most important was that of salt.</p>

 <head><surname full="yes">Commŏdus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">L. Aurelius Antonīnus</foreName>
 <p>The son and successor of M. Aurelius Antoninus, who ascended the imperial throne A.D. 180. The reign of this prince is a scene of guilt and misery, which the historian is glad to dismiss with brevity. He appears, indeed, to have inherited all the vices of his mother, Faustina; and his father, in selecting him for his successor, allowed the feelings of the parent to triumph over the wisdom of the magistrate. He had accompanied his father on the expedition against the Marcomanni and the Quadi, but no sooner was Aurelius dead than his son became anxious to proceed to Rome, and soon concluded a hasty and disgraceful peace with the barbarians whom his father had been on the point of completely subjugating when he was cut off by disease. Notwithstanding the care which Aurelius had bestowed on his education, Commodus was ignorant to an extreme degree, having neither abilities nor inclination for profiting by the paternal example and instruction. On his return to Rome he speedily showed the bias of his natural disposition, giving himself up to unrestrained indulgence in the grossest vices. That he might do so without impediment, he intrusted all power to Perennis, praefect of the Praetorian Guard, a man of stern and cruel temper, who was at last slain by the soldiers for his severity.</p>
 <p>A conspiracy against the life of Commodus having failed, it was followed by a long succession of judicial murders to gratify the vengeance of the cowardly and vindictive tyrant. He was next threatened by a new danger: disaffection had spread over the legions; and an attempt of Maternus, a private soldier, who headed a band of deserters and projected the assassination of Commodus during the celebration of the festival of Cybelé, was so ably conceived that it must have been successful but for the treachery of an accomplice. But neither duty nor danger could draw Commodus from the sports of gladiators or the pleasures of debauchery. Cleander, a Phrygian <cb /> slave, soon succeeded to the place and influence of Perennis, and for three years the Empire groaned <figure id="fig.00396">
<head orig="Commodus. (Bust in the Capitoline Museum, Rome.)">Commodus. (Bust in the Capitoline Museum, Rome.)</head>
</figure> beneath his cruelty and rapacity. At length a new insurrection burst forth, which nothing could allay, the praetorian cavalry being defeated in the streets by the populace, until the unworthy favourite was, by the emperor's command, delivered to the insurgents. In the meantime, Commodus was indulging his base tastes and appetites, not only by gross sensuality, but by attempting to rival the gladiators. Being a very skilful archer and of great personal strength, he delighted in killing wild beasts in the amphitheatre, and thus pretending to rival the prowess of Hercules. In the gladiatorial contests, he publicly engaged so often that he was the conqueror in 735 combats. Though luxurious in his dress, frequently resorting to the baths eight times in the day, scattering gold dust in his hair, and, from the fear of admitting the approach of a razor in the hand of another, singeing off his beard, he was especially proud of exhibitions of personal strength, and frequently, in the garb of a priest, butchered victims with his own hands. Among the flatteries of the obsequious Senate none pleased him more than the vote which styled him the “Hercules of Rome,” not even that which decreed to him the titles of Pius and Felix, or which offered to abolish the name of the Eternal City and substitute for it the title Colonia Commodiana. After thirteen years of unmitigated oppression, his favourite, Marcia, ultimately became the instrument by which the Roman world was delivered from its odious master. She discovered, from some private notes of Commodus, that herself, Laetus the praetorian praefect, and Eclectus the chamberlain, were on the list devoted to death. A conspiracy was immediately formed, Marcia administered poison to the emperor, and, lest the measure should not prove effectual, the deed was completed by suffocation, in A.D. 192. The life of Commodus has come down to us, written by Lampridius, in the <title>Historia Augusta.</title>

<div2 id="crosscomoedia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Comoedia">Comoedia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κωμῳδία</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The Greek comedy, like the Greek tragedy and satyric drama, had its origin in the festivals of Dionysus. As its name, <foreign lang="greek">κωμῳδία</foreign>, or the song of the <foreign lang="greek">κῶμος</foreign>, implies, it arose from the unrestrained singing and jesting common in the <foreign lang="greek">κῶμος</foreign>, or merry procession of Dionysus. According to the tradition, it was the Doric inhabitants of Megara, well known for their love of fun, who first worked up these jokes into a kind of farce. The inhabitants of Megara accordingly boasted that they were the founders of Greek comedy. From Megara, it was supposed, the popular farce found its way to the other Dorian communities, and one Susarion was said to have transplanted it to the Attic deme of Icaria about B.C. 580. No further information is in existence as to the nature of the Megarian or Dorian popular comedy. The local Doric farce was developed into literary form in Sicily by Epicharmus of Cos (about B.C. 540-450). This writer gave a comic treatment not only to mythology, but to subjects taken from real life. The contemporary of Epicharmus, Phormus or Phormis, and his pupil Dinolochus, may also be named as representatives of the Dorian comedy.</p>
 <p>The beginnings of the Attic comedy, like those of the Attic tragedy, are associated with the deme of Icaria, known to have been the chief seat of the worship of Dionysus in Attica. Not only Thespis , the father of tragedy, but also Chionides and Magnes (about B.C. 550), who, if the story may be trusted, first gave a more artistic form to the Megarian comedy, introduced by Susarion, were natives of Icaria. Comedy did not become, in the proper sense, a part of literature until it had found welcome and consideration at Athens in the time of the Persian Wars; until its form had been moulded on the finished outlines of tragedy; and until, finally, it had received from the State the same recognition as tragedy. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstragoedia">Tragoedia</ref>.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Old Comedy</hi>, as it was called, had its origin in personal abuse. It was Crates who first gave it its peculiar political character, and his younger contemporary, Cratinus, who turned it mainly or exclusively in this direction. The masters of the Old Comedy are usually held to be Cratinus and his younger contemporaries, Eupolis and Aristophanes. It attained its youth in the time of Pericles and the Peloponnesian War—the period when the Athenian democracy had reached its highest development. These three masters had many rivals—who fell, however, on the whole beneath their level—among others Pherecrates, Hermippus, Teleclides, Phrynichus, Ameipsias, Plato, and Theopompus.</p>
 <p>A good idea of the characteristics of the Old Comedy may be formed from the eleven surviving plays of <ref type="cross" target="crossaristophanes">Aristophanes</ref> (q.v.). The Greek tragedy has a meaning for all time; but the Old Comedy, the most brilliant and striking production of all Athenian literature, has its roots in Athenian life, and addressed the Athenian public only.</p>
 <p>Dealing from the very first with the grotesque and absurd side of things, it was the scourge of all <cb /> vice, folly, and weakness. The social life of Athens, so restless and yet so open, offered an inexhaustible store of material; and the comedian was always sure of a witty, laughter-loving public, on whom no allusion was lost. The first aim of the Athenian comedy was, no doubt, to make men laugh, but this was not all. Beneath it there lay a serious and patriotic motive. The poet, who was secured by the license of the stage, wished to bring to light and turn to ridicule the abuses and degeneracy of his time. The Attic comedians are all admirers of the good old times, and accordingly the declared enemies of the social innovations which were beginning to make their way—the signs in many cases, no doubt, of approaching decline. It was not, however, the actual phenomena of life which were sketched in the Old Comedy. The latter is really a grotesque and fantastic caricature; the colours are laid on thick, and propriety, as we moderns understand it, is thrown to the winds. These plays abound in coarseness and obscenity of the broadest kind, the natural survival of the rude license allowed at the Dionysiac festival. The choice and treatment of the subjects show the same tendency to the grotesque and fantastic. Fancy and caprice revel at their will, unchecked by any regard either for the laws of poetical probability or for adequacy of occasion. The action is generally quite simple, sketched out in a few broad strokes, and carried out in a motley series of loosely connected scenes. The language is always choice and fine, never leaving the forms of the purest Atticism. The metres admit a greater freedom and movement than those of the tragedy.</p>
 <p>A comedy, like a tragedy, consisted of the dramatic dialogue, written mostly in iambic senarii, and the lyrical chorus. The division of the dialogue into <foreign lang="greek">πρόλογος, ἐπεισόδιον</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἔξοδος</foreign>, and of the chorus into <foreign lang="greek">πάροδος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">στάσιμα</foreign>, are the same as in tragedy. But, while the tragic chorus consisted of fifteen singers, there were twenty-four in the comic. A peculiarity of the comic chorus is the <foreign lang="greek">παράβασις</foreign>, a series of lines entirely unconnected with the plot, in which the poet, through the mouth of the chorus, addresses the public directly about his own concerns or upon burning questions of the day. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossparabasis">Parabasis</ref>.) Like the tragedies, the comedies were performed at the great festivals of Dionysus, the <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref> (q.v.) and the <ref type="cross" target="crosslenaea">Lenaea</ref> (q.v.). On each occasion five poets competed for the prize, each with one play.</p>
 <p>For a short time, but a short time only, a limitation had been put upon the absolute freedom with which the poets of the Old Comedy lashed the shortcomings of the government and its chief men. The downfall of the democracy, however, deprived them of this liberty. The disastrous issue of the Peloponnesian War had, moreover, ruined the Athenian finances, and made it necessary to give up the expensive chorus and with it the <foreign lang="greek">παράβασις</foreign>. Thus deprived of the means of existence, the Old Comedy was doomed to extinction. In its place came what was called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Middle Comedy</hi>, from about B.C. 400 to 338. This was a modification of the Old Comedy, with a character corresponding to the altered circumstance of the time. The Middle Comedy was in no sense political; it avoided all open attack on individuals, and confined itself to treating the typical faults and weaknesses of mankind. Its main line was burlesque and parody, of which the objects 
<pb n="398" /><cb />
 were the tragedies and the mythology in general. It was also severe upon the lives of the philosophers. It dealt in typical characters, such as bullies, parasites, and courtesans. The writers of the Middle Comedy were very prolific, more than eight hundred of their plays having survived as late as the second century A.D. The most celebrated of them were Antiphanes of Athens and Alexis of Thurii; next to these came Eubulus, and Anaxandrides of Rhodes.</p>
 <p>A new departure is signalized by the dramas of what is called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">New Comedy</hi>. In these, as in the modern society drama, life was represented in its minutest details. The New Comedy offered a play regularly constructed like that of tragedy, characterized by fine humour, and but seldom touching on public life. The language was that of ordinary society, and the plot was worked out in a connected form from the beginning to the dénouement. The chief art of the poets of the New Comedy lay in the development of the plot and the faithful portraiture of character. The stock subjects are illicit love affairs; for honest women lived in retirement, and stories of honourable love, therefore, were practically excluded from the stage. The ordinary characters are young men in love, fathers of the good-natured or the scolding type, cunning slaves, panders, parasites, and bragging officers. Besides the dialogue proper, we find traces of parts written in lyric metres for the higher style of singing. These were, in all probability, like the dialogue, performed by the actors.</p>
 <p>The fate of the New resembles that of the Middle Comedy, only a few fragments of its numerous pieces having survived. Of some of them, however, we have Latin adaptations by Plautus and Terence. Its greatest master was Menander, besides whom should be mentioned Diphilus, Philemon, Philippides, Posidippus, and Apollodorus of Carystus. The New Comedy flourished from B.C. 330 till far into the third century A.D.</p>
 <p>In about B.C. 300, the old Dorian farce was revived in a literary form in Southern Italy by Rhinthon, the creator of the <title>Hilarotragoedia</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱλαροτραγῳδία</foreign>). The <title>Hilarotragoedia</title> was for the most part a parody of the tragic stories. It is also called, from its creator, <title>fabula Rhinthonica.</title></p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. Like the Greeks, the Italian people had their popular dramatic pieces—the <title>versus Fescennini</title>, for instance, which were at first introduced, in B.C. 390, from Etruria, in consequence of a plague, to appease the wrath of heaven. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfescennina">Fescennini Versus</ref>.) From this combination sprang the <seg lang="la">satura</seg>, a performance consisting of flute-playing, mimic dance, songs, and dialogue. The <title>Atellanae Fabulae</title> (q. v.) were a second species of popular Italian comedy, distinguished from others by having certain fixed or stock characters. The creator of the regular Italian comedy and tragedy was a Greek named Livius Andronicus, about B.C. 240. Like the Italian tragedy, the Italian comedy was, in form and contents, an imitation, executed with more or less freedom, of the Greek. It was the New Greek Comedy which the Romans took as their model. This comedy, which represents scenes from Greek life, was called <seg lang="la">palliata</seg>, after the Greek <seg lang="la">pallium</seg>, or cloak. The dramatic <seg lang="la">satura</seg> and the <title>Atellana</title>, which afterwards supplanted the <seg lang="la">satura</seg> as a concluding farce, continued to exist side by side. The Latin comedy was brought to perfection by Plautus and Terence, the only Roman <cb /> dramatists from whose hands we still possess complete plays. We should also mention Naevius and Ennius (both of whom wrote tragedies as well as comedies), Caecilius, and Turpilius, with whom, towards the end of the third century B.C., this style of composition died out.</p>
 <p>About the middle of the second century B.C., a new kind of comedy, the <seg lang="la">fabula togata</seg> (from <seg lang="la">toga</seg>), made its appearance. The form of it was still Greek, but the life and the characters Italian. The <seg lang="la">togata</seg> was represented by Titinius, Atta , and Afranins, who were accounted masters in this kind of writing. At the beginning of the first century B.C., the <title>Atellana</title> assumed an artistic form in the hands of Pomponius and Novius; and some fifty years later the <seg lang="la">mimus</seg>, also an old form of popular farce, was similarly handled by Laberius and Publilius Syrus. The <seg lang="la">mimus</seg> drove all the other varieties of comedy from the field, and held its ground until late in the imperial period. See Fabula; <ref type="cross" target="crossmimus">Mimus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspantomimus">Pantomimus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssatira">Satira</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Roman comedy, like its model, the New Comedy of the Greeks, had no regular chorus, the intervals being filled up by performances on the flute. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>.) The play consisted, like the Roman tragedy, partly of passages of spoken dialogue (<seg lang="la">diverbia</seg>) in iambic trimeters, partly of musical scenes called <seg lang="la">cantica.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanticum">Canticum</ref>.</p>

<head orig="Compitalia">Compitalia</head>

 <p> also called <hi rend="bold">Ludi Compitalicii.</hi> A festival celebrated once a year in honour of the two Lares Compitales, to whom sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways met (<seg lang="la">compita</seg>). Dionysius (iv. 14) similarly ascribes its origin to Servius Tullius, and describes the festival as it was celebrated in his time. He relates that the sacrifices consisted of honey-cakes (<foreign lang="greek">πέλανοι</foreign>), which were presented by the inhabitants of each house, and that the persons who assisted as ministering servants at the festival were not freemen, but slaves, because the Lares took pleasure in the service of slaves. He further adds that the Compitalia were celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia with great splendour, and that the slaves on this occasion had full liberty given them to do what they pleased. We are told by Macrobius (<title>Saturn.</title> i. 7, 34) that the celebration of the Compitalia was restored by Tarquinius Superbus, who sacrificed boys to Mania, the mother of the Lares; but this practice was changed after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and the heads of garlic and poppies were offered instead of human heads. 
<pb n="399" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The persons who presided over the festival were the <seg lang="la">magistri vicorum.</seg> Public games were added at some time during the republican period to this festival, but were suppressed by command of the Senate in B.C. 64. Yet that the festival itself still continued to be observed, though the games were abolished, is evident from Cicero (<title>ad Att.</title> iii. 3). When Iulius Caesar dissolved most of the <seg lang="la">collegia</seg>, the Compitalia necessarily fell into disuse. Augustus restored the festival on an entirely new basis, not reviving the <seg lang="la">collegia</seg>, but assigning the charge of it to a newly constituted set of <seg lang="la">magistri vicorum.</seg> To the two Lares Compitales was now added the <title>genius Augusti</title> (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5. 145" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>v. 145</bibl>), and the festival was observed twice in the year, on May 1 and August 1. At an earlier time the Compitalia belonged to the <seg lang="la">feriae conceptivae;</seg> that is, festivals which were celebrated on days appointed annually by the magistrates or priests. The day on which this festival was celebrated appears to have been always in the winter.

 <p> An assembly in general, sometimes used in a loose way to designate the comitia of the centuries ( <bibl n="Liv.  2. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ii. 28</bibl>), or any <seg lang="la">contio.</seg> For the <seg lang="la">concilium plebis</seg>, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>. The word also denotes the assemblies or meetings of confederate towns or nations, at which either their deputies alone, or any of the citizens who had time and inclination, met, and thus formed a representative assembly ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 50</bibl>). We find frequent traces of this, not only among the Italian nations, but also in the Greek States (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ κοινόν</foreign>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crossachaean-league">Achaean League</ref>.) As the Romans conquered the neighbouring States of Italy, it was a regular part of their policy to break up the union of the vanquished tribes by forbidding the existence of such <seg lang="la">concilia</seg> ( <bibl n="Liv.  8. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.viii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  10" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 10</bibl>). But Augustus not merely allowed the <seg lang="la">concilia</seg> to continue where they had previously been held, but instituted them also in other provinces; and this representative character was recognized. In theory, they were associations fermed for the worship of the imperial house. The president was the <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιερεύς</foreign>, or <seg lang="la">sacerdos provinciae</seg>, <cb /> an official elected annually by the deputies (<seg lang="la">legati</seg>) from the most important towns. This dignitary was usually one of the most eminent and wealthy of the provincials, and had the immediate direction of the finances of the temple and its festivals; at a later time he had a certain power of control over all the priests of the province. After the concilium had taken part in the religious festival, it met again for the conduct of business. Its first duty was to pass the accounts of the expenditure connected with the provincial temple to Augustus, and to provide for the maintenance of the worship for the coming year; but then it was entitled to criticise the conduct of the governor, and either vote thanks to him or lay a complaint before the emperor (cf. the Inscription of Torigny, edited by Mommsen), which was frequently followed by his accusation ( <title>Epist.</title> vii. 6). In this manner some control was exercised over the governor, and there was some approach to the creation of a representative body. See Marquardt, <title>Röm. Staatsverw.</title> i. 503-516, and his important essay in the <bibl default="NO"><title>Ephem. Epigr.</title> (1872)</bibl>, pp. 200-214.

<div2 id="crossconcubina" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Concubīna">Concubina</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παλλακή, παλλακίς</foreign>). A concubine. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The <foreign lang="greek">παλλακή</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">παλλακίς</foreign> occupied at Athens a kind of middle rank between the wife and the harlot (<foreign lang="greek">ἑταίρα</foreign>). Demosthenes defines the position of each by saying that the harlot ministers to pleasure only, the concubine serves, while the wife is for the purpose of bearing children and acting as the faithful steward of her husband's goods (<title>c. Neaer.</title> 122, p. 1386). Thus Antiphon speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">παλλακή</foreign> of Philoneos as following him to the sacrifice, and also waiting upon him and his guest at table. If her person were violated by force, the same penalty was exigible from the ravisher as if the offence had been committed upon an Attic matron; and a man surprised by the quasi-husband in the act of criminal intercourse with his <foreign lang="greek">παλλακή</foreign>, might be slain by him on the spot, as in the parallel case. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossadulterium">Adulterium</ref>.) It does not, however, appear very clearly from what political classes concubines were chiefly selected, as cohabitation with a foreign (<foreign lang="greek">ξένη</foreign>) woman was strictly forbidden by law, and the provisions made by the State for virgins of Attic families must, in most cases, have prevented their sinking to this condition. Sometimes, certainly, where there were several destitute female orphans, this might take place, as the next of kin was not obliged to provide for more than one; and we may also conceive the same to have occurred with respect to the 
<pb n="400" /><cb />
 daughters of families so poor as to be unable to supply a dowry. The dowry, in fact, seems to have been a decisive criterion as to whether the connection between a male and a female Athenian, in a state of cohabitation, amounted to a marriage. If no dowry had been given, the child of such union would be illegitimate; if, on the contrary, a dowry had been given, or a proper instrument executed in acknowledgment of its receipt, the woman was fully entitled to all conjugal rights. It does not appear that the slave who was taken to her master's bed acquired any political rights in consequence; the concubine mentioned by Antiphon is treated as a slave by her master, and after his death undergoes a servile punishment.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. According to an old definition, an unmarried woman who cohabited with a man was originally called <hi rend="italic">pellex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">paelex</hi> ( <bibl n="Gel.  4. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iv. 3</bibl>), but afterwards by the more decent appellation of <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> (<title>Dig.</title> 50, 16, 144). <title>Concubinatus</title> is cohabitation other than marriage between free persons who were both unmarried, or between an unmarried free man and an <seg lang="la">ancilla.</seg> In the older times this was viewed as an offence deserving punishment ( <bibl n="Liv.  10. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.x. 31</bibl>; xxv. 2); but when the possibility of a lasting affection between persons who had not <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> came to be recognized, the cohabitation of an unmarried man with his <seg lang="la">liberta</seg> or <seg lang="la">ancilla</seg> (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 3. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epid.</title>iii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Epid. 29" default="NO" valid="yes"> Epid., 29</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Epid. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> Epid., 30</bibl>) was regarded without censure. In Cicero's time ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 1. 40. 183" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>De Orat.</title>i. 40. 183</bibl>) the name of <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> would have applied to a woman who cohabited with a man who had not divorced his wife; but this was not considered lawful concubinage in after-times. The Lex Iulia de Adulteriis of Augustus imposed severe penalties on <seg lang="la">adulterium, incestus</seg>, and <seg lang="la">stuprum</seg> (q. v.); but by the Lex Iulia and Papia Poppaea <seg lang="la">concubinatus</seg> was legalized and exempted from the penal provisions of the earlier statute (<title>Dig.</title> 25, 7, 3, 1), though an <seg lang="la">honesta femina</seg> who wished to become a <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> was not dispensed from them unless she made an express declaration of her intention or <seg lang="la">testatio</seg> (<title>Dig.</title> ib. 3, pr.). But a man who already had an <seg lang="la">uxor</seg> could not have a <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> at the same time (<title>Dig.</title> 50, 16, 144), nor apparently could a man have more than one <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> at a time; and widowers who already had children, and did not wish to contract another legal marriage, took a <seg lang="la">concubina</seg>, as we see in the case of Vespasian ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 3" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>3</bibl>), Antoninus Pius, and M. Aurelius.</p>
 <p><title>Concubinatus</title> differed from lawful marriage in three especial respects. (1) In the relation of the parties, there being no <seg lang="la">affectio maritalis</seg> ( <title>Sent. Rec.</title> ii. 20).</p>
 <p>(2) In the loss of reputation to the woman if <seg lang="la">honesta.</seg> Yet there is an inscription in Fabretti (p. 337) to the memory of Paullianus by Aemilia Prima, <seg lang="la">concubina eius et heres</seg>, which seems to show that the term <seg lang="la">concubina</seg> was not one that a woman need be ashamed of.</p>
 <p>(3) In its legal effects: it was not a marriage, and therefore the rules as to <seg lang="la">dos, donatio propter nuptias, donatio inter virum et uxorem</seg>, had no application; nor were the children in <seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg>, though their paternity was recognized; they could be legitimated, and under the emperors were entitled to maintenance, even from the legitimate children after the father's death ( <bibl n="Just. Nov. 89" default="NO"> <title>Nov.</title>89</bibl><bibl n="Just. Nov. 12" default="NO"> Nov., 12</bibl><bibl n="Just. Nov. 6" default="NO"> Nov., 6</bibl>); also, they had some rights of succession on the father's dying intestate.</p>
 <p>By later emperors <seg lang="la">concubinatus</seg> was discouraged, but it was not made generally unlawful until the ninth century, by Leo the Philosopher. <cb /></p>
 <p>Cohabitation between two slaves was called <seg lang="la">contubernium</seg>, a name also applied to that between a slave and a free person ( <bibl n="Paul.  2. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul.ii. 19</bibl><bibl n="Paul.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul., 6</bibl>).

 <p> Properly the mixing of liquids, or the fusing of metals into one mass. If things of the same or of different kind were confused, either by the consent of both owners or by accident, the compound was the property of both. If the <seg lang="la">confusio</seg> was caused by one without the consent of the other, the compound was only joint property in case the things were of the same kind and perhaps of the same quality—as, for instance, wines of the same quality. If the things were different, so that the compound was a new thing, this was a case of what, by modern writers, is called <hi rend="italic">specificatio</hi>, which the Roman writers expressed by the term <seg lang="la">novam speciem facere</seg>, as if a man made <seg lang="la">mulsum</seg> out of his own wine and his neighbour's honey. In such a case the person who caused the <seg lang="la">confusio</seg> became the owner of the compound, but he was bound to make good to the other the value of his property.</p>
 <p><title>Commixtio</title> applies to cases such as mixing together two heaps of corn; but this is not an instance in which either party acquires property by the <seg lang="la">commixtio.</seg> For if the mixture takes place, either accidentally or with mutual consent, or by the act of one alone, in all these cases the property of each person continues as before, for in all these cases it is capable of separation. A case of <seg lang="la">commixtio</seg> arises when a man's money is paid without his knowledge and consent, and the money, when paid, is so mixed with other money that it cannot be recognized; otherwise it remains the property of the person to whom it belonged.</p>
 <p>Two things, the property of two persons, might become so united as not to be separable without injury to one or both; in this case, the owner of the principal thing became the owner of the accessory. 
<pb n="401" /><cb /> Thus, in the case of a man building on another man's ground, the building belonged to the owner of the ground (<seg lang="la">superficies solo cedit</seg>); or in the case of a tree planted, or seed sown on another man's ground, the rule was the same. If a man wrote, even in letters of gold, on another man's parchment or paper, the whole belonged to the owner of the parchment or paper; in the case of a picture painted on another man's canvas, the canvas became the property of the owner of the picture.</p>
 <p>But in all these cases the losing party was entitled to compensation, with some exceptions as to cases of <seg lang="la">mala fides.</seg>

 <p> (sc. <seg lang="la">vas;</seg> from <seg lang="la">congius</seg>). (1) A vessel containing a <seg lang="la">congius</seg> (q. v.).
 </p>
 <p>(2) In the early times of the Roman Republic, the <seg lang="la">congius</seg> was the usual measure of oil or wine which was, on certain occasions, distributed among the people; and thus <seg lang="la">congiarium</seg>, as Quintilian says, became a name for the gift as well as for the measure (<seg lang="la">congiarium commune liberalitatis atque mensurae</seg>, vi. 3. 52). It does not follow that all the citizens or even heads of families received a <seg lang="la">congius</seg> apiece. The earliest mention of a distribution of oil is in B.C. 213, when two Cornelii Scipiones, afterwards called Africanus and Cethegus, in their aedileship gave a certain number of <seg lang="la">congii</seg> (the numeral has dropped out) to the inhabitants of each street (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 2</bibl>, with Madvig's note). Lucullus on returning from his Eastern victories distributed more than 100,000 casks of wine to the people ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14.  96" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 96</bibl>). The name <seg lang="la">congiarium</seg> was also applied, less accurately, to presents of corn or other provisions.</p>
 <p>Under the Empire the tranquillity of the capital was insured by a gigantic system of outdoor relief (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfrumentariae-leges">Frumentariae Leges</ref>), supplemented by frequent doles. The general term for these imperial presents is <seg lang="la">largitio</seg>, sometimes (especially on coins) <seg lang="la">liberalitas.</seg> Distributions to the soldiers were called <seg lang="la">donativa</seg>, to the people <seg lang="la">congiaria;</seg> but sometimes the former also are called <seg lang="la">congiaria</seg> ( <title>Ad Att.</title> xvi. 8). The sums thus spent were enormous. Hadrian's congiarium was three <seg lang="la">aurei</seg> per head on his proclamation as emperor, and double that amount on his arrival in Rome; Commodus gave 725 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> to each citizen. Marquardt has computed the imperial congiaria at an average of $450,000 a year from Iulius Caesar to Claudius, $1,500,000 a year from Nero to Septimius Severus; it must have been, however, a periodical emptying of the treasury rather than a continuous drain.</p>
 <p><title>Congiarium</title> was, moreover, used to designate presents or pensions given by men of rank to <figure id="fig.00401">

 <p>There is a congius in existence, known as the Farnese congius, but now at Dresden, bearing an inscription which states that it was made in the year A.D. 75, according <cb /> to the standard measure in the Capitol, and that it contained, by weight, ten pounds.

<head orig="Conon">Conon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κόνων</foreign>). (1) A distinguished Athenian commander, and one of the generals who succeeded Alcibiades in the command of the fleet during the Peloponnesian War. Having engaged Callicratidas, the Spartan admiral, he lost thirty vessels, and was compelled to take shelter in the harbour of Mytilené, where he was blockaded by his opponent. The victory gained by the Athenians at the Arginusae released him at length from his situation. Being subsequently appointed, with five others, to the command of a powerful fleet, he proceeded to the Hellespont, where Lysander had charge of the Lacedaemonian squadron. The negligence of his fellow-commanders, the result of overweening confidence in their own strength, led to the fatal defeat at Aegos Potamos, and the whole Athenian fleet was taken, except nine vessels of Conon 's division, with eight of which, thinking that the war was now desperate, he sailed to Salamis in the island of Cyprus. The ninth vessel was sent to Athens with the tidings of the defeat. In Cyprus, Conon remained at the court of Evagoras, watching for an opportunity to prove of service to his country. Such a state of affairs soon presented itself. The Lacedaemonians, having no more rivals in Greece, sent Agesilaüs with an army into Asia to make war upon the Persian king. Conon immediately repaired to Pharnabazus, the satrap of Lydia and Ionia, aided him with his counsels, and suggested to him the idea of exciting the Thebans and other Grecian communities against Sparta, so as to compel that State to recall Agesilaüs from the East. The plan was approved of by the king of Persia, and Conon , at the head of a Persian fleet, B.C. 394, attacked the Spartan admiral, Pisander, near Cnidus, and defeated him, with the loss of the greater part of his ships. Lacedaemon immediately lost the control of the sea, and her power in Asia Minor ceased. Conon thereupon, after ravaging the coasts of Laconia, returned to Attica, rebuilt the city walls as well as those of the Piraeus, with means which had been furnished by Pharnabazus, and gave on this occasion a public entertainment to all the Athenians. The Lacedaemonians, dispirited by the success of Conon , and alarmed at the re-establishment of the Athenian fortifications, sent Antalcidas to Tiribazus, one of the Persian generals, to negotiate a peace. The Athenians, on their part, deputed Conon and some others to oppose this attempt; but Tiribazus being favourably inclined towards Sparta, and in all probability jealous of 
<pb n="402" /><cb />
 Pharnabazus, imprisoned Conon , under the pretext that he was endeavouring to excite an insurrection in Aeolis and Ionia. The Persian king, however, disapproved of the conduct of the satrap, and Conon was released. The latter thereupon returned to the island of Cyprus, where he fell sick and died, about B.C. 390. His remains were conveyed to Athens ( <title>Conon;</title> <title>Hist. Gr.</title> i. 4, 10; id. ib. ii. 1, 21, etc.).</p>

 <p> A council, or body of advisers. Such councils were called in, according to ancient Roman custom, by the presiding magistrate in civil and criminal cases.

The custom was that the presiding judge bound himself by the decision of his freely chosen <seg lang="la">consilium</seg>, but took the responsibility himself. The expression <seg lang="la">consilium</seg> was afterwards transferred to the regular juries of the courts which decided civil and criminal cases. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscentumviri">Centumviri</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossiudices">Iudices</ref>.) The emperors, too, made a practice of inviting a consilium of friends to assist them in their judicial decisions. After the time of Hadrian, the members of the imperial consilium or <seg lang="la">consistorium</seg> appear as regularly appointed and salaried officers, the Consiliarii Augusti.

 <p> The Roman emperors, following an ancient practice of Roman magistrates, consulted their friends and followers (<seg lang="la">amici, familiares, comites</seg>) before giving judicial decisions in cases of importance. The <seg lang="la">consilium principis</seg>, or judicial council thus instituted, became a standing body in the time of Hadrian ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart.

 <p>The term <seg lang="la">auditorium principis</seg> is used as equivalent to <seg lang="la">consilium.</seg> It was not a general council for State affairs, and is not to be confused with the political council we find certain emperors convening. Its functions were generally confined to legal business. The emperor not only took its advice respecting his judgments, but also in all matters connected with legal administration. It was strictly consultative in character, the emperor not being bound in any way by its opinion. Changes were made in its constitution by Diocletian and his successors. The ordinary members of the reconstituted body, which is known as the <seg lang="la">consistorium principis</seg>, were called <seg lang="la">comites consistoriani;</seg> they were divided into the two classes of (1) <seg lang="la">illustres</seg>,</p>

<head orig="Constantīnus">Constantinus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps"> Flavius Valerius Aurelius Claudius</hi>, known as The Great, son of the emperor Constantius Chlorus and <ref type="cross" target="crosshelena">Helena</ref> (q.v.), was born A.D. 272, at Naïsus, a city of Dacia Mediterranea. When Constantine's father was associated in the government by Diocletian, the son was retained at court as a kind of hostage, but was treated with great kindness at first, and was allowed several opportunities of distinguishing himself. After the abdication of Diocletian, Constantius and Galerius were elevated to the rank of Augusti, while two new Caesars, Severus and Maximin, were appointed to second them. Constantine was not called to the succession. Diocletian, partial to Galerius, his son-in-law, had left the nomination of the two new Caesars to the latter; and the son of Constantius, whose popularity and talents had excited the jealousy of Galerius, and whose departure, although earnestly solicited by his father, was delayed from time to time under the most frivolous pretences, with difficulty at length obtained permission to join his parent in the West, and only escaped the machinations of the emperor by travelling with his utmost speed until he reached the western coast of Gaul. He came just in time to join the Roman legions, which were about to sail under his father's command to Britain, in order to make war upon the Caledonians. Having subdued the northern barbarians, Constantius returned to York (Eboracum), where he died in the month of July, in the year 306. Galerius, <cb /> sure of the support of his two creatures, the Caesars, had waited impatiently for the death of his colleague, to unite the whole Roman Empire under his individual sway. But the moderation and justice of Constantius had rendered him the more dear to his soldiers from the contrast of these qualities with the ferocity of his rival. At the moment of his death, the legions stationed at York, as a tribute of gratitude and affection to his memory, and, according to some, at his dying request, saluted his son Constantine with the title of Caesar and decorated him with the purple. Whatever resentment Galerius felt at this, he soon perceived the danger of engaging in a civil war. As the eldest of the emperors, and the representative of Diocletian, he recognized the authority of the colleague imposed upon him by the legions. He assigned to him the administration of Gaul and Britain, but gave him only the fourth rank among the rulers of the Empire with the title of Caesar.</p>
 <p>Under this official appellation Constantine administered the prefecture of Gaul for six years (A.D. 306-312), perhaps the most glorious, and certainly the most virtuous, period of his life. The title and rank of Augustus, which his soldiers had conferred upon Constantine, but which Galerius had not allowed him to retain, the latter gave to Severus, one of his own Caesars. This dignity had been expected by Maxentius, son of the abdicated emperor Maximian, the former colleague of Diocletian. Indignant at his disappointment, Maxentius caused himself to be proclaimed emperor by his army; and, to strengthen his usurpation, he induced his father to leave his retreat and resume the imperial title. A scene of contention followed, scarcely paralleled in the annals of Rome. Severus marched against the two usurpers; but was abandoned by his own troops, surrendered, and was slain. Galerius levied a great army, and marched into Italy against Maximian and Maxentius, who, dreading his power, retired to Gaul and endeavoured to procure the support of Constantine. This politic chief did not consider it expedient to provoke a war at that time and for no better cause; and, Galerius having withdrawn from Italy and returned to the East, Maximian and Maxentius returned to Rome. To aid him in the struggle, Galerius conferred the title of emperor on his friend Licinius; and thus there were at once six pretenders to the sovereignty of the Empire—namely, Galerius and Licinius; Maximian and his son Maxentius; Maximin, who had been nominated Caesar by Galerius; and Constantine, the son and successor of Constantius. Among these rivals Constantine possessed a decided superiority in prudence and abilities, both military and political. The harsh temper of Maximian soon led to a quarrel between him and his son Maxentius. Leaving Rome, he went to Gaul, to Constantine, who had become his son-in-law when he and his son were endeavouring to make head against Galerius. Here also Maximian found himself disappointed of that power which he so greatly longed to possess; and having plotted against Constantine, was detected and put to death. Galerius died not long after (311), leaving his power to be divided between his Caesars, Maximin and Licinius; so that there were now four competitors for the Empire: Constantine, Maxentius, Maximin, and Licinius. Maxentius speedily provoked open 
<pb n="404" /><cb />
 hostilities with Constantine, who marched at the head of a powerful army towards Rome.</p>
 <p>It was while Constantine was proceeding on this momentous expedition that he made an open and public declaration in favour of Christianity. Before that time, the persecuting edicts of Diocletian had been much mitigated by the forbearance and leniency of Constantius; and Constantine not only followed his father's example in being merciful to the persecuted Christians, but even showed them some marks of positive favour. Very considerable numbers of them, in consequence, flocked to his standard and swelled the ranks of his army. <figure id="fig.00404">
<head orig="Constantine and Fausta.">Constantine and Fausta.</head>
</figure> Their peaceful, orderly, and faithful conduct, contrasting most favourably with the turbulent and dissolute behaviour of those who formed the mass of common armies, won his entire confidence. To what extent this led Constantine to form a favourable opinion of Christianity, or inclined him to view with esteem and respect the tenets which had produced such results, cannot be ascertained. How far, also, his avowed reception of Christianity was influenced by the prudence of the politician, how far by the conviction of the convert, it is impossible to determine. The accounts of his dream and his vision (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslabarum">Labarum</ref>), which united to enforce his trust in Christianity, bear too much the aspect of fiction, or of having been the illusive consequences of mental anxiety, brooding intensely on the possible results of a great religious revolution, to be woven into the narrative of sober history. The story goes, however, that on his march to Rome, either at Autun in Gaul, or near the Rhine, or at Verona in Italy, Constantine beheld in the sky a brilliant cross with the inscription <foreign lang="greek">Ἐν τούτῳ νίκα</foreign>, “By this conquer!” and that on the night before his decisive battle with Maxentius a vision appeared to him in his sleep, bidding him inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the sacred monogram of the name of Christ. This, at least, is certain, that Constantine caused the Cross to be employed as the imperial standard, and advanced with it to promised victory. After the armies of Maxentius, led by his generals, had sustained two successive defeats, that emperor himself, awakening from his sensual and inactive life at Rome, advanced against his formidable assailant, and met him near the little river Cremera, about nine miles from the city. Maxentius lost the day, after a bloody conflict, and, in endeavouring to enter <cb /> the city by the Milvian bridge, was precipitated into the Tiber, where he perished (October 27th, 312).</p>
 <p>Constantine was received at Rome with acclamations; Africa acknowledged him, as well as Italy; and an edict of religious toleration, issued at Milan, extended the advantages, hitherto enjoyed by Gaul alone, to this prefecture also. After a brief stay at Rome, during which he restored to the Senate their authority, disbanded the Praetorian Guard, and destroyed their fortified camp, from which they had so long awed the city and given rulers to the Empire, Constantine proceeded to Illyricum to meet Licinius, with whom he had formed a secret league before marching against Maxentius. The two emperors met at Milan, where their alliance was ratified by the marriage of Licinius to Constantine's sister. During this calm interview, Constantine prevailed upon Licinius to repeal the persecuting edicts of Diocletian, and to issue a new one, by which Christianity was encouraged, its teachers were honoured, and its adherents advanced to places of trust and influence in the State. After the overthrow of Maximin by Licinius, and his death at Nicomedia, Constantine and his brother-in-law were now the only two that remained of the six competitors for the Empire; and the peace between them, which had seemed to be established on so firm a basis, was soon interrupted by a strife for sole supremacy. In the first war (A.D. 315) Constantine wrested Illyricum from his competitor. After an interval of eight years the contest was renewed. Licinius was beaten before Adrianople, the 3d of July, 323, and Constantine the Great was recognized as sole master of the Roman world.</p>
 <p>The seat of empire was now transferred to <ref type="cross" target="crossbyzantium">Byzantium</ref> (q.v.), which took from him the name of Constantinople. Several edicts were issued for the suppression of idolatry; and the churches and property restored to the Christians, of which they had been deprived during the last persecution. A reconstruction of the Empire was effected upon a plan entirely new, and this renovated Empire was pervaded by the worship and the institutions of Christianity. That much of the policy of the statesman was mixed up with this patronage of the new religion can easily be imagined. But still, it would be wrong to make him, as some have done, a mere hypocrite and dissembler. The state of his religious knowledge, so far as we have any means of judging, was certainly very inadequate and imperfect; but he was well aware of the characters of the two conflicting religions, Christianity and Paganism, and the purity of the former could not but have made some impression upon his mind.</p>
 <p>The private character of Constantine has suffered, in the eyes of posterity, from his stern treatment of Crispus, his son by his first wife, whom he had made the partner of his Empire and the commander of his armies. Crispus was at the head of the administration in Gaul, where he gained the hearts of the people. In the wars against Licinius he had displayed singular talents, and had secured victory to the arms of his father. But from that moment a strong and unnatural jealousy stifled every paternal feeling in the bosom of the monarch. He detained Crispus in his palace, surrounded him with spies and 
<pb n="405" /><cb />
 informers, and at length, in the month of July, 324, ordered him to be arrested in the midst of a grand festival, to be carried off to Pola in Istria, and there put to death. A cousin of Crispus, the son of Licinius and Constantine's sister, was at the same time sent, without trial, without even an accusation, to the block. His mother implored in vain, and died of grief. It is fair, however, to say that Niebuhr found evidence to support the view that Crispus aimed at supplanting his father. Fausta, the daughter of Maximian, the wife of Constantine, and the mother of the three princes who succeeded him, was shortly after stifled in the bath by order of her husband for infidelity.</p>
 <p>In the following year the celebrated Council of Nicaea was held, at which he opposed the Arians, probably on political grounds only, as being the weaker party; for just before his death he received baptism from an Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia.</p>
 <p>Constantine died at the age of sixty-three, at Nicomedia, July 22d, 337, after a reign of thirtyone years from the death of his father, and of fourteen from the conquest of the Empire. He left three sons, Constantine, Constans, and Constantius, among whom he divided his Empire. The first, who had Gaul, Spain, and Britain for his portion, was conquered by the armies of his brother Constans, and killed in the twenty-fifth year of his age, A.D. 340. Magnentius, the governor of the provinces of Rhaetia, murdered Constans in his bed, after a reign of thirteen years; and Constantius, the only surviving brother, now become the sole emperor, A.D. 353, punished his brother's murderer, and gave way to cruelty and oppression. He visited Rome, where he enjoyed a triumph, and died (361) in his march against Julian , who had been proclaimed emperor by his soldiers at Paris.</p>

 <p> Enactments of the Roman emperors, in the exercise of their legislative authority, which had statutory force. They comprise the following varieties:</p>
 <p>(1) <title>Orationes</title>, by which, in the earlier imperial period, the emperor submitted a “bill” to the Senate ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 7</bibl>).

 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>Edicta</title> or <seg lang="la">edictales constitutiones</seg>, general rules of law made by the emperor after the analogy of the edicts of the republican magistrates.

 </p>
 <p>(4) <title>Decreta</title> and <seg lang="la">rescripta</seg>, issued by the emperor in his capacity as praetor, judge, or supreme jurisconsult. Up to the time of Constantine they were by far the commonest kind of constitutio. <title>Decreta</title> were determinations of suits by the emperor either as sitting in a court of first instance or on appeal ( <bibl n="Suet.

<div2 id="crossconsularis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Consulāris">Consularis</head>

 <p> A term which, throughout the time of the Roman Republic, signifies a person who has been invested with the consulship; but under the Empire a mere title for the higher class of officers, who thereby obtained permission to have the insignia of a consul, without ever having actually been consuls. Hence the title was almost equivalent to that of an “honorary consul” (<seg lang="la">consul honorarius;</seg> Cod. Theod. vi. tit. 19, s. 1). The title was given especially to generals, as formerly persons after their consulship had usually undertaken the command of an army in the provinces. <title>Consularis</title> gradually became the established name for those intrusted with the administration of imperial provinces. During the second century A.D., the title <seg lang="la">consularis</seg> always denotes a governor who had actually held the office of consul or had received the title from the emperor; but by the fourth century it had become a mere title of a particular class of 
<pb n="406" /><cb />
 provincial governors. The emperor Hadrian divided Italy into four districts, and over each he placed an officer who likewise bore the title of <seg lang="la">consularis.</seg> At Constantinople the title was given to the superintendents of the aqueducts (<seg lang="la">consulares aquarum</seg>), who seem to have been analogous to the <seg lang="la">curatores aquarum</seg> of Rome.

<div2 id="crossconsules" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Consŭles">Consules</head>

 <p> (originally <hi rend="SmallCaps">Praetōres</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ὕπατοι</foreign>). The Roman magistrates to whom the supreme authority was transferred from the kings, after the expulsion of the latter in B.C. 510. The consuls gave their name to the year. They were elected by the Comitia Centuriata, and down to B.C. 366 from the patricians only. The legal age at which a man might be elected was, in the time of Cicero, fortythree. The time of entering on the office varied in the early periods: in B.C. 222, it was fixed to March 15th; in 153, to the 1st of January. The accession of the new consuls was attended with the performance of certain ceremonies, among which may be mentioned a procession of the consuls to the Capitol, with the Senate, <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, and other citizens of position, as escort; an offering of white bulls to Iupiter, and the utterance of solemn vows.</p>
 <p>The consuls were the representatives of the royal authority, and consequently all other magistrates were bound to obey them, with the exception of the tribunes of the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> and the dictator. During a dictatorship their powers fell into abeyance. In the city their authority was limited by the right of appeal to the people and the veto of the tribunes. But in the army, and over their subordinates, they had full power of life and death. Some of their original functions passed from them in course of time. Thus in B.C. 444, the business of the census was made over to the censors; in 366, the civil jurisdiction within the city, so far as it included the right of performing the acts of adoption, emancipation, and liberation of slaves, was transferred to the praetors. In the field, however, having the criminal jurisdiction in their hands, they had also the right of deciding in civil cases affecting the soldiers. In the general administration of public business the consuls, although formally recognized as the supreme authority, gradually became, in practice, dependent upon the Senate and the Comitia, as they had only the power of preparing the resolutions proposed and carrying them out if accepted. Within the city their powers were virtually confined to summoning the Senate and the Comitia and presiding over their meetings. They also nominated the dictators, and conducted the elections and legislation in the Comitia and the levies of soldiers. After the office of dictator fell into abeyance, the power of the consuls was, in cases of great danger, increased to dictatorial authority by a special decree of the Senate. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.</p>
 <p>An essential characteristic of the consular office was that it was collegial, and therefore if one consul died another (called <seg lang="la">consul suffectus</seg>) was immediately elected. This <seg lang="la">consul suffectus</seg> had absolutely the same authority as his colleague, but he had to lay down his office with him at the end of the year for which the two had been originally elected.</p>
 <p>The power of the two consuls being equal, the business was divided between them. In the administration of the city they changed duties every month, the senior taking the initiative. With regard to their insignia—namely, the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, <cb /> <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, and twelve lictors—the original arrangement was that the lictors walked in front of the officiating consul, while the other was only attended by an <seg lang="la">accensus.</seg> In later times the custom was for the lictors to walk before the officiating consul and behind the other.</p>
 <p>In the field each consul commanded two legions with their allied troops; if they were in the same locality, the command changed from day to day. The question of the administration of the provinces they either settled by consent, or left it to be decided by lot. With the extension of the Empire the consuls became unable to undertake the whole burden of warfare, and the praetors were called in to assist. The provinces were then divided into consular and praetorian; the business of assignment being left to the Senate, which, after the year 122, was bound to make it before the elections. In the first century B.C., a law of Sulla deprived the consuls of an essential element of their authority, the military <seg lang="la">imperium;</seg> for it enacted that the consuls should spend their year of office in Rome, and only repair to the provinces and assume the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> after its conclusion.</p>
 <p>In the Civil Wars the consular office completely lost its old position, and though it continued to exist under the Empire, it became, practically, no more than an empty title. The emperors, who often held the office themselves, like Caesar, for several years in succession, had the right of nominating the candidates, and therefore, in practice, had the election in their own hands. It became usual to nominate several pairs of consuls for one year, so as to confer the distinction on as many persons as possible. In such cases, the consuls who came in on January 1, after whom the year was named, were called <seg lang="la">consules ordinarii</seg>, the <seg lang="la">consules suffecti</seg> counting as <seg lang="la">minores.</seg> Until the middle of the first century A.D., it was a special distinction to hold the consulship for a whole year; but after that no cases of this tenure occur. In time the insignia (<seg lang="la">ornamenta consularia</seg>), or honorary distinctions of the office, were given, in certain degrees, even to men who had not been consuls at all. The chief duties of the consuls now were to preside in the Senate and to conduct the criminal trials in which it had to give judgment. But, besides this, certain functions of civil jurisdiction were in their hands, notably the liberation of slaves, the provision for the costly games which occurred during their term of office, the festal celebrations in honour of the emperor, and the like. After the seat of empire was transferred to Constantinople, the consulate was, towards the end of the fourth century, divided between the two capital cities. The consulate of the Western capital came to an end in A.D. 534, that of the Eastern in 541. From that time the emperor of the East bore the title of <seg lang="la">consul perpetuus.</seg>

 <p> A Roman deity, the god of counsel, as his name denotes. His altar was in the Circus Maximus, and was always covered, except on his festival-day, the 18th of August, called Consualia.

Hence Consus has probably been confounded with Neptunus Equestris. It was at the Consualia that the Sabine maidens were carried off by the Romans.

<div2 id="crosscontorniati" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Contorniāti">Contorniati</head>

 <p> This Italian word (French and English <foreign lang="fr">contorniates</foreign>) has been usually employed by numismatists to denote a particular class of circular metallic objects bearing various devices and legends, which were issued, though not for circulation as currency, under the Roman Empire. The ancient appellation of these objects is not known; their modern name has been derived from the circle (in Italian <foreign lang="it">contorno</foreign>) which marks both of their sides, in incuse. The metal of which contorniates are composed is copper, with a certain amount of alloy; in size they are, as a rule, somewhat larger than the “first brass” coins (<seg lang="la">sestertii</seg>) of the early Empire, but they are much thinner and are characterized by the circular depression already referred to. The greater number of them present on both sides a device in relief, which is generally obtained, not by striking from a die (as in the case of the medallions), but by process of casting from a mould.</p>
 <p>The first issue of the contorniates, which are all of Western origin, is assigned by Eckhel to the time of Constantine (A.D. 306-337), and this date has been practically accepted by the most recent authorities on the subject. Their fabrication, according to Sabatier, ceased under Anthemius (A.D. 464-472).<cb /></p>
 <p>The types or devices of the contorniates, though offering considerable varieties, may be considered to have reference to the public games and spectacles in the Circus, the Odeum, the Stadium, and the Amphitheatre. The legends are nearly always descriptive of the types.

In the time of Alexander the Great an enormous tunnel was cut through the rock for the discharge of the water. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossemissarium">Emissarium</ref>.) This proved effective until it fell into ruins, when the district again became unwholesome and marshy. In 1886, however, it was once more properly drained by a French company.

<head orig="Corcȳra">Corcyra</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κέρκυρα</foreign>, later <foreign lang="greek">Κόρκυρα</foreign>). An island in the Ionian Sea, off the coast of Epirus, in which Homer is thought to have placed the fabled gardens of Alcinoüs. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossscheria">Scheria</ref>.) It is said to have been first known under the name of Drepané, perhaps from its similarity of shape to a scythe. To this name succeeded that of Scheria, always used by Homer, and by which it was possibly known in his time. From the <title>Odyssey</title> we learn that this island was then inhabited by Phaeacians, a people who, even at that early period, had acquired considerable skill in nautical affairs and possessed extensive commercial relations, since they traded with the Phoenicians, and also with Euboea and other countries (<title>Odyss.</title> vi. vii.).</p>
 <p>Corcyra was in after-days the principal city of the island, and was situated precisely where the modern town of Corfu stands. Scylax speaks of 
<pb n="410" /><cb />
 three harbours, one of which is depicted as beautiful. In the Middle Ages, the citadel obtained the name of <foreign lang="greek">Κορυφώ</foreign>, from its two conical hills or crests, which appellation was, in process of time, applied to the whole town and finally to the island itself. Hence the modern name of Corfu, which is but a corruption of the former. The following is a sketch of the history of this island. Its earlier periods are enveloped in the mist of uncertainty and conjecture. A colony of Colchians is said to have settled there about 1349 years before our era. In process of time, Corcyra, enriched and aggrandized by its maritime superiority, became one of the most powerful nations in Greece ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 1</bibl>). The Corinthians, under Chersicrates, formed a settlement here in B.C. 753, and 415 years afterwards it was captured by Agathocles of Syracuse, who gave it to his daughter Lanessa upon her marriage with Pyrrhus of Epirus. It was occupied by the troops of the Illyrian queen Teuta, about fifty-eight years after its seizure by Agathocles, but was soon after taken from her by the Romans, under the consul Cn. Flavius; and, although it had the privileges of a free city, it remained under the Romans for many centuries. In the time of Strabo it was reduced to extreme misery.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κόρδαξ</foreign>). An extremely indecent dance peculiar to the comic chorus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscomoedia">Comoedia</ref>.) The gestures, and, indeed, the costumes, of the choreutae were such that even the Athenians considered it justifiable only at the festival of Dionysus, when every one was allowed to be drunk in honour of the god; for if an Athenian citizen danced the cordax sober and unmasked, he was looked upon as the most shameless of men and forfeited altogether his character for respectability (Theophr. <title>Charact.</title> 6). Aristophanes himself, who did not much scruple at violating common decency, claims some merit for his omission of the cordax in the <title>Clouds</title>, and for the more modest attire of his chorus in that play. According to Athenaeus, the cordax was a sort of <foreign lang="greek">ὑπόρχημα</foreign>, or imitative dance, in which the choreutae expressed the words of the song by comic gesticulations. Such a dance was the hyporcheme of the Spartan <foreign lang="greek">δεικελίκται</foreign>—buffoons, whose peculiar mimic gestures seem to have formed the basis of the Dorian comedy, which prevailed in Megaris, and which probably was the parent stock, not only of the Attic, but also of the Sicilian and Italian comedy.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κόριννα</foreign>). A poetess of Thebes (fl. B.C. 490), or, according to others, of Tanagra, distinguished for her skill in lyric verse, and remarkable for her personal attractions. She was the rival of Pindar, while the latter was still a young man; and, according to Aelian, she gained the victory over him no less than five times. Pausanias, in his travels, saw at Tanagra a picture, in which Corinna was represented as binding her head with a fillet of victory, which she had gained in a contest with Pindar. He supposes that she was less indebted for this victory to the excellence of her poetry than to her Boeotian dialect, which was more familiar to the ears of the judges at the games, and also to her extraordinary beauty. Corinna afterwards assisted the young poet with her advice. It is related of her that she recommended him to ornament his poems with mythical narrations; but that when he had composed a hymn, in the first six verses of which (still extant) almost the whole of the Theban mythology was introduced, she smiled and said, “We should sow with the hand, not with the whole sack” (Pausan. ix. 22; <title>De Glor. Ath.</title>). She was surnamed “the Fly” (<foreign lang="greek">Μυῖα</foreign>), as Erinna had been styled “the Bee.” The poems of Corinna were all in the Boeotian or Aeolic dialect. Too little of her poetry, however, has been preserved to allow of our forming a safe judgment of her style of composition. The extant fragments refer mostly to mythological subjects, particularly to heroines of the Boeotian legends. These remains are given by Bergk in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Poetae Lyrici Graeci</title> (4th ed. 1878)</bibl>.

<head orig="Corinthiăcus Isthmus">Corinthiacus Isthmus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰσθμὸς Κορίνθου</foreign>). An isthmus between the Saronicus Sinus and Corinthiacus Sinus, and uniting the Peloponnesus to the northern parts of Greece. Its breadth, in the narrowest part, was less than six miles (or not quite five miles). It has lately <bibl default="NO">(1893)</bibl> been cut by a canal. Ships were drawn, by means of machinery, from one sea to the other, near the town of Schoenus, over the narrowest part of the isthmus, which was called <foreign lang="greek">Δίολκος</foreign>. This could only be accomplished, however, with the vessels usually employed in commerce, or with 
<pb n="411" /><cb /> <foreign lang="greek">λέμβοι</foreign>, which were light ships of war, chiefly used by the Illyrians and Macedonians. The tediousness and expense attending this process, and still more probably the difficulty of circumnavigating the Peloponnesus, led to frequent attempts, at various periods, for effecting a junction between the two seas; but all proved equally unsuccessful. Demetrius Poliorcetes abandoned the enterprise, because it was found that the two gulfs were not on the same level. We read of the attempt having been made before his time by Periander and Alexander, and, subsequently to Demetrius, by Iulius Caesar, Caligula, Nero, and Herodes Atticus. Dio Cassius tells nearly the same story about digging through the isthmus as that which is related to travellers at this day. He says that blood issued from the ground; that groans and lamentations were heard, and terrible apparitions seen. In order to stimulate the perseverance of the people, Nero took a spade and dug himself (Dio Cass. lxiii. 16; and cf.  <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 19" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>19</bibl>). Lucian informs us, that Nero was said to have been deterred from proceeding, by a representation made to him, similar to that which Demetrius received respecting the unequal levels of the two seas ( <title>De Cleom.</title>). The Isthmus of Corinth derived great celebrity from the games which were celebrated there every five years in honour of Palaemon or Melicerta, and subsequently of Poseidon (Pausan. i. 44). These continued in vogue when the other gymnastic exercises of Greece had fallen into neglect and disuse; and it was during their solemnization that the independence of Greece was proclaimed, after the victory of Cynoscephalae, by order of the Roman Senate and people (Polyb. xviii. 29; <bibl n="Liv.  33. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxiii. 32</bibl>). After the destruction of Corinth, the superintendence of the Isthmian Games was committed to the Sicyonians by the Romans; on its restoration, however, by Iulius Caesar, the presidency of the games again reverted to the Corinthian settlers (Pausan. ii. 2).

<head orig="Corinthus">Corinthus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κόρινθος</foreign>). A famous city of Greece, situated on the isthmus of the same name. Commanding by its position the Ionian and the Aegean seas, and holding, as it were, the keys of the Peloponnesus, Corinth, from the pre-eminent advantages of its situation, was already the seat of opulence and the arts, while the rest of Greece was sunk in comparative obscurity <cb /> and barbarism. Its origin is, of course, obscure; but we are assured that it already existed under the name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἐφύρη</foreign> before the siege of Troy. According to the assertions of the Corinthians themselves, their city received its name from Corinthus, the son of Zeus; but Pausanias does not credit this popular tradition, and cites the poet Eumelus to show that the appellation was really derived from Corinthus, the son of Marathon (ii. 1). Homer certainly employs both names indiscriminately ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 570" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 570</bibl>; xiii. 663). Pausanias reports that the descendants of Sisyphus reigned at Corinth until the invasion of their territory by the Dorians and the Heraclidae, when Doridas and Hyanthidas, the last princes of this race, abdicated the crown in favour of Aletes, a descendant of Heracles, whose lineal successors remained in possession of the throne of Corinth during five generations, when the crown passed into the family of the Bacchiadae, so named from Bacchis, the son of Prumnis, who retained it for five other generations. After this the sovereign power was transferred to annual magistrates, still chosen, however, from the line of the Bacchiadae, with the title of <foreign lang="greek">πρυτάνεις</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The oligarchy so long established by this rich and powerful family was at length overthrown, about B.C. 629, by Cypselus, who banished many of the Corinthians, depriving others of their possessions, and putting others to death ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 92</bibl>). Among those who fled from his persecution was Demaratus, of the family of the Bacchiadae, who settled at Tarquinii in Etruria, and whose descendants became sovereigns of Rome. The reign of Cypselus was prosperous, and the system of colonization, which had previously succeeded so well in the settlements of Corcyra and Syracuse, was actively pursued by that prince, who added Ambracia, Anactorium, and Leucas to the maritime dependencies of the Corinthians. <figure id="fig.00411">
<head orig="Corinth and its Ports.">Corinth and its Ports.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Cypselus was succeeded by his son Periander. On the death of this latter (B.C. 585), after a reign of forty-four years, according to Aristotle, his nephew Psammetichus came to the throne, but lived only 
<pb n="412" /><cb />
 three years. At his decease Corinth regained its independence, when a moderate aristocracy was established, under which the Republic enjoyed a state of tranquillity and prosperity unequalled by any other city of Greece. We are told by Thucydides that the Corinthians were the first to build war-galleys or triremes; and the earliest naval engagement, according to the same historian, was fought by their fleet and that of the Corcyreans, who had been alienated from their mother-State by the cruelty and impolicy of Periander. The city is believed to have had at this time a population of 300,000 souls. <figure id="fig.00412">

 <p>The arts of painting and sculpture, more especially that of casting in bronze, attained to the highest perfection at Corinth, and rendered this city the ornament of Greece, until it was stripped by the rapacity of a Roman general. Such was the beauty of its vases, that the tombs in which they had been deposited were ransacked by the Roman colonists whom Iulius Caesar had established there after the destruction of the city; and these, being transported to Rome, were purchased at enormous prices.

 <p>When the <ref type="cross" target="crossachaean-league">Achaean League</ref> (q.v.) became involved in a destructive war with the Romans, Corinth was the last hold of their tottering Republic; and had its citizens wisely submitted to the offers proposed by the victorious Metellus, it might have been preserved; but the deputation of that general having been treated with scorn and even insult, <figure id="fig.00412.2">
<head orig="Ancient Corinth. (Restoration.)">Ancient Corinth. (Restoration.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> the city became exposed to all the vengeance of the Romans (Polyb. xl. 4. 1). L. Mummius, the consul, appeared before its walls with a numerous army, and after defeating the Achaeans in a general engagement, entered the town, now left without defence and deserted by the greater part of the inhabitants. It was then given up to plunder and finally set on fire; the walls also were razed to the ground, so that scarcely a vestige of this once great and noble city remained (B.C. 146). Polybius, who saw its destruction, affirmed that he had seen the finest paintings strewed on the ground, and the Roman soldiers using them as boards for dice or draughts. Pausanias reports (vii. 16) that all the men were put to the sword, the women and children sold, and the most valuable statues and paintings removed to Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmummius">Mummius</ref>.) Strabo observes that the finest works of art which adorned that capital in his time had come from Corinth. He likewise states that Corinth remained for many years deserted and in ruins. Iulius Caesar, however, not long before his death, sent a numerous colony thither, by means of which Corinth was once more raised from its state of ruin, and renamed Colonia Iulia Corinthus. It was already a large and populous city and the capital of Achaia, when St. Paul preached the Gospel there for a year and six months (Acts, xviii. 11). It is also evident that when visited by Pausanias it was thickly adorned by public buildings and enriched with numerous works of art, and as late as the time of Hierocles we find it styled the metropolis of Greece. In a later age the Venetians received the place from a Greek emperor; Mohammed II. took it from them in 1458; the Venetians recovered it in 1699, and fortified the Acrocorinthus again; but the Turks took it anew in 1715, and retained it until driven from the Peloponnesus in 1822. In 1858, it was wholly destroyed by an earthquake, since which time it has been rebuilt upon a site three miles to the northeast.

 <p>An important feature of the scenery around Corinth was the Acrocorinthus, a mention of which has been made in a previous article. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacrocorinthus">Acrocorinthus</ref>.) On the summit of this hill was erected a temple of Aphrodité, to whom the whole of the Acrocorinthus, in fact, was sacred. In the times of Corinthian opulence and prosperity, it is said that the shrine of the goddess was attended by no less than one thousand female slaves, dedicated to her service as courtesans. These priestesses of Aphrodité contributed not a little to the wealth and luxury of the city, whence arose the well-known expression, <foreign lang="greek">οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθον ἐστ ὁ πλοῦς</foreign>, or, as Horace expresses it (<title>Epist.</title> i. 17, 36), “<title>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum</title>,” in allusion to its expensive pleasures.</p>
 <p>Corinth was famed for its three harbours—Lechaeum, on the Corinthian Gulf, and Cenchreae and Schoenus, on the Saronic. Near this last was the <foreign lang="greek">Δίολκος</foreign>, where vessels were transported over the isthmus by machinery. The city was the birthplace of the painters Ardices, Cleophantus, and Cleanthes; of the statesmen Periander, Phidon, Philolaüs, and Timoleon; and of Arion , who invented the dithyramb.</p>

<div2 id="crosscoriolanus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Coriolānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gaius Marcius</foreName>
 <p>A distinguished Roman of patrician rank, whose story forms a brilliant legend in the early history of Rome. His name at first was Gaius Marcius, but having contributed, mainly by his great personal valour, to the capture of Corioli, and the defeat of a Volscian army, assembled for its aid, on the same day, he received for this gallant exploit the surname of Coriolanus. Not long after this, however, during a scarcity at Rome, he opposed the distribution of a supply of provisions, in part sent by Gelon of Sicily, and advised the patricians to make this a means of recovering the power which had been wrested from them by the commons. For this and other conduct of a similar nature, he was tried in the Comitia Tributa and condemned to perpetual banishment. To gratify his vindictive spirit, Coriolanus presented himself as a suppliant to Tullius Aufidius, the leading man among the Volsci; was well received by him and the whole nation; and, war being declared, was invested, along with Aufidius, with the command of the Volscian forces. By his military skill and renown Coriolanus at once defeated and appalled the Romans, till, having taken almost all their subject-cities, he advanced at the head of the Volscian army against Rome itself and encamped only five miles from it, at the Fossae Cluiliae. All was terror and confusion in the Roman capital. Embassy after embassy was sent to Coriolanus, to entreat him to spare his country, but he remained inexorable, and would grant peace only on condition that the Romans restored all the cities and lands which they had taken from the Volsci and gave to the latter the freedom of Rome, as had been done in the case of the Latins. After all other means of conciliation had failed, a number of Roman matrons, headed by the mother (Veturia) and the wife (Volumnia) of Coriolanus, proceeded to his tent, where their lofty remonstrances were more powerful than the arms of <cb /> Rome had proved; and the son, after a brief struggle with his feelings, yielded to their request, exclaiming at the same time, “Oh, mother, thou hast saved Rome, but destroyed thy son!” The Volscian forces were then withdrawn, and Rome was thus saved, by feminine influence alone, from certain capture. On returning to the Volsci with his army, Coriolanus, according to one account, was summoned to trial for his conduct, and was slain in a tumult during the hearing of the cause, a faction having been excited against him by Tullius Aufidius, who was jealous of his renown (Dion. Hal. <title>Ant. Rom.</title> viii. 59). According to another statement, he lived to an advanced age among the Volscian people, often towards the close of his life exclaiming, “How miserable is the state of an old man in banishment!” ( <title>Coriol.;</title> <bibl n="Liv.  2. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ii. 33</bibl> foll.). Niebuhr, who writes the name Gnaeus Marcius , on what he considers good authority, indulges in some acute speculations on the legend of Coriolanus. He thinks that poetical invention has here most thoroughly stifled the historical tradition. He regards the name Coriolanus as of the same kind merely with such appellations as Camerinus, Collatinus, Mugillanus, Vibulanus, etc., which, when taken from an independent town, were assumed by its <foreign lang="greek">πρόξενος</foreign>, when from a dependent one, by its <seg lang="la">patronus.</seg> The capture of Corioli belongs merely, in his opinion, to an heroic poem. As for Coriolanus himself, he thinks that he merely attended the Volscian standard as leader of a band of Roman exiles. The story of Coriolanus has received a brilliant setting from the genius of Shakespeare.

<head orig="Cornelia">Cornelia</head>

 <p> (1) A daughter of Scipio Africanus Maior, and mother of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. Cornelia occupies a high rank for the purity and excellence of her private character, as well as for her masculine tone of mind. She was married to Sempronius Gracchus, and was left on his death with a family of twelve children, the care of whom devolved entirely upon herself. After the loss of her husband, her hand was sought by Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt, but the offer was declined. Plutarch speaks in high terms of her conduct during widowhood. Having lost all her children but three—one daughter, who was married to Scipio Africanus the younger, and two sons, Tiberius and Gains—she 
<pb n="414" /><cb />
 devoted her whole time to the education of these. Valerius Maximus relates an anecdote of Cornelia, which has often been cited. A Campanian lady, who was at the time on a visit to her, having displayed to Cornelia some very beautiful ornaments which she possessed, desired the latter, in return, to exhibit her own. The Roman mother purposely detained her in conversation until her children returned from school, when, pointing to them, she exclaimed, “These are my ornaments!” (<title>Haec ornamenta mea sunt</title>, Val. Max. 4 init.). Plutarch informs us that some persons blamed Cornelia for the rash conduct of her sons in after-life, she having been accustomed to reproach them that she was still called the mother-in-law of Scipio, not the mother of the Gracchi ( <title>T. Gracch.</title> 8). She bore the untimely death of her sons with great self-control, and a statue was afterwards erected in honour of her by the Roman people, bearing for an inscription the words “Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi” ( <title>C. Gracch.</title> 4).</p>
 <p>(2) Daughter of Metellus Scipio, married to Pompey after the death of her first husband, Publius Crassus. She was remarkable for the variety of her accomplishments and the excellence of her private character. Plutarch makes her to have been versed, not only in the musical art, but in polite literature, in geometry, and in the precepts of philosophy ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>55</bibl>). After the battle of Pharsalus, when Pompey joined her at Mitylené, Cornelia, with tears, ascribed all his misfortunes to her union with him, alluding at the same time to the unhappy end of her first husband, Crassus, in his expedition against the Parthians. (Cf. Lucan, viii. 88.) She was also a witness, from her galley, of the murder of her husband on the shores of Egypt ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 79" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>79</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) A daughter of Cinna. She was Iulius Caesar's second wife, and mother of Iulia, the wife of Pompey. She died young. Plutarch says it had been the custom at Rome for the aged women to have funeral panegyrics, but not the young. Caesar first broke through this custom by pronouncing one upon Cornelia ( <bibl n="Plut. Caes. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Caes.</title>5</bibl>).

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossquintus">Quintus</ref>, a contemporary of Cicero, distinguished for talents and literary acquirements, who attained to some of the highest offices in the State. Catullus and Ovid both speak of his poetic abilities, and he appears to have been the friend of both. Cornificius distinguished himself as propraetor in the Illyrian War, and also as governor of Syria and afterwards of Africa. In this latter province he espoused the cause of the Senate after Caesar's death, and received and gave protection to those who had been proscribed by <cb /> the Second Triumvirate. He lost his life, however, while contending in that country against Sextius, who had been sent against him by Octavianus. Some scholars make this Cornificius to have been the author of the rhetorical treatise to Herennius commonly ascribed to Cicero. (See Quint. iii. 1. 21.)

Like the <seg lang="la">tuba</seg>, it differed from the <seg lang="la">tibia</seg> in being a larger and more powerful instrument, and from the <seg lang="la">tuba</seg> itself in being curved nearly in the shape of a C, with a crosspiece to steady the instrument for the convenience of the performer. In Greek it is called <foreign lang="greek">στρογγύλη σάλπιγξ</foreign>. It had no stopples or plugs to adjust the scale to any particular mode; the entire series of notes was produced without keys or holes, by the modification of the breath and of the lips at the mouthpiece. Probably, from the description given of it in the poets, it was, like our own horn, an octave lower than the trumpet. The <seg lang="la">classicum</seg>, which originally meant a signal, rather than the musical instrument which gave the signal, was usually sounded with the cornu. <figure id="fig.00414">

 <p> or as one word, <hi rend="bold">Cornucopiae,</hi> later <hi rend="bold">Cornucopia</hi> (Ammian. Marcell. xxii. 9. 1; xxv. 2. 3). The horn of fruitfulness and abundance, used as the symbol of plenty. In mythology there are two different tales explaining the origin of this horn. One traces it to the horn of the goat Amalthea, which suckled Zeus. The horn was broken off and filled with fruits and flowers, and was afterwards placed by Zeus, together with the goat, among the stars. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamalthea">Amalthea</ref>.) Another legend relates 
<pb n="415" /><cb /> that it was the horn of the river-god <ref type="cross" target="crossachelous">Acheloüs</ref> (q.v.), which was wrenched off by Heracles, and which became forthwith a horn of plenty. Later mythologists combined the two tales, and tried to explain how the horn of Amalthea became the horn of Acheloüs ( <bibl n="Apollod.  2. 7. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.ii. 7. 5</bibl>). The origin of this symbol may perhaps be traced in the use of the horns of oxen or goats as drinking-cups; hence the <foreign lang="greek">ῥυτόν</foreign>, or drinking-horn, which is frequently confounded with the horn of abundance (Athen. xi. 468 d, 497 c).</p>

 <p>A Greek philosopher, born at Leptis in Africa, who lived and taught at Rome during the reign of Nero. The appellation L. Annaeus appears to indicate a client or freedman of the Seneca family. His tenets were those of the Stoic sect, and his name was not without distinction in that school of philosophy. He excelled in criticism and poetry; but his principal studies were of a philosophical character. His merit as a teacher of the Stoic doctrine sufficiently appears from his having been the preceptor of the satirist Persius. Persius, dying before his master, left him his library, with a considerable sum of money; but Cornutus accepted only the books, and gave the money to the sisters of his pupil. The poet Lucan was also one of his students. Under Nero, Cornutus was driven into exile (A.D. 68) for his freedom of speech. The emperor having written several books in verse on the affairs of Rome, and his flatterers advising him to continue the poem, the honest Stoic had the courage to remark that he doubted whether so large a work would be read; and when it was urged that Chrysippus had written as much, he replied, “His writings were useful to mankind.” After so unpardonable an offence against imperial vanity, the only wonder is that Cornutus escaped with his life. He composed some tragedies, and a large number of other works, the only one of which that has come down to us is the “Theory concerning the Nature of the Gods” (<foreign lang="greek">Θεωρία περὶ τῆς τῶν Θεῶν Φύσεως</foreign>); or, as it is entitled in one of the MSS., “Concerning Allegories” (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ἀλληγορίων</foreign>). Cornutus, in fact, in this production seeks to explain the Greek mythology on allegorical and physical principles. It has been edited by Lang <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1881)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">στέφανος</foreign>). A crown; that is, a circular ornament of metal, leaves, or flowers, worn by the ancients round the head or neck, and used as <cb /> a festive as well as funeral decoration, and as a reward of talent, military or naval prowess, and civic worth. It includes the synonyms, for which it is often used absolntely, <foreign lang="greek">στεφάνη, στέφος, στεφάνωμα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">corolla, sertum</seg>, “a garland or wreath.”</p>
 <p>The use of crowns on public and private occasions was so general in antiquity that there was a special literature on the subject, of which we have remains in Theophrastus (<title>Hist. Pl.</title> vi. 6), Athenaeus (lib. xv.), Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21.  1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxi. 1</bibl>-70<bibl n="Plin.

Mil.</title> 7, 10, 12).</p>
 <p>Crowns originally consisted of wool or the foliage of trees, especially myrtle-twigs or ivy, with which flowers of various kinds were subsequently interwoven. The makers and sellers of these garlands or crowns formed a distinct trade, and were called in Greece <foreign lang="greek">στεφανηπλόκοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">στεφανοποιοί</foreign>, and in Rome <seg lang="la">coronarii</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin.  21.  54" default="NO">Plin.xxi. 54</bibl><bibl n="Plin.  177" default="NO">Plin., 177</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The flowers used in making crowns were called in Greek <foreign lang="greek">στεφανώματα</foreign>, in Latin <seg lang="la">coronamenta.</seg></p>
 <p>The foliage and flowers were sometimes fastened together by the inner bark of the lindentree, such garlands being known as <seg lang="la">coronae sutiles</seg>, also <seg lang="la">nexae</seg> and <seg lang="la">sertae.</seg> At Athens, the flower-market was called <foreign lang="greek">αἱ μυρρίναι</foreign>, because myrtle (<foreign lang="greek">μύρτος</foreign>) was the material most commonly used in making them. Many of the flower-girls were celebrated in antiquity, especially Glycera the mistress of Pausias ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxi. 4</bibl>; xxxv. 125).</p>
 <p>At Rome, the temple of the Lares, at the head of the Via Sacra, was most frequented by the venders of garlands. The crowns among the Romans were often made of the leaves of plants, especially ivy, myrtle, and parsley. At Athens, the violet was very popular, but both the Greeks and Romans preferred the rose to any other flower, calling it “the king of flowers” and “the rose of the loves.” (See Achill. Tat. ii. 1; <bibl n="Anacr.  5." default="NO">Anacr.5.</bibl>) They were especially used for convivial crowns; and garlands of them were in request at Rome even in the winter, so that they were grown under glass ( <bibl n="Mart.  4. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 22</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 5</bibl>; xiii. 127), and were also imported from Egypt ( <bibl n="Mart.  6. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vi. 80</bibl>). As luxury increased, the leaves of the <seg lang="la">nardus</seg> or spikenard were brought from India for crowns ( <bibl n="Mart.  13. 51" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiii. 51</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxi. 11</bibl>). Garlands were also made of dried flowers, especially of amaranth, which, when moistened, had the appearance of fresh flowers, so that garlands of it were called <seg lang="la">coronae hibernae.</seg> The same name was given to crowns of artificial flowers ( <bibl n="Plin.  21.  5" default="NO">Plin.xxi. 5</bibl>). Sometimes they were made of a thin layer of metal covered with gold or silver, and called <seg lang="la">corollae</seg> or <seg lang="la">corollaria inaurata</seg> or <seg lang="la">inargentata.</seg></p>
 <p>The <title>corona Etrusca</title> was made of pure gold in the form of leaves, sometimes set with gems, and terminating in ribbons (<seg lang="la">lemnisci</seg>) of the same metal. It was held by a slave over the head of a general when he entered Rome in triumph ( <bibl n="Plin.  33.  11" default="NO">Plin.xxxiii. 11</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Crowns adorned with such pendent ribbons were called <seg lang="la">coronae lemniscatae</seg> ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg.

 <p>The <seg lang="la">corona civica</seg> was of oak leaves, and was awarded for saving a citizen's life in battle. <cb /> This secured for its possessor certain privileges, as freedom from taxes for himself, his father, and paternal grandfather.

<head orig="Corona Castrensis.">Corona Civica.</head>
</figure> regarded as a crown.</p>
 <p>The rayed crown, the <seg lang="la">insigne</seg> of the deified emperors, was not worn by the emperors of the first and second century A.D. Golden crowns were originally the free offerings of provincials and allies to victorious generals for the celebration of their triumphs. But from this custom there arose, <figure id="fig.00416.6">
<head orig="Corona Muralis.">Corona Muralis.</head>
</figure> even in republican times, the habit of compelling a contribution of money (<seg lang="la">aurum coronarium</seg>) to the governor of the province. During the imperial age this contribution was on exceptional occasions offered as a present to the emperors, but it was often also made compulsory.</p>
 <p>Among the Greeks, a crown (<foreign lang="greek">στέφανος</foreign>) was often an emblem of office. At Athens, for instance, a <figure id="fig.00416.7">
<head orig="Corona Navalis.">Corona Navalis.</head>
</figure> crown of bay was worn by the archons in office, the senators (<foreign lang="greek">βουλευταί</foreign>), and the orators while speaking. It was also the emblem of victory at the games, and a token of distinction for citizens of merit. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>.) Such crowns of honour were made originally of olive branches, but later of gold. The honour of a crown could be conferred by the people or the Senate, or by corporations 
<pb n="417" /><cb />
 and foreign States. The latter would often present a crown to the whole commonwealth. If the people or Senate presented the crown, the presentation took place in the great assembly or in the Senate-house, but not in the theatre except by special decree.

<head orig="Corsĭca">Corsica</head>

 <p> An island of the Mediterranean, called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">Κύρνος</foreign>. Its inhabitants were styled by the same people <foreign lang="greek">Κύρνιοι</foreign>; by the Romans, Corsi. In later times the island took also the name of Corsis (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Κορσίς</foreign>). The inhabitants were a rude race of mountaineers, indebted for their subsistence more to the produce of their flocks than to the cultivation of the soil. Seneca, who was banished to this quarter in the reign of Claudius, draws a very unfavourable picture of the island and its inhabitants; describing the former as rocky, unproductive, and unhealthy, and the latter as the worst of barbarians ( <title>De Consol. ad Helv.</title> c. 6, 8). His lines upon the character of the Corsicans are still remembered by them with resentment, and are as follows: <lb />Prima est ulcisci lex, altera vivere raptu, <lb />Tertia mentiri, quarta negare deos.</p>
 <p>The Corsi appear to have derived their origin from Ligurian and Iberian (called by Seneca Spanish) tribes. Eustathius says that a Ligurian woman, named Corsa, having pursued in a small boat a bull which had taken to the water, accidentally discovered the island, which her countrymen named after her. The Romans took the island from Carthage in B.C. 231, and subsequently two colonies were sent to it—one by Marius, which founded Mariana, and another by Sulla , which settled on the site of Aleria. Mantinorum Oppidum, in the same island, is now Bastia; and Urcinium, Ajaccio.

 <p>, a great classical philologist, was born at Bremen January 20th, 1820. From 1839 to 1843 he studied philology at Berlin, where he published <bibl default="NO">(1844)</bibl> <title>Origines Poesis Romanae.</title> He then taught for two years in Stettin, and in 1846 became an adjunct, and, later, full professor at Pforta. In 1866, he resigned the post and lived at Lichterfelde, near Berlin, devoting himself exclusively to his studies until his death in 1875. His chief works are: <title>Ueber Aussprache, Vokalismus, und Betonung der lateinischen Sprache</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1858-59; 2d ed. 1868-70)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Kritische Beiträge zur lateinischen Formenlehre</title> (Leipzig, 1863)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Kritische Nachträge zur lateinischen Formenlehre</title> (Leipzig, 1866)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Beiträge zur italischen Sprachkunde</title> (Leipzig, 1876)</bibl>; besides a number of treatises on old Italian dialects in Kuhn's <title>Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung;</title> the treatise <bibl default="NO"><title>De Volscorum Lingua</title> (Leipzig, 1858)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO"><title>Ueber die Sprache der Etrusker</title> (2 vols.

 <p>Dr. Corssen's great work is his <title>Aussprache</title>, than which no more memorable publication in the field of Latin scholarship has ever appeared. Its massing 
<pb n="418" /><cb /> of facts is a monument of scholarly research; while the acuteness of criticism, and the mastery of detail shown in the use to which the facts are put, rank Corssen with the greatest scholars of all time. Not equally successful was his attempt to solve the problems of Etruscan ethnology and language. So great was Dr. Corssen's authority on the dialects of Italy that when the first volume of his <title>Sprache der Etrusker</title> appeared, it was enthusiastically accepted as definitely clearing up the mystery that even Müller had failed to illuminate; and the author was hailed as “the Oedipus of the Etruscan Sphinx.” But the sober second judgment of scholars did not confirm this verdict, and the second volume (which appeared soon after Corssen's death) was read in a far different spirit. In fact, though the work is laboriously learned, and bears everywhere the marks of immense research, its theories fail to commend themselves, and the volumes are now only historically interesting.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κόραξ</foreign>). A sort of crane, used by Duilius (q. v.) against the Carthaginian fleet in the battle fought off Mylae in Sicily (B.C. 260). The Romans, we are told, being unused to the sea, saw that their only chance of victory was by bringing a seafight to resemble one on land. For this purpose they invented a machine, of which Polybius (i. 22) has left a minute description. In the fore part of the ship a round pole was fixed perpendicularly, twenty-four feet in height and about nine inches in diameter; at the top of this was a pivot, upon which a ladder was set, thirty-six feet in length <cb /> and four in breadth. The ladder was guarded by crossbeams, fastened to the upright pole by a ring of wood, which turned with the pivot above. Along the ladder a rope was passed, one end of which took hold of the <seg lang="la">corvus</seg> by means of a ring. The <seg lang="la">corvus</seg> itself was a strong piece of iron, with a spike at the end, which was raised or lowered by drawing in or letting out the rope. When an enemy's ship drew near, the machine was turned outward, by means of the pivot, in the direction of the assailant. Another part of the machine, which Polybius has not clearly described, is a breastwork, let down (as it would seem) from the ladder, and serving as a bridge on which to board the enemy's vessel. By means of these cranes, the Carthaginian ships were either broken or closely locked with the Roman, and Duilius gained a complete victory. See Polyb. i. 22.</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">corvus</seg> is also applied to various kinds of grappling-hooks, such as the <seg lang="la">corvus demolitor</seg>, mentioned by Vitruvius for pulling down walls, or the terrible engine spoken of by Tacitus, which, being fixed on the walls of a fortified place, and suddenly let down, carried off one of the besieging party, and then, by a turn of the machine, put him down within the walls. The word is used by Celsus for a scalpel. It is hardly necessary to remark that all these meanings have their origin in the supposed resemblance of the various instruments to the beak of a raven.

Without the walls was a celebrated temple of Aesculapius, enriched with many admirable works of art, and among others, two famous paintings of Apelles, the Antigonus and Aphrodité Anadyomené. The latter painting was so much admired that Augustus removed it to Rome and consecrated it to Iulius Caesar; and in consideration of the loss thus inflicted on the Coans, he is said to have remitted a tribute of one hundred talents which had been laid on them. Besides the great painter just mentioned, Cos could boast of ranking among her sons the first physician of antiquity, Hippocrates.

<div2 id="crosscottabus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cottăbus">Cottabus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κότταβος</foreign>). A Greek game very popular at drinking-bouts. The player lay on a couch, and in that position tried to throw a few drops of wine, in as high a curve as possible, at a mark, without spilling any of the wine. The mark was called <foreign lang="greek">κοτταβεῖον</foreign>, and was a bronze goblet or saucer (<foreign lang="greek">πλάστιγξ</foreign>) on the end of an upright rod (<foreign lang="greek">ῥάβδος</foreign>); and it was a point to make a noise when hitting it. On the <foreign lang="greek">κοτταβεῖον</foreign> was fastened a little image or a bust of Hermes, which was called <foreign lang="greek">μάνης</foreign>, and which the player had to hit first with the wine. The wine was supposed to make a sound (<foreign lang="greek">λάταξ</foreign>) both in hitting the figure and in falling afterwards into the saucer. This, of course, greatly increased the difficulty of the game. <figure id="fig.00421">
<head orig="Cottabus. (Vase from Corneto.)">Cottabus. (Vase from Corneto.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>There was another form of the game, in which the point was to make the wine hit the saucer while floating in a large vessel of water and sink it. The game was played in a chamber made for the purpose. The form of the room was circular, to give every player an equal chance of hitting the mark, which was placed in the centre. The victor generally received a prize agreed upon beforehand. The players also used the game to discover their chances of success in love. They uttered the name of their beloved while throwing the wine. A successful throw gave a good omen, an unsuccessful one a bad omen. A good player leaned upon his left elbow, remained quite quiet, and used only his right hand to throw with. The game came originally from Sicily, but became popular through the whole of Greece, and especially at Athens, where to play well was a mark of good <cb /> breeding. It did not go out of fashion until the fourth century after Christ.</p>
 <p>Vase-paintings representing the first form of the game exist in considerable numbers, one of them being reproduced in the preceding illustration.

Cottius thereupon made roads over the Alps, and erected (B.C. 8) at Segusio (Susa) a triumphal arch in honour of Augustus, extant at the present day. It is 44 feet in height and 39 in width, with projecting Corinthian columns at the corners and sacrificial scenes on the friezes.

Cicero says that he was remarkable, even at this early period, for his candour and his great love of justice. Crassus was but twenty-seven years old when his eloquence obtained the acquittal of his relation, the Vestal Licinia. Being elevated to the consulship in 95, he was the author of a law by which numbers of the allies, who passed for Roman citizens, were sent back to their respective cities. This law alienated from him the affections of the principal Italians, so that he was regarded by some as the primary cause of the Social War, which broke out three years after. Having Hither Gaul for his province, Crassus freed the country from the robbers that infested it, and for this service had the weakness to claim a triumph. The Senate were favourable to his application; but Scaevola, the other consul, opposed it, on the ground that he had not conquered foes worthy of the Roman people. Crassus conducted himself, in other respects, with great wisdom in his government, and not only did not remove from around him the son of Carbo , who had come as a spy on his conduct, but even placed him by his side on the tribunal, and did nothing of which the other was not a witness. Being appointed censor in 92, he caused the school of the Latin rhetoricians to be closed, regarding them as dangerous innovators for the young. Crassus left hardly any orations behind him, and he died while Cicero was yet in his boyhood; but still that author, having collected the opinions of those who had heard him, speaks with a minute and apparently perfect intelligence of his style of oratory. He was what may be called the most ornamental speaker that had hitherto appeared in the Forum. Though not without force, gravity, and dignity, these were happily blended with the most insinuating politeness, urbanity, ease, and gayety. He was master of the most pure and accurate language and of perfect elegance of expression, without any affectation or unpleasant appearance of previous study. Great clearness of language distinguished all his harangues; and, while descanting on topics of law or equity, he possessed an inexhaustible fund of argument and illustration. Some persons considered Crassus as only equal to Antonius, his great contemporary; others preferred him as the more perfect and accomplished orator. The most splendid of all the efforts of Crassus was the immediate cause of his death, which happened in B.C. 91, a short while before the commencement of the civil wars of Marius and Sulla , and a few days after the time in which he is supposed to have borne his part in the dialogue <title>De Oratore.</title> The consul Philippus had declared, in one of the assemblies of the people, that some other advice must be resorted to, since, with such a Senate as then existed, he could no longer direct the affairs of the government. A full Senate being immediately summoned, Crassus arraigued, in terms of the most glowing eloquence, the conduct of the consul, who, instead of acting as the political parent and guardian of the Senate, sought to deprive its members of their ancient inheritance of respect and dignity. Being further 
<pb n="423" /><cb />
 irritated by an attempt on the part of Philippus to force him into compliance with his designs, he exerted, on this occasion, the utmost effort of his genius and strength; but he returned home with a pleuritic fever, of which he died seven days after. This oration of Crassus, followed, as it was, by his almost immediate death, made a deep impression on his countrymen; who, long afterwards, were wont to repair to the Senate-house for the purpose of viewing the spot where he had last stood, and where he fell, as it may be said, in defence of the privileges of his order.</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, who was praetor B.C. 105. He was surnamed by his friends Agelastus (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀγέλαστος</foreign>), because, according to Pliny (vii. 19), he never laughed during the whole course of his life; or because, according to Lucilius, he laughed but once ( <title>De Fin.</title> v. 30).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Licinius</hi>, called the Rich (<title>Dives</title>), the son of the preceding, and the most opulent Roman of his day, was of a patrician family, and the son of a man of consular rank. His father and brother perished in the proscriptions of Marius and Cinna while he was still quite young, and, to avoid a similar fate, he took refuge in Spain until the death of Cinna , when he returned to Italy and served under Sulla. Crassus proved very serviceable to this commander in the decisive battle (B.C. 83) that was fought near Rome; but afterwards, making the most unjust and rapacious use of Sulla 's proscriptions, that leader, according to Plutarch, gave him up and never employed him again in any public affair. The glory which was then beginning to attend upon Pompey, though still young and only a simple member of the equestrian order, excited the jealousy of Crassus, and, despairing of rising to an equality with him in warlike operations, he betook himself to public affairs at home, and, by paying court to the people, defending the impeached, lending money, and aiding those who were candidates for office, he attained to an influence almost equal to that which Pompey had acquired by his military achievements. It was at the bar, in particular, that Crassus rendered himself extremely popular. He was not, it would seem, a very eloquent speaker, yet by care and application he eventually exceeded those whom nature had more highly favoured. When Pompey, or Caesar, or Cicero declined speaking in behalf of any individual, he often arose and advocated the cause of the accused. Besides this promptness to aid the unfortunate, his courteous and conciliating deportment acquired for him many friends, and made him very popular with the lower orders. There was not a Roman, however humble, whom he did not salute, or whose salutation he did not return by name.</p>
 <p>The great defect, however, in the character of Crassus was his inordinate fondness for wealth; and, although he could not strictly be called an avaricious man, since he is said to have lent money to his friends without demanding interest, yet he allowed the love of riches to exercise a paramount sway over his actions, and it proved at last the cause of his unhappy end. Plutarch informs us that his estate at first did not exceed three hundred talents, but that afterwards it amounted to the enormous sum of seven thousand one hundred talents (nearly $8,500,000). The means by which he attained to this are enumerated by the same writer, and some of them are singular enough. Observing, says Plutarch, how <cb /> liable the city was to fires, he made it his business to buy houses that were on fire and others that joined upon them; and he commonly got them at a low price, on account of the fear and distress of the owners about the result. A band of his slaves thereupon, regularly organized for the purpose, exerted themselves to extinguish the flames, and, after this was done, rebuilt what had been destroyed, and in this way Crassus gradually became the owner of a large portion of Rome. He gained large sums also by educating and then selling slaves. Plutarch, in fact, regards this as his principal source of revenue. With all this eager grasping after wealth, however, Crassus appears to have been no mean soldier, even though he displayed so few of the qualities of a commander in his Parthian campaign. Created praetor in B.C. 71, he was sent to terminate the war with Spartacus. He accordingly met, defeated him in several encounters, and at last, bringing him to a decisive action, ended the war by a single blow, Spartacus and forty thousand of his followers being left on the field. Not venturing to demand a triumph for a victory over gladiators and slaves, he contented himself with an ovation.</p>
 <p>In 70, Crassus obtained the consulship, having Pompey for his colleague. At a subsequent period we find him implicated by an informer in the conspiracy of Catiline, but acquitted by acclamation the moment the charge was heard by the Senate. We now come to the closing scene in the career of Crassus. When Caesar, on returning from his government to solicit the consulship, found Pompey and Crassus at variance (which had been the case also during almost all the time that they were colleagues in the consular office), and perceived that, for the furtherance of his own ambitious views, the aid of these two individuals would be needed by him for opposing the influence of the Senate, as well as that of Cicero, Cato , and Catulus, he managed to reconcile them, and soon, in conjunction with both of them, formed the well-known league usually styled the First Triumvirate (B.C. 60), which proved so fatal to the liberties of the Roman people. By the terms of this compact Crassus obtained the government of Syria. In the law that was passed relative to this government of Crassus, no mention was indeed made of any war in its neighbourhood; still every one knew that he had connected with it an immediate invasion of Parthia (B.C. 55). Plutarch even states that he had fixed upon neither Syria nor Parthia as the limits of his expected good fortune, but intended to penetrate even to Bactria, India, and the shores of the Eastern Ocean. The only motive to this memorable and unfortunate undertaking was the rapacious love of wealth.</p>
 <p>It was not, however, without considerable opposition from the people and the tribunes that Crassus was allowed to proceed on this expedition. All the influence of Pompey was necessary to prevent an expression of popular wrath, for no good was expected to result from hostilities against a people who had done the Romans no injury, and who were, in fact, their allies. When Crassus, moreover, had reached the gate of the city, the tribune Ateius attempted to stop him by force; but, failing in this, he immediately proceeded to perform a religious ceremony of the most appalling nature, by which he devoted the commander himself and all who should follow 
<pb n="424" /><cb />
 him on that service to the wrath of the infernal gods and a speedy destruction. Undismayed, however, by either denunciations or omens ( <bibl n="Cic.  Div. 2. 40" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Div.</title>ii. 40</bibl>), Crassus, embarking at Brundisium, proceeded into Asia by Macedonia and the Hellespont. As the enemy were not prepared for this unprovoked invasion, the Romans met with no resistance. At first Crassus overran the greater part of Mesopotamia; and, had he taken advantage of the consternation into which his sudden appearance had thrown the Parthians, he might, with the greatest ease, have extended his conquest to Babylonia itself. But, the season being far advanced, he did not think it expedient to proceed. On the contrary, having left in the different towns and strongholds a detachment of 7000 foot and 1000 horse, he returned into Syria and took up his winter quarters in that province. This retrograde movement was a fatal error. His occupations, too, during the winter were highly censurable, having more of the trader in them than the general. Instead of improving the discipline of the soldiers, and keeping them in proper exercise, he spent his time in making inquiry relative to the revenues of the cities, and in weighing the treasures which he found in the temple of Hierapolis. In the spring the Roman commander took the field, on the frontiers of Syria, with seven legions, four thousand horse, and an equal number of light or irregular troops. With this force he again passed the Euphrates, when he was joined by an Arabian chief, whom Plutarch calls Ariamnes, but who is elsewhere named Acbarus or Abgarus; and in this barbarian, owing to his knowledge of the country and his warm and frequent expressions of attachment to the Romans, Crassus unfortunately placed the utmost confidence. The result may easily be foreseen. Crassus intended to have followed the course of the Euphrates till he should reach the point where it approaches nearest to Seleucia and Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian Empire; but being dissuaded from this by his crafty guide, and directing his march across the plains, he was led at last into a sandy desert, where his army was attacked by the Parthian forces under Surenas. An unequal conflict ensued. The son of Crassus, sent with a detachment of Gallic horse to repel the Parthian cavalry, lost his life after the most heroic exertions; and his loss was first made known to his father by the barbarians carrying his head on a spear. Crassus himself, not long after, being compelled by his own troops to meet Surenas in a conference, was treacherously slain by the barbarians, and his head and right hand sent to the Parthian king, Orodes, who is said to have poured molten gold down the dead man's throat, saying, in allusion to his avarice, “Sate thyself now with that of which in life thou wert so greedy!” The whole loss of the Romans in this disastrous campaign was 20,000 killed and 10,000 taken prisoners.

<head orig="Crater">Crater</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κρατήρ</foreign>; Ionic <foreign lang="greek">κρητήρ</foreign>; Lat. <hi rend="italic">crater</hi> or <seg lang="la">cratera</seg>, from <foreign lang="greek">κεράννυμι</foreign>, “to mix”). A vessel in which the wine, according to the custom of the ancients, who very seldom drank it undiluted, was mixed with water, and from which the cups were filled. In the Homeric Age the mixture was always made in the dining-room by heralds or young men <cb /> (<foreign lang="greek">κοῦροι</foreign>). The use of the vessel is sufficiently clear from the expressions so frequent in the poems of Homer: <foreign lang="greek">κρητῆρα κεράσασθαι</foreign>—i. e. <foreign lang="greek">οἶνον καὶ ὕδωρ ἐν κρητῆρι μίσγειν</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">πίνειν κρητῆρα</foreign>, “to empty the crater”; <foreign lang="greek">κρητῆρα στήσασθαι</foreign> (<seg lang="la">cratera statuere</seg>), “to place the filled crater near the table”; <foreign lang="greek">κρητῆρας ἐπιστέφεσθαι ποτοῖο</foreign>, “to fill the craters to the brim.” The crater, in the Homeric Age, was generally of silver, sometimes with a gold edge, and sometimes all gold or gilt. It stood upon a tripod, and its ordinary place in the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> was in the most honourable part of the room, at the farthest end from the entrance, and near the seat of the most distinguished among the guests. The size of the crater seems to have varied according to the number of guests, for where their number is increased a larger crater is asked for. It would seem, at least at a later period (for in the Homeric poems we find no traces of the custom), that three craters were filled at every feast after the tables were removed. According to Suidas, the first was dedicated to Hermes, the second to Charisius, and the third to Zeus Soter; but others called them by different names; thus the first, or, according to others, the last, was also designated the <foreign lang="greek">κρατὴρ ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος</foreign>, “the crater of the good genius,” <foreign lang="greek">κρατὴρ ὑγιείας</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μετανιπτρίς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μετάνιπτρον</foreign>, because it was the crater from which the cups were filled after the washing of the hands. There were special craters named from places, e. g. Lesbian, Laconian, Argive ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 152" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 152</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Craters were among the first things on the embellishment of which the ancient artists exercised their skill. Homer mentions, among the prizes proposed by Achilles, a beautifully wrought silver crater, the work of the ingenious Sidonians, which, by the elegance of its workmanship, excelled all others on the whole earth. In the reign of Croesus, king of Lydia, the Lacedaemonians sent to that king a brazen crater, the border of which was all over ornamented with figures (<foreign lang="greek">ζώδια</foreign>), and which was of such an enormous size that it contained 300 amphorae. Croesus himself dedicated to the Delphic god two huge craters, which the Delphians believed to be the work of Theodorus of Samos, and Herodotus was induced, by the beauty of their workmanship, to think the same. It was <figure id="fig.00424.2"><head> Crater. (Dennis, <title>Etruria</title>, i. p. cxii.)</head></figure> about Ol. 35 that the Samians dedicated six talents (the tenth of the profits made by Colaeus on his voyage to Tartessus) to Heré, in the shape of an immense brazen crater, the border of which 
<pb n="425" /><cb />
 was adorned with projecting heads of griffins. This crater, which Herodotus calls Argive (from which we must infer that the Argive artists were celebrated for their craters), was supported by three colossal brazen statues, seven yards high, with their knees closed together.</p>
 <p>The number of craters dedicated in temples seems everywhere to have been very great. Livius Andronicus, in his <title>Equus Troianus</title>, represented Agamemnon returning from Troy with no less than 3000 craters, and Cicero says that Verres car<figure id="fig.00425">
<head orig="Bronze Crater from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Bronze Crater from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> ried away from Syracuse the most beautiful brazen craters, which most probably belonged to the various temples of that city. But craters were not only dedicated to the gods as <seg lang="la">anathemata</seg>, but were used on various solemn occasions in their service. In sacrifices the libation was always taken from a crater; and sailors, before they set out on their journey, used to take the libation with cups from a crater and pour it into the sea. The name crater was also sometimes used as synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">σιτλίον</foreign>, <seg lang="la">situla</seg>, a pail in which water was carried.</p>
 <p>The Romans used their <hi rend="italic">crater</hi> or <seg lang="la">cratera</seg> for the same purposes for which it was used in Greece; but the most elegant specimens were, like most works of art, made by Greeks. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaelatura">Caelatura</ref>.

<head orig="Cratīnus">Cratinus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κρατῖνος</foreign>). (1) An Athenian comic poet, born in B.C. 519. It was not till late in life that he directed his attention to comic compositions. The first piece of his on record is the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρχίλοχοι</foreign>, which was represented about B.C. 448, at which time he was in his seventy-first year. In this play, according to Plutarch (<title>Cimon</title>), he makes mention of the celebrated Cimon, who had died the preceding year, B.C. 449; and from the language employed by the poet it may be inferred that he was on terms of close intimacy with the Athenian general. Soon after this, comedy became so licentious and virulent in its personalities that the magistracy were obliged to interfere. A decree was passed, B.C. 440, prohibiting the exhibitions of comedy; which law continued in force only during that year and the two following, being repealed in the archonship of Euthymenes. Three victories of Cratinus stand recorded after the recommencement of comic performances. With the <foreign lang="greek">Χειμαζόμενοι</foreign> he was second, B.C. 425 (<title>Argum. Acharn.</title>), 
<pb n="426" /><cb />when the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαρνεῖς</foreign> of Aristophanes won the prize, and the third place was adjudged to the <foreign lang="greek">Νουμηνίαι</foreign> of Eupolis. In the succeeding year he was again second with the <foreign lang="greek">Σάτυροι</foreign>, and Aristophanes again first with the <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππεῖς</foreign> (<title>Argum. Equit.</title>). In a parabasis of this play that young rival makes mention of Cratinus; where, having noticed his former successes, he insinuates, under the cloak of an equivocal piety, that the veteran was becoming doting and superannuated. The old man, now in his ninety-fifth year, indignant at this insidious attack, exerted his remaining vigour, and composed, against the contests of the approaching season, a comedy entitled <foreign lang="greek">Πυτίνη</foreign>, or <title>The Flagon</title>, which turned upon the accusations brought against him by Aristophanes. The aged dramatist had a complete triumph (<title>Argum. Nub.</title>). He was first; while his humbled antagonist was vanquished also by Ameipsias with the <foreign lang="greek">Κόννος</foreign>, though the play of Aristophanes was the favourite <title>Nubes.</title> Notwithstanding his notorious intemperance, Cratinus lived to an extreme old age, dying B.C. 422, in his ninety-seventh year. Aristophanes alludes to the excesses of Cratinus in a passage of the <title>Equites</title> (v. 526 foll.). In the <title>Pax</title>, he humorously ascribes the jovial old poet's death to a shock on seeing a cask of wine staved and lost. Cratinus himself made no scruple of acknowledging his failing (Schol. <title>in Pac.</title> 703). Horace, also, opens one of his Epistles (i. 19) with a maxim of the comedian's, in due accordance with his practice. The titles of thirty-eight of the comedies of Cratinus have been collected. His style was bold and animated ( <bibl n="Pers.  1. 123" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.i. 123</bibl>), and like his younger brethren, Eupolis and Aristophanes, he fearlessly and unsparingly directed his satire against the iniquitous public officer and the profligate of private life. The fragments of Cratinus may be found in Meineke, <bibl default="NO"><title>Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum</title> (Berlin, 1840)</bibl>.</p>

Scipio retiring to Cremona ( <bibl n="Liv.  21. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxi. 56</bibl>), and it appears that the <cb /> Romans retained the place throughout the whole of the Second Punic War, though it suffered so much during its continuance, and afterwards from the attacks of the Gauls, that it was found necessary to recruit its population by a fresh supply of colonists. The colony, being thus renewed, continued to prosper for nearly a hundred and fifty years; when the Civil Wars, which ensued after the death of Caesar, materially affected its interests. Cremona, unfortunately, espoused the cause of Brutus, and thus incurred the vengeance of the victorious party. The loss of its territory, which was divided among the veteran soldiers of Augustus, is well known from the line of Vergil (<title>Eclog.</title> ix. 28), which is nearly repeated by Martial (viii. 55). The effect of this calamity would seem, however, to have been but temporary; and, in fact, we learn from Strabo that Cremona was accounted in his time one of the most considerable towns in the north of Italy. The civil wars which arose during the time of Otho and Vitellius were the source of much severer affliction to this city than any former evil, as the fate of the Empire was more than once decided between large contending armies in its immediate vicinity. After the defeat of Vitellius's party by the troops of Vespasian, it was entered by the latter (A.D. 69) and exposed to all the horrors that fire, the sword, and a licentious soldiery can inflict upon a city taken by storm. The conflagration of the place lasted four days. The indignation which this event excited throughout Italy seems to have been such that Vespasian, afraid of the odium it might attach to his party, used every effort to raise Cremona from its ruins by recalling the scattered inhabitants, reconstructing the public edifices, and granting the city fresh privileges.

<head orig="Creta">Creta</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κρήτη</foreign>; in Italian, Candia; in Turkish, Kirit). One of the largest islands of the Mediterranean Sea, at the south of all the Cyclades. Its name is derived by some from the Curetes, who are said to have been its first inhabitants; by others, from the nymph Creté, daughter of Hesperus; and <cb /> by others, from Cres, a son of Zeus and the nymph Idaea. It is also designated among the poets and mythological writers by the several appellations of Aeria, Doliché, Idaea, and Telchinia. According to Herodotus (bk. i.), this great island remained in the possession of various barbarous nations till the time of <ref type="cross" target="crossminos">Minos</ref> (q.v.), son of Europa, who, having expelled his brother Sarpedon, became the sole sovereign of the country. These early inhabitants are generally supposed to be the Eteocretes of Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 19. 172" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xix. 172</bibl>), who clearly distinguishes them from the Grecian colonists subsequently settled there.</p>
 <p>Minos, according to the concurrent testimony of antiquity, first gave laws to the Cretans, and, having conquered the pirates who infested the Aegean Sea, established a powerful navy. In the Trojan War, Idomeneus , sovereign of Crete, led its forces to the war in eighty vessels, a number little inferior to that commanded by Agamemnon himself. According to the traditions which Vergil has followed, Idomeneus was afterwards driven from his throne by faction, and compelled to sail to Iapygia, where he founded the town of Salernum. At this period the island appears to have been inhabited by a mixed population of Greeks and barbarians. Homer enumerates the former under the names of Achaei, Dorians, surnamed Trichaïces, and Pelasgi. The latter, who were the most ancient, are said to have come from Thessaly, under the conduct of Teutamus, posterior to the great Pelasgic emigration into Italy. The Dorians are reported to have established themselves in Crete, under the command of Althemenes of Argos, after the death of Codrus and the foundation of Megara. In Crete was the famous labyrinth whose construction was ascribed to Daedalus, and about which so many legends cluster. See <ref type="cross" target="crossariadne">Ariadné</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedalus">Daedalus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossicarus">Icarus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslabyrinthus">Labyrinthus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossminos">Minos</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossminotaurus">Minotaurus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspasiphae">Pasiphaé</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheseus">Theseus</ref>.</p>
 <p>After the Trojan War and the expulsion of Idomeneus , the principal cities of Crete formed themselves into several republics, for the most part independent, while others were connected by federal ties. These, though not exempted from the dissensions which so universally distracted the Grecian States, maintained for a long time a considerable degree of prosperity, owing to the good system of laws and education which had been so early instituted throughout the island by the decrees of Minos. The Cretan code was supposed by many of the best-informed writers of antiquity to have furnished Lycurgus with the model of his most salutary regulations. It was founded, according to Ephorus, cited by Strabo, on the just basis of liberty and an equality of rights; and its great aim was to promote social harmony and peace by enforcing temperance and frugality. On this principle, the Cretan youths were divided into classes called Agelae, and all met at the Andreia, or public meals. Like the Spartans, they were early trained to the use of arms, and inured to sustain the extremes of heat and cold, and undergo the severest exercise; they were also compelled to learn their letters and certain pieces of music. The chief magistrates, called Cosmi (<foreign lang="greek">κόσμοι</foreign>), were ten in number and elected annually. The Gerontes constituted the council of the nation, and were selected from those who were thought worthy of holding the office of Cosmus. There was also an equestrian order, who were bound to keep horses 
<pb n="428" /><cb />
 at their own expense. But though the Cretan laws resembled the Spartan institutions in so many important points, there were some striking features which distinguished the legislative enactments of the two countries. One of these was that the Lacedaemonians were subject to a strict agrarian law, whereas the Cretans were under no restraint as to the accumulation of moneyed or landed property; another, that the Cretan republics were for the most part democratic, whereas the Spartan was decidedly aristocratic. Herodotus informs us that the Cretans were deterred by the unfavourable response of the Pythian oracle from contributing forces to the Grecian armament assembled to resist the Persians (vii. 169). In the Peloponnesian War incidental mention is made of some Cretan cities as allied with Athens or Sparta, but the island does not appear to have espoused collectively the cause of either of the belligerent parties. The Cretan soldiers were held in great estimation as light troops and archers, and readily offered their services for hire to such States, whether Greek or barbarian, as needed them. In the time of Polybius the Cretans had much degenerated from their ancient character, for he charges them repeatedly with the grossest immorality and the most hateful vices. We know also with what severity they are reproved by St. Paul, in the words of one of their own poets, Epimenides ( <bibl n="Tit.  1. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Tit.i. 12</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The chief cities of Crete were Cnossus, Cydonia, Gortyna, and Lyctus, all of which see.</p>
 <p>The Romans did not interfere with the affairs of Crete before the war with Antiochus, when Q. Fabius Labeo crossed over into the island from Asia Minor, under pretence of claiming certain Roman captives who were detained there. Several years after, the island was invaded by a Roman army commanded by M. Antonius, under the pretence that the Cretans had secretly favoured the cause of Mithridates; but Florus more candidly avows that the desire of conquest was the real motive which led to this attack. The enterprise, however, having failed, the subjugation of the island was not effected till some years later by Metellus, who, from his success, obtained the agnomen of Creticus. It was then (B.C. 67) annexed to the Roman Empire, and formed, together with Cyrenaïca, one of its numerous provinces, being governed by the same proconsul.</p>
 <p>Crete forms an irregular parallelogram, of which the western side faces Sicily, while the eastern looks towards Cyprus; on the north it is washed by the Mare Creticum, and on the south by the Libyan Sea, which intervenes between the island and the opposite coast of Cyrené. Mount Ida, which surpasses all the other summits in elevation, rises in the centre of the island; its base occupies a circumference of nearly 600 stadia. To the west it is connected with another chain, called the White Mountains (<foreign lang="greek">Λευκὰ ὄρη</foreign>), and to the east its prolongation forms the ridge anciently known by the name of Dicté.

<head orig="Croesus">Croesus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κροῖσος</foreign>). The son of Alyattes, king of Lydia, and born about B.C. 590. He was the fifth and last of the Mermnadae, a family which began to reign with Gyges, who dethroned <ref type="cross" target="crosscandaules">Candaules</ref> (q.v.). According to the account of Herodotus, Croesus was the son of Alyattes by a Carian mother, and had a half-brother, named Pantaleon, the offspring of an Ionian woman. An attempt was made by a private foe of Croesus to hinder his accession to the throne and to place the kingdom in the hands of Pantaleon; but the plot failed ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 92</bibl>), although Stobaeus informs us that Croesus, on coming to the throne, divided the kingdom with his brother. Plutarch states that the second 
<pb n="430" /><cb />
 wife of Alyattes, wishing to remove Croesus, gave one of the cooks in the royal household a dose of poison to put into the bread she made for Croesus. The woman informed Croesus, and gave the poisoned bread to the queen's children; and the prince, out of gratitude, consecrated at Delphi a golden image of this cook three cubits high. Croesus ascended the throne on the death of his father, B.C. 560, and immediately undertook the subjugation of the Greek communities of Asia Minor (the Aeolians, Ionians, and Dorians), whose disunited state and almost continual wars with one another rendered his task an easy one. He contented himself, however, after reducing them beneath his sway, with merely imposing an annual tribute, and left their forms of government unaltered. When this conquest was effected, he turned his thoughts to the construction of a fleet, intending to attack the islands, but was dissuaded from his purpose by Bias of Priené ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 27</bibl>). Turning his arms, upon this, against the nations of Asia Minor, he subjected all the country lying west of the river Halys, except Cilicia and Lycia; and then applied himself to the arts of peace, and to the patronage of the sciences and of literature. He became famed for his riches and munificence. Poets and philosophers were invited to his court, and, among others, Solon, the Athenian, is said to have visited his capital, Sardis. Herodotus relates the conversation which took place between the latter and Croesus on the subject of human felicity, in which the Athenian offended the Lydian monarch by the little value which he attached to riches as a means of happiness ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 30</bibl>), and by his saying that no man should be called happy until his death.</p>
 <p>Not long after this, Croesus had the misfortune to lose his son Atys, who was accidentally killed by <ref type="cross" target="crossadrastus">Adrastus</ref> (q.v.), leaving him with only a dumb child as his heir; but the deep affliction into which this loss plunged him was dispelled in some degree, after two years of mourning, by a feeling of disquiet relative to the movements of Cyrus and the increasing power of the Persians. Wishing to form an alliance with the Greeks of Europe against the danger which threatened him, a step which had been recommended by the oracle at Delphi ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 53</bibl>), he ad<figure id="fig.00430">
<head orig="Croesus on the Pyre.">Croesus on the Pyre.</head>
</figure> dressed himself, for this purpose, to the Lacedaemonians, at that time the most powerful of the Grecian communities; and having <cb /> succeeded in his object, and made magnificent presents to the Delphic shrine, he resolved on open hostilities with the Persians. The art of the crafty priesthood who managed the machinery of the oracle at Delphi is nowhere more clearly shown than in the history of their royal dupe, the monarch of Lydia. He had lavished upon their temple the most splendid gifts—so splendid, in fact, that we should be tempted to suspect Herodotus of exaggeration if his account were not confirmed by other writers—and the recipients of this bounty, in their turn, put him off with an answer of the most studied ambiguity when he consulted their far-famed oracle on the subject of a war with the Persians. The response of Apollo was, that if Croesus made war upon this people “he would destroy a great Empire”; and the answer of Amphiaraüs (for his oracle, too, was consulted by the Lydian king) tended to the same effect ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 53</bibl>). The verse itself, containing the response of the oracle, is given by Diodorus (<title>Excerpt.</title> vii. 28), and is as follows: <foreign lang="greek">Κροῖσος, Ἅλυν διαβὰς, μεγάλην ἀρχὴν καταλύσει</foreign>, “Croesus, on having crossed the Halys, will destroy a great empire”—the river Halys being, as already remarked, the boundary of his dominions to the east. Croesus thought that the empire thus referred to was that of Cyrus; the issue, however, proved it to be his own.</p>
 <p>Having assembled a numerous army, the Lydian monarch crossed the Halys, invaded the territory of Cyrus, and a battle took place in the district of Pteria, but without any decisive result. Croesus, upon this, thinking his forces not sufficiently numerous, marched back to Sardis, disbanded his army, consisting entirely of mercenaries, and sent for succour to Amasis of Egypt and also to the Lacedaemonians, determining to attack the Persians again in the beginning of the next spring. But Cyrus did not allow him time to effect this. Having discovered that it was the intention of the Lydian king to break up his present army, he marched with all speed into Lydia, before a new mercenary force could be assembled, defeated Croesus (who had no force at his command but his Lydian cavalry) in the battle of Thymbra, shut him up in Sardis, and took the city itself after a siege of fourteen days and in the fourteenth year of the reign of the son of Alyattes.</p>
 <p>With Croesus fell the Empire of the Lydians. Herodotus relates two stories connected with this event—one having reference to the dumb son of Croesus, who spoke for the first time when he saw a soldier in the act of killing his father, and, by the exclamation which he uttered, saved his parent's life, the soldier being ignorant of his rank; and the other being as follows: Croesus having been made prisoner, a pile was erected, on which he was placed in order to be burned alive. After keeping silence for a long time, the royal captive heaved a deep sigh, and with a groan thrice pronounced the name of Solon. Cyrus sent to know the reason of this exclamation, and Croesus, after considerable delay, acquainted him with the conversation between himself and Solon. The Persian king, relenting upon this, gave orders for Croesus to be released. But the flames had already begun to ascend on every side of the pile, and all human aid proved ineffectual. In this emergency Croesus prayed earnestly to Apollo, the god on 
<pb n="431" /><cb />
 whom he had lavished so many splendid offerings. That deity heard his prayer, and a sudden and heavy fall of rain extinguished the flames ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 86" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 86</bibl> foll.). Croesus, after this, is said to have stood high in the favour of Cyrus, who profited by his advice on several important occasions; and Ctesias declares that the Persian monarch assigned him for his residence a city near Ecbatana, and that in his last moments he recommended Croesus to the care of his son and successor Cambyses; and entreated the Lydian, on the other hand, to be an adviser to his son. Croesus discharged this duty with so much fidelity as to give offence to the new monarch, who ordered him to be put to death. Happily for him, those who were charged with this order hesitated to carry it into execution; and Cambyses, soon after, having regretted his precipitation, Croesus was again brought into his presence and restored to his former favour. The rest of his history is unknown. As he was advanced in years, he could not have long survived Cambyses ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 36</bibl> foll.). The wealth of Croesus has passed into a proverb in all languages. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslydia">Lydia</ref>.

He took his sister Rhea to wife, and became by her father of Hestia, Demeter, Heré, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. But his mother prophesied that one of his children would overthrow him. He accordingly swallowed them all except Zeus, whom Rhea saved by a stratagem. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosszeus">Zeus</ref>.) Zeus, when grown up, obtained the assistance of the Ocean-nymph Thetis in making Cronus disgorge his children, and then, with the help of his kinsfolk, overpowered Cronus and the Titans. According to one version of the fable, Cronus was imprisoned in Tartarus with the Titans; according to another, he was reconciled with Zeus, and reigned with Rhadamanthus on the Islands of the Blessed.

His name being easily confused with that of Chronos (<foreign lang="greek">Χρόνος</foreign>, “Time”), he was afterwards erroneously regarded as the god of time.

<head orig="Crotōna">Crotona</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Croton</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Κρότων</foreign>). The modern Cotrone. A powerful city of Italy, in the Bruttiorum Ager, on the coast of the Sinus Tarentinus. Its foundation is ascribed to Myscellus, an Achaean leader, soon after Sybaris had been colonized by a party of the same nation, which was about B.C. 710. According to some traditions the origin of Crotona was much more ancient, and it is said to derive its name from the hero Croton. The residence of <ref type="cross" target="crosspythagoras">Pythagoras</ref> (q.v.) and his most distinguished followers in this city, together with the overthrow of Sybaris which it accomplished, and the exploits of <ref type="cross" target="crossmilo">Milo</ref> (q.v.) and of several other Crotonian victors in the Olympic Games, contributed in a high degree to raise its fame; and, in consequence, it was commonly said that the last athlete of Crotona was the first of the other Greeks. This city was also celebrated for its school of medicine, and was the birthplace of Democedes, who long enjoyed the reputation of being the first physician of Greece. About B.C. 510, Crotona sent an army of 100,000 men, commanded by the athlete Milo, against its powerful rival, <ref type="cross" target="crosssybaris">Sybaris</ref> (q.v.), by which the latter city was destroyed. The removal of its rival, however, produced an enervating effect upon Crotona. As a proof of the remarkable change which took place in the warlike spirit of this people, it is said that, on their being subsequently engaged in 
<pb n="432" /><cb />
 hostilities with the Locrians, an army of 130,000 Crotoniatae were routed by 10,000 of the enemy on the banks of the Sagras. Such was, indeed, the loss they experienced in this battle that, according to Strabo, their city henceforth rapidly declined, and could no longer maintain the rank it had long held among the Italian republics. Dionysius the Elder, who was then aiming at the subversion of all the States of Magna Graecia, having surprised the citadel, gained possession of the town, which, however, he did not long retain. Crotona was finally able to assert its independence against his designs, as well as the attacks of the Bruttii; and when Pyrrhus invaded Italy it was still a considerable city. But the consequences of the war which ensued with that king proved so ruinous to its prosperity that above one half of its extent became deserted. Crotona was then occupied by the Bruttii, with the exception of the citadel, in which the chief inhabitants had taken refuge; these, being unable to defend the place against a Carthaginian force, soon after surrendered, and were allowed to withdraw to Locri. Crotona eventually fell into the hands of the Romans, in B.C. 193, and a colony was established there.

He is best remembered by his elaborate commentary on Horace, which first appeared at Antwerp in 1578. A second and improved edition was issued in 1611. The value of this edition lies chiefly in the fact that it gives readings from four MSS., known as the Codices Blandinii, that were then preserved in the Benedictine monastery of Blankenberg (Mons Blandinius), and that were subsequently destroyed, possibly in the sack of the monastery by a mob in 1566 (Palmer). The importance of one of these MSS., known to Cruquius as <seg lang="la">vetustissimus</seg>, and now styled V, is very great, and the same thing is true of the marginal comments which it contained written by some unknown scholar, who is usually cited (from Cruquius) as the Commentator Cruquianus.

<head orig="Crux">Crux</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σταῦρός, σκόλοψ</foreign>). The cross; an instrument of capital punishment used from a very early period in the East.</p>
 <p>The words <foreign lang="greek">σταυρόω</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">σκολοπίζω</foreign> (more usually <foreign lang="greek">ἀνασταυρόω, ἀνασκολοπίζω</foreign>) are applied to modes of execution which were certainly common among the Persians; and it is probable that impalement, as well as actual crucifixion, was thus denoted. It has been doubted whether the later or Roman method of crucifixion was practised by the Persians; but the case of Artayctes ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 120" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 120</bibl>) seems to prove that nailing to a tree or plank was not unknown to them. It was the usual punishment of rebels—at least of those who headed revolt. Darius in the Behistun inscription boasts that he had “crucified” the leader of every rebellion that he had put down, giving their names (Rawlinson's <title>Herodotus</title>, vol. ii. Appendix); and it was inflicted on Inaros, the champion of Egyptian liberty ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 110" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 110</bibl>). For the sake of ignominy, the bodies of those who had been otherwise executed were sometimes exposed on a cross after death, not always from humanity. Oroetes, after putting Polycrates to death in some horrible way which Herodotus refuses to describe, crucified the corpse ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 125" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 125</bibl>). We find Xerxes thus treating the body of Leonidas, no doubt as a rebel ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 238" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 238</bibl>); and at a later period Ptolemy Philopator does the same to Cleomenes after his suicide ( <bibl n="Plut. Cleom. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Cleom.</title>38</bibl>). According to a strange story in Pliny , Tarquinius Priscus adopted this form of posthumous disgrace to check the frequency of suicide among the citizens, driven to despair by the forced labour with which his gigantic building operations were carried on ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  107" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 107</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Among ancient nations, the Carthaginians were conspicuous for their cruelty, and crucifixion was horribly frequent among them; it was probably through their example that it was subsequently introduced into Sicily and Italy. It was the usual punishment of rebels, and, as is well known, was commonly inflicted on unsuccessful generals (Polyb. i. 11, 24, 79, etc.). In the war with their mercenaries and African subjects which followed immediately upon the conclusion of the First Punic War, the atrocities on both sides, ghastly enough in the narrative of Polybius, have been sensationally exaggerated in Flaubert's novel <title>Salammbô.</title></p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greeks</hi> were honourably distinguished in the ancient world for their aversion to torture and mutilation in every shape; indeed, it is only in quite recent times that Christian Europe has attained the same standard of refinement. In some ways they could be cruel enough, and the frequency of capital punishments showed a singular disregard of human life. The rage of faction led to massacres like that of Corcyra, on which Thucydides moralizes in a well-known passage (iii. 81 foll.). Prisoners of war were put to death in cold blood— the Plataeans by the Spartans (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.68" default="NO" valid="yes">iii. 68</bibl>); 
<pb n="433" /><cb /> the Athenian prisoners after Aegospotami to the number of 3000 ( <title>Alcib.</title> 37; <title>Lysand.</title> 13). The Athenians ordered a massacre of all the adult males in Mitylené, probably as many as 6000 ( <bibl n="Thuc.  3. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iii. 36</bibl>).</p>
 <p>With all this, however, the Greeks habitually abstained from aggravating their executions, whether of criminals or prisoners of war, by insult and torture; and they especially abhorred outrages on women and children. This side of the Greek character is well brought out in Mahaffy's <title>Social Life in Greece;</title> see especially pp. 238, 262 foll., 3d ed. It was so from the earliest historical times. The tyrants of the seventh and sixth centuries are not charged with any atrocities like those of the Visconti and other mediaeval despots in Italy; even the bull of <ref type="cross" target="crossphalaris">Phalaris</ref> (q.v.) is now explained as an instrument of Phoenician Moloch-worship. A few isolated acts of vengeance are recorded of this period, only however in the outlying parts of the Grecian world, and therefore probably due to the contagion of barbarian example. During the struggles at Miletus between the wealthy citizens and the commonalty, the latter (who were called <foreign lang="greek">Γέργιθες</foreign>) when victorious collected the children of the rich upon threshing-floors and had them trampled to death by oxen; the rich, having in turn gained the upper hand, burnt in pitch (<foreign lang="greek">κατεπίττωσαν</foreign>: cf. the <seg lang="la">tunica molesta</seg> of Juvenal, viii. 235; <bibl n="Mart.  10. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 25</bibl>) all whom they got into their power, along with their children ( <hi rend="italic"> Pont.ap.</hi> <bibl n="Ath.  12. 524" default="NO">Ath.xii. 524</bibl> a). This story belongs probably to the “two generations” of civil strife at Miletus recorded by Herodotus; but no such horrors are mentioned in Greece proper, where even Helots and serfs ranked as Hellenes. Pisistratus and his sons governed according to the laws of Solon, and even the proceedings which arose out of the murder of Hipparchus fall short of the cruelties inflicted on regicides in quite recent times. There is, in fact, no evidence that crucifixion, impalement, and burning alive were regarded as Greek punishments, at least where, as in Hellas itself, there was no contact with less civilized races. It was the same with mutilations of all kinds, such as the blinding prescribed by the laws of Locri in Italy (Demosth. <title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 744. 140) or the cutting off of hands and feet as practised by the Persians ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1. 9. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Anab.</title>i. 9. 13</bibl>). The cruelties alluded to in  <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 186" default="NO" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title>186</bibl>-190, including impalement, are those not of Greeks, but of barbarians, and the distinction is pointedly drawn. The Greeks distinguished between reverence for the human body, for which they had a passionate admiration as shown in their athletic exercises and their works of art, and reverence for human life, which they held cheap enough. This feeling continued unimpaired as long as Greece retained her freedom.</p>
 <p>In the Macedonian period Greece no longer enjoyed this happy immunity; as a mere province in a larger Hellenism, it was influenced by lower and less humane races. Alexander himself is not free from the stain of cruelty, as is shown by his treatment of real or supposed conspiracies against his person in the cases of Philotas and Hermolaüs. He is said to have either hanged or crucified 2000 Tyrians; he certainly crucified Musicanus, the Indian rajah who had rebelled after being reinstated in his dominions (Arrian, <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 6. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>vi. 17</bibl>). His successors improved upon his example: a year after his death Perdiccas and Eumenes crucified the aged Ariarathes <cb /> of Cappadocia after other tortures ( <bibl n="Diod.  18. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xviii. 16</bibl>); Lysimachus threatened to crucify the Cyrenaic philosopher Theodorus, though an ambassador, but did not carry out his threat ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 1. 43. 102" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Tusc.</title>i. 43. 102</bibl>). Nicocreon of Cyprus, contemporary with Alexander, actually pounded the philosopher Anaxarchus to death in a mortar ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 2. 22. 52" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Tusc.</title>ii. 22. 52</bibl>). A similar story is told of an older philosopher, Zeno the Eleatic, and a tyrant of his native city ( Cic. l. c.); but the accounts are contradictory. Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, used as an engine of torture a figure studded with nails resembling the <title>Eiserne Jungfrau</title> of some German cities (Polyb. xiii. 7). It is not necessary to pursue the records of this period any further. The general aversion of the Greeks to degrading punishments was not understood by grammarians who lived under the law of the later Roman Empire, nor by scholars like Lipsius (<bibl default="NO"><title>De Cruce</title>, 1592</bibl>), in whose time even worse horrors were perpetrated.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi> were naturally a hard-hearted people, and Livy shows considerable audacity in saying that the dismembering of Mettius Fufetius was the only example in their history of a disregard of the laws of humanity; adding that they might boast that no nation had employed milder punishments (i. 28). From the language of Cicero (<title>Pro Rab. Perd.</title> 4. 13) it has been inferred that crucifixion was in use in the regal period. But the words of the old law point rather to simple hanging (<seg lang="la">infelici arbori reste suspendito</seg>, <bibl n="Liv.  1. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 26</bibl>), <figure id="fig.00433">
<head orig="Arbor Infelix. (Daremb. and Saglio.)">Arbor Infelix. (Daremb. and Saglio.)</head>
</figure> though the cross was no doubt called <seg lang="la">arbor infelix</seg> in later times. Cicero, who is arguing against the revival of the obsolete law of <seg lang="la">perduellio</seg> and the capital punishment of citizens in any shape, is speaking rhetorically throughout: he quotes the formula without the word <seg lang="la">reste</seg>, a misleading and doubtless intentional omission, and talks vaguely of the cross ( 10, 11, 16) and of the detested Tarquin ( 13). No historical conclusions can be drawn from a speech so obviously designed to confuse the questions at issue. It is highly probable that the Romans derived this punishment from the Carthaginians; at least no mention of it appears to occur before the Second Punic War. First we find Hannibal crucifying a guide who had misled him ( <bibl n="Liv.  22. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxii. 13</bibl>); then the Romans practise it on slaves and deserters ( <bibl n="Liv.  22. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxii. 33</bibl>; xxx. 43. 13; xxxiii. 36). This last passage describes a revolt among the slaves in Etruria, B.C. 196; the ringleaders are scourged and crucified, the rest given up to their masters to be dealt with at discretion. The enormous increase in the numbers of slaves under the later Republic heightened the dread of a rising among them, and the Roman system became more and more one of undisguised terrorism. Two desperate rebellions broke out in Sicily, and were only put down by regular armies—the first in B.C. 134-133, the second lasting four years, 102-99. After the pacification 
<pb n="434" /><cb />
 by the praetor M'. Aquillius in B.C. 99, a regulation was made, and strictly enforced by successive governors of the island, that no slave should be allowed to carry a weapon. A few years later, the praetor L. Domitius received a boar of remarkable size as a present; he inquired who had killed it, and finding that it was a slave employed as a shepherd, he summoned the man before him and asked him how he had contrived to destroy it. The shepherd, who expected a reward, replied that he had killed it with a boar-spear (<seg lang="la">venabulo</seg>); upon which Domitius at once ordered him to be crucified. Cicero tells this story with only faint disapproval, while he dwells complacently on the fact that there were no more revolts of the slaves in Sicily ( <title>in Verr.</title> v. 3, 4. 7, 8). When the servile war of Spartacus was at last put down by Crassus, the prisoners, to the number of 6000, were crucified all along the Appian Way, between Capua and Rome ( <title>B. C.</title> i. 120). The power of masters over their slaves was at this period, and for some time later, absolute; even the good-natured Horace treats as a joke the possibility of their being crucified for slight offences ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 3</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 80" default="NO"> Sat., 80</bibl> foll.). The first measure passed in their favour was the Lex Petronia (q. v.); Hadrian forbade them to be executed without the sentence of a magistrate; Antoninus Pius ordered that the murder of a slave by his master should be punished as homicide. Besides slaves, the provincials were liable to crucifixion for the greater crimes, such as murder, piracy ( <title>Iul.</title> 4), brigandage, and especially for revolts and conspiracies. The obstinacy of the Jews was particularly exasperating to the Romans, and their repeated rebellions were followed by the wholesale infliction of this punishment; thus Varus (the same who perished in Germany) crucified 2000 at once (Joseph. <bibl n="Fro. Ant. 17. 10. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>xvii. 10. 10</bibl>); Gessius Florus several hundreds, including Roman citizens of Jewish birth (id. <title>B. I.</title> ii. 14. 9); Titus so many that “room was wanting for the crosses, and crosses for the bodies” (id. ib. vi. 28); and Hadrian, after the final revolt, 500 a day for some time. Under the Empire the right of the <title>civis Romanus</title> was no longer respected; the first instance, probably, of the crucifixion of a citizen in Rome itself is that, under Galba, of a guardian who poisoned his ward ( <bibl n="Plut. Galb. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Galb.</title>9</bibl>). Afterwards the odious distinction between the <seg lang="la">honestiores</seg> and <seg lang="la">humiliores</seg> was introduced, and this and other tortures were freely inflicted upon the latter, especially for <seg lang="la">maiestas</seg> or crimes against the State or the person of the emperor ( <bibl n="Paul. Sent. 5. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul. <title>Sent.</title>v. 23</bibl><bibl n="Paul. Sent. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul. Sent., 1</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 48, 19, tit. <seg lang="la">de poenis</seg>).</p>
 <p>The mode of punishment is too well known to need much description. Scourging, as with Roman capital punishments in general, usually preceded it. Three kinds of crosses were in common use: the <seg lang="la">crux commissa</seg>, or T shape; the <seg lang="la">crux immissa</seg>, with a projection at the top, to which was affixed the <seg lang="la">titulus</seg>, setting forth the crime of the sufferer (this was the most common); and the <seg lang="la">crux decussata</seg>, in the shape of an X (St. Andrew's cross). The word <hi rend="italic">crux</hi> is also applied to the single stake used in impalement; the latter process is alluded to by Seneca in two passages, but, as he is speaking of death by torture in general, it may be doubted, in the absence of direct evidence, whether this was a Roman custom (<title>Cons. ad Marciam</title>, 20. 3, where crucifixion with the head downward is mentioned). The upright post is called <seg lang="la">stipes</seg>, the <cb /> transverse beam <seg lang="la">patibulum;</seg> and it was this, rather than the entire instrument, which the criminal carried to the place of execution (Plaut. <title>Mostell.</title> i. 1, 53, and <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. s. v. <seg lang="la">patibulum</seg>). It was impossible that the whole weight of the body should rest upon the nails; hence there was a piece of <figure id="fig.00434">
<head orig="Patibulum. (Daremberg and Saglio.)">Patibulum. (Daremberg and Saglio.)</head>
</figure> wood projecting from the <seg lang="la">stipes</seg> on which the sufferer sat, or rather rode (Tertull. <title>adv. Nat.</title> i. 12; cf. <title>adv. Haer.</title> i. 12). The expression <seg lang="la">acuta si sedeam cruce</seg>, in the famous lines of Maecenas <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi>  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 101" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>101</bibl>, probably refers to this support, and not, as Lipsius thought, to impalement. When it was wanting, the body was probably sustained by ropes; the combination of ropes with nails is mentioned by Pliny as charms ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 28.  46" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxviii. 46</bibl>). See <ref type="cross" target="crosseculeus">Eculeus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The martyrologies contain accounts of sufferers bound to the cross without the use of nails, and left to die of hunger and exhaustion; when it is added that in some instances they survived nine days, we must be allowed to disbelieve. The criminal was stripped of his clothes—the cloth around the loins, as to which the Christian tradition is constant, seems to have been exceptional— and usually hoisted on to the cross after it had been set up. Sometimes he was stretched upon it on the ground, and then lifted with it; but the former method was the commoner, and hence the phrases <seg lang="la">cruci suffigere, in crucem agere</seg> or <seg lang="la">tollere</seg>, occur oftener than <seg lang="la">cruci affigere.</seg> The well-known breaking of the legs to hasten death is alluded to by Plautus ( <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 4. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poen.</title>iv. 2</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Poen. 64" default="NO" valid="yes"> Poen., 64</bibl>) and Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 13. 12. 27" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phil.</title>xiii. 12. 27</bibl>). The dead body was generally left hanging on the cross, to be devoured by birds and beasts; the feet were but little raised above the ground (not as in most pictures), and it was not out of the reach of the latter ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 16</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 48</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  14. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xiv. 77</bibl>). Sepulture was therefore forbidden, and a soldier set to watch the corpse ( <bibl n="Petron.  111" default="NO">Petron.111</bibl><bibl n="Petron.  112" default="NO">Petron., 112</bibl>). The place for these executions was always outside the walls of cities; at Rome it was the Campus Esquilinus, to the east of the city, part of which was afterwards occupied by the gardens of Maecenas.</p>
 <p>With the establishment of Christianity the associations connected with the Cross led to its abolition, though not from humanity, as other cruel punishments were retained. Constantine at the beginning of his reign had sanctioned it in the case of slaves and freedmen, but later he abolished it.</p>

<head orig="Cryptīa">Cryptia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κρυπτεία, κρυπτία</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">κρυπτή</foreign>). A system of secret police adopted by the Spartans in order to maintain their control over the Helots; perhaps, as Grote thinks, over the Perioeci also. As to the main features of this system there is no doubt. We learn that a number of active young Spartans were despatched every year by the Ephors, immediately upon their entry into office, to the different parts of the country. They were to post themselves as secretly as possible in convenient places from which to explore the neighbourhood and to make observations. If they found anything suspicious, they were either to report it or to suppress it themselves on the spot (Schömann, <title>Antiq.</title> i. 195, Eng. trans.). The institution served not merely to break up organization and to check the possibility of an outbreak among their oppressed subjects, but as a useful military training in habits of endurance suited to a dominant race. On the latter ground it is proposed by Plato for his ideal Cretan colony in the <title>Laws</title>, and his way of expressing himself shows that he is referring to a Spartan custom really existing (i. 633 B; vi. 763 B; cf. Grote, ii. 144 n.). The <hi rend="italic">cryptia</hi> may thus be considered as to a certain extent a species of armed police force, and the young men who were ordered to undertake it appear also to have formed a special corps in the army; at least we read of a commander of the <hi rend="italic">cryptia</hi> in the battle of Sellasia ( <bibl n="Plut. Cleom. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Cleom.</title>28</bibl>). To these undoubted facts later authors added some curious statements, which have been much criticised in recent times. According to Plutarch, who quotes Aristotle as his authority, the Ephors every year declared war formally against the Helots, in order that they might be killed without scruple; and they further, not every year as sometimes stated, but at intervals (<foreign lang="greek">διὰ χρόνου</foreign>), sent young Spartans armed with daggers to assassinate such of the Helots as were thought formidable ( <title>Lycurg.</title> 28). The language of Plutarch is somewhat loose. In one sentence he states that the young men went out into the roads by night and slew all whom they caught (<foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἁλισκομένους</foreign>), implying that the Helots lived under a sort of “curfew” law, which confined them to their houses at night to prevent conspiracies; in the next sentence that they often ranged over the fields, and despatched the strongest and bravest of them. The latter phrase, however, agrees with the account of Heraclides Ponticus that they killed <foreign lang="greek">ὅσους ἂν ἐπιτήδειον ᾖ</foreign> (<title>Fragm.</title> ii. 4 <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> C. Müller, ii. 210). Otfried Müller, whose criticism habitually tends to soften the harsher features of the Spartan institutions, combats the notion that the Helots were annually hunted down and destroyed (<title>Dorians</title>, iii. 3. 4); and Schömann calls it “an exaggeration which is really too absurd to deserve serious confutation” (<title>Antiq.</title> l. c.). Grote, no friend to Sparta, rejects the annual or periodical massacre of the Helots and the formal declaration of war against them, which, he justly observes, “would provoke the reaction of despair rather than enforce tranquillity”; and even suggests a doubt as to the fact of Aristotle's having really made the statement ascribed <cb /> to him by Plutarch, on the ground that he does not mention the subject in his <title>Politics</title>, where he speaks at some length both of the Spartan constitution and of the Helots.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κτησίας</foreign>). A Greek historian, born in Cnidus in Caria, and a contemporary of Xenophon. He belonged to the family of the Asclepiadae at Cnidus. In B.C. 416, he went to the Persian court, and became private physician to King Artaxerxes Mnemon. In this capacity he accompanied the king on his expedition against his brother Cyrus, and cured him of the wound which he received in the battle of Cunaxa, B.C. 401. In 399, he returned to his native city, and worked up the valuable material which he had collected during his residence in Persia, partly from his own observation and partly from his study of the royal archives, into a History of Persia (<foreign lang="greek">Περσικά</foreign>), in twenty-three books. The work was written in the Ionic dialect. The first six books treated the history of Assyria, the remaining ones that of Persia from the earliest times to events within his own experience. Ctesias's work was much used by the ancient historians, though he was censured as untrustworthy and indifferent to truth—a charge which may be due to the fact that he followed Persian authorities, and thus often differed, to the disadvantage of the Greeks, from the version of facts current among his conntrymen. Only fragments and extracts of the book survive, and part of an abridgment in Photius (<title>Cod.</title> 72). The same is true of his <foreign lang="greek">Ἰνδικά</foreign>, or notices of the researches which he had made in Persia on the geography and productions of India.

 <p> An hydraulic engine named after its inventor, <ref type="cross" target="crossctesibius">Ctesibius</ref> (q.v.) of Alexandria. In the language of modern hydraulics it is a double-action forcing pump. Vitruvius, in his description (x. 10 [7]), speaks of it as designed to raise water, while Ctesibius's pupil, Hero (<title>Pneumat.</title> p. 180), describes, under the name of <foreign lang="greek">σίφων</foreign>, a machine identical in principle, but of improved construction, and says that it was used as a fireengine (<foreign lang="greek">εἰς τοὺς ἐμπρησμούς</foreign>).

The remains of such a <foreign lang="greek">σίφων</foreign> were discovered at Castrum Novum, near Cività Vecchia, in 1795, having probably served to supply the public baths with water.</p>

When this stream ceases, the valve falls; and if the piston is forced down, the water is driven out of the cylinder into the pipe, and past the valve into the receiver, and retained there by the closing of the valve.

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Jacques de Cujas</hi>). A distinguished expounder of the Roman law. He was born at Toulouse in 1522, the son of a tanner, and after being educated in the law, lectured at Cahors in 1554, becoming in the following year professor in the University of Bourges. From this seat of learning he was called to Valence in 1557, returning to Bourges in 1576. He died October 4th, 1590. Cujacius won a remarkable reputation by his study of the MSS. of the Roman juristic writings, and by his brilliant emendations that served to remove much of the obscurity that had enveloped the nicer questions of Roman law. These emendations were published in part in the work entitled <title>Observationum et Emendationum Libri XVIII</title>—a treatise that contemporary writers styled <seg lang="la">opus incomparabile.</seg> He also published editions of the Institutes, Pandects, etc., of Justinian, a part of the Theodosian Code, a Greek version of the Justinian laws, besides commentaries on the <title>Consuetudines Feudorum</title>, and on several books of the Decretals. His <title>Observationes</title> included a wide range of classical reading and criticism, so that he is frequently cited by philologists and students of the ancient literatures as well as by jurists.</p>

 <p> “The Gnat.” A poem often ascribed to Vergil, who is, in fact, known to have composed in his youth a poem with that title ( <title>Silvae</title>, ii. 7, 73; <title>Vit. Lucani.</title> p. 50, Reiff.). The internal evidence is, however, against the view that the one now extant is the original, though some scholars (as Heyne and Hildebrandt) have supposed it to be the same with later interpolations. The  <title>Culex</title>is a short epic of 414 hexameter lines, whose subject may be considered as partly pastoral and partly mock-heroic. A goatherd leads out his flocks to feed upon the pastures near Mount Cithaeron. Having fallen asleep, he is suddenly roused from his slumbers by the bite of a gnat; and, while awakening, he crushes to death the insect which had inflicted the wound. He then perceives a huge serpent approaching, which, if his sleep had not been broken, would inevitably have destroyed him. The shade of the gnat appears to the goatherd on the following night, and reproaches him with having occasioned its death at the moment when it had saved his life. The insect describes all that it had seen in the infernal regions during its wanderings, having as yet obtained no fixed habitation. Next day the goatherd prepares a tomb, in order to procure repose for the ghost of his benefactor, and celebrates in due form its obsequies. See Birt, <bibl default="NO"><title>Hist. Hexam.

<head orig="Cumae">Cumae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύμη</foreign>). A town of Campania, the most ancient of the Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily. It was founded from Cymé in Aeolis, in conjunction with Chalcis and Eretria in Euboea ( Strab. p. 243;  <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 2</bibl>). Its foundation is placed in B.C. 1050, but the date must be regarded as uncertain. It was situated on a steep hill of Mount Gaurus, a little north of the promontory Misenum. It became in early times a great and flourishing city; its commerce was extensive; its territory included a great part of the rich Campanian plain; its population was at least 60,000; and its power is attested by its colonies in Italy and Sicily—Puteoli, Palaeopolis (afterwards Neapolis), Zanclé (afterwards Messana). But it had powerful enemies to encounter in the Etruscans and the Italian nations. It was also weakened by internal dissensions, and one of its citizens, Aristodemus, made himself tyrant of the place. Its power became so much reduced that it was only saved from the attacks of the Etruscans by the assistance of Hiero, who annihilated the Etruscan fleet, 474. It maintained its independence till 417, when it was taken by the Campanians and most of its inhabitants sold as slaves ( <bibl n="Diod.  12. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xii. 76</bibl>). From this time Capua became the chief city of Campania; and although Cumae was subsequently a Roman municipium and a colony, it continued to decline in importance. At last the Acropolis was the only part of the town that remained, and this was eventually destroyed by Narses in his wars with the Goths. Cumae was celebrated as the residence of the earliest Sibyl, and as the place where Tarquinius Superbus died. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibyllae</ref>.

<head orig="Cuneiform">Cuneiform</head>

 <p> A name given to the form of writing whose characters resemble a wedge (<seg lang="la">cuneus</seg>). The French equivalent is <foreign lang="fr">tête-à-clou;</foreign> the German, <foreign lang="de">keilformig;</foreign> and in English, the terms “cuneatic” and “arrow-headed” are sometimes used as synonyms. This species of writing was employed by the ancient Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Armenians, Elamites, and Persians, who have left us specimens of it upon clay, stone, metal, and glass, either moulded (as in the clay) or cut and chiselled (as upon the other substances). The use of the cuneiform characters dates from a period not later than B.C. 3800, and was continued until a century or so after the beginning of the Christian era. The oldest specimen now known to exist is an inscription upon a bit of porphyry assigned to the time of Sargon of Agadé. The latest example is preserved at Munich, and is as late as A.D. 80.</p>
 <p>It is only in the present century that scholars have been able to decipher the cuneatic characters, and to interpret satisfactorily the inscriptions that contain them. It was, in fact, many years before any one conceived the notion that the curious arrow-headed marks on the vast ruins of Persepolis and other parts of Persia had anything to do with language at all. It was in 1618 that an inkling of the truth first entered the mind of Garcia de Silva Figuëroa, an ambassador of Philip III. of <cb /> Spain. In that year he visited Persepolis, and, becoming imbued with a belief that the arrow-heads were some form of writing, had a portion of one inscription copied. This he carried back to Europe, where it attracted the attention of other savants. In 1674, the French traveller Chardin, after visiting Persepolis, published copies of three sets of inscriptions, with an account of the curious characters as observed by him, pronouncing them to be writing and not hieroglyphs, but expressing his conviction that no one would ever be able to decipher them. More than a century later <bibl default="NO">(in 1782)</bibl>, a French botanist named Michaux sent to Paris a stone which he had found at Bagdad covered with cuneiforms. By this time the curiosity of the learned had become awakened, and the mystery surrounding these inscriptions excited the interest of the ablest scholars of Europe, who gradually accumulated a large number of specimens of the cuneiform, as other travellers brought back from the East valuable materials for study. It was long, however, before anything beyond mere conjecture was attained; and many varied and conflicting theories were put forward. The characters were said to be only fanciful designs of the Oriental architects and devoid of meaning. Again, they were explained (by Witte of Rostock) as due to the work of many generations of worms. Others explained them as the writing of the Guebres. Still others viewed them as charms, cabalistic signs, or astrological formulae. Lichtenstein thought that he had found in them certain passages from the Korân written in Kufic. Kaempfer hesitated whether to explain them as Chinese or as modifications of the Hebrew. Other scholars pronounced them Runes, Oghams, Old Greek, or Samaritan.</p>
 <p>The first light on this apparently insoluble problem was due to the acute researches of Karsten Niebuhr, who, without professing to read or interpret the inscriptions, proved the existence in them of three distinct varieties of cuneiform alphabet, instead of the single one that had been assumed before his time. The threefold inscriptions at Persepolis he then rightly explained as transcriptions of the same matter in the three alphabets. This brilliant discovery was developed by Tychsen of Rostock <bibl default="NO">(1798)</bibl> and Münter of Copenhagen <bibl default="NO">(1800)</bibl>, whose labours cleared the way for the magnificent success of Georg Friedrich <ref type="cross" target="crossgrotefend">Grotefend</ref> (q.v.), who, on September 7th, 1802, presented to the Academy of Göttingen the first cuneiform alphabet with its phonetic equivalents. It may be observed that this date and meeting are doubly important in the history of language-study, for then was also presented the first reading of the Egyptian hieroglyphs by Heyne. Twenty years later, St. Martin demonstrated a part of the flexional system; and Burnouf, Lassen, Westergaard, Beer, Jacques, and finally Sir Henry Rawlinson followed, each with his contributions towards a more perfect understanding of the characters and of the language which they embodied. Rawlinson, it may be remarked, was the first to read and publish the 1000 or more lines of the great Behistun inscription. (See the <title>Journal of the Asiatic Society</title> for 1846.)</p>
 <p>Inscriptions in the Persian cuneiform are usually in three parallel columns, being the same text translated into three languages and alphabets: Persian, Median (also called Scythic and New Susian), and Babylonian—these being the three great peoples under the dominion of the Achaemenian kings, who thus promulgated their decrees in three languages.

 <p>(1) Babylonian. This is the most ancient and most important of the three varieties of cuneiform. With it are inscribed tablets and cylinders, giving a vast amount of information on history, archaeology, law, government, and mythology.</p>
 <p>(2) Scythic. The Scythic cuneiform is never found alone (with one exception), and represents an alphabet of some 100 characters. The language which they embody is an Ugro-Finnic dialect, of which little as yet is known.</p>
 <p>(3) Persian. The Persian cuneiform, which always stands first in the trilingual inscriptions, is the most recent of the three, and consists of some 44 characters. It is characterized by an oblique stroke which divides its words, and the wedges of which it is composed never cross one another. The language of the Persian cuneiform is cognate with the Avestan, and is the parent tongue of the modern Persian. This character was used in the period from B.C. 570-370. In it is written the great inscription of Darius Hystaspis at Behistun, containing a genealogical record, a description of the extent of his dominions, a list of the great events <figure id="fig.00439.2">
<head orig="The Name Darius (Dâryavas) in Cuneiform Characters.">The Name Darius (Daryavas) in Cuneiform Characters.</head>
</figure> <cb /> of his reign, with prayers to Ormuzd and the spirits. Most of these inscriptions have been found at <ref type="cross" target="crosspersepolis">Persepolis</ref> (q.v.), Behistun, Naksh-i-Rustam, and Hamadan.</p>
 <p>The cuneiform characters were originally pictures of the objects which they stood for (ideographs), like the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the earlier characters in Chinese; but as time went on the forms were modified and simplified so as to lose their pictorial character, though a few still suggest the primitive design.</p>
 <p>At first they were drawn in outline on a vegetable substance (<hi rend="italic">likhusi</hi>), but a little later on clay, to the difficulties of which are due the first modification in the original shapes of the letters. The subsequent use of stone and metal carried this modification still further. An archaic revival, however, set in during the age of Assurbani-pal, when it became customary to use once more the most ancient characters. The signs, originally ideographic, became subsequently phonetic, denoting each a syllable. The cuneiform syllabary contains in all some 2000 signs—ideographic, syllabic, or purely phonetic—being sometimes used in one way and sometimes in another.</p>
 <p>The characters were inscribed upon stone, glass, and metal with a chisel; and upon clay with a sharp-pointed stylus having three unequal faces— the largest for the outer and thickest wedges of the letters, the medium-sized for the medium <figure id="fig.00439.3">

</figure> strokes, and the smallest for the finer lines. The Babylonian clay tablets or “bricks” are in size from one inch upward, pillow-shaped, and covered with characters often so minute as to be difficult to read without a magnifying glass. (See illustration on page 179.) After the inscriptions had been made, the tablet was dried in the sun and then enclosed in a case on which the inscription was duplicated. These are styled “case-tablets.” Tablets were also used by the Assyrians, especially by the literary classes; but the records of this people were very often carved upon the stone panels of their palaces and on colossal human-headed bulls. Cuneiforms have been found, likewise, on amethyst, jasper, and onyx.

<head orig="Curātor">Curator</head>

 <p> Curators were persons appointed either by law or by the magistrate to look after the property of certain classes of people, and to prevent its being squandered, because they were unfit or unable to properly take charge of it themselves. Those classes are mainly four: minors or <seg lang="la">adulescentes</seg> (i. e. persons who were <seg lang="la">sui iuris</seg> and between the age of puberty—twelve or fourteen [<bibl n="Gaius  1. 196" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, i. 196</bibl>; <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 22" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 22</bibl>, pr.]—and twenty-five years); lunatics; interdicted prodigals; and a miscellaneous class, the <seg lang="la">cura</seg> of which was considerably later in origin.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">cura</seg> of minors is to be attributed to the fact that when a young person who was <seg lang="la">sui iuris</seg> reached puberty, and escaped from the supervision of his guardian (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstutela">Tutela</ref>), he was regarded as having attained his full stature, intellectual no less than physical; he might marry and become a paterfamilias; he was liable to military service, entitled to vote in the comitia, and competent to hold public office; and he had the complete management of his own affairs. But it was felt to be a matter of necessity to give him some legal protection against designing and unscrupulous persons, for it became clear that his indiscretion and ignorance of business would frequently lead to his being overreached; and this was done, without interfering with the principle that full legal capacity was attained with puberty, by the Lex Plaetoria, passed certainly before B.C. 183, for it is mentioned by Plautus (<title>Pseud.</title> i. 3, 69), who died in that year. This statute (which appears to have first established the distinction between minority and full age) protected minors by subjecting any one who fraudulently overreached them to a <seg lang="la">iudicium publicum</seg> or prosecution ( <title>de Off.</title> iii. 15. 61), entailing a pecuniary fine and infamia on conviction; and after the introduction of <seg lang="la">exceptiones</seg> by the praetor, a minor who was fraudulently induced to enter into a contract could protect himself against action brought thereon by pleading the <title>exceptio legis Plaetoriae.</title> It being unlikely that in the face of this stringent procedure any one would have any dealings with minors whatever, the statute (Capitol. <bibl n="Luc. Macr. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Macr.</title>10</bibl>) apparently went on to provide that minors who wished to contract or deal with other persons, especially in the way of stipulation (Priscian, viii. 4; xviii. 9) and loan, should be compellable to receive a curator on their application, by whose assent to the transaction the penal consequences of the law should be avoided.</p>
 <p>The principle of the Lex Plaetoria was carried still further by the praetor, who by means of <seg lang="la">in integrum restitutio</seg> protected minors generally against indiscretion causing them proprietary loss (<seg lang="la">laesio</seg>); he would set aside transactions into which they had entered, not only on the ground of fraud, but on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case, provided application were made to him with in a year after the attainment of majority. 
<pb n="441" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Gaius , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>1</bibl><bibl n="Flor. Epit. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> Epit., 8</bibl>) seems to have extended the scope of the <seg lang="la">cura</seg> of minors by providing that a minor might, on application to the proper magistrate, obtain a permanent curator to look generally after his property and aid him with advice. The principle was that he could not be compelled to have a general curator unless he pleased, except where he was involved in litigation; when a person who owed him money wished to discharge his debt and obtain a release (<title>Dig.</title> iv. 4, 7, 2); and possibly where he had disregarded the advice given to him by his guardian, on reaching puberty, to get one appointed for him. But apparently most minors were induced by the convenience of the system to have general curators to assist and advise them (Ulpian, <bibl n="Nep. Reg. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Reg.</title>12</bibl><bibl n="Nep. Reg. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> Reg., 4</bibl>; Dio Cass. lii. 20).</p>
 <p>The curators of minors were always appointed by the magistrate; a testamentary appointment in itself was void, though the magistrate would usually confirm it by nominating the same person ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 23</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 1</bibl>; cf. Dio Cassius, xliv. 35); and, according to rule, the minor had to apply for a curator himself. The <seg lang="la">munus</seg> was a public one, and could not be declined except on specific grounds, carefully enumerated in the authorities ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i.</bibl> tit. 25); many curators had to give security that they would diligently look after the interests intrusted to them; and if suspected of malversation or negligence, they could be removed by the magistrate, and in cases of fraud were liable to the <seg lang="la">suspecti crimen</seg>, a quasi-criminal prosecution ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i.</bibl> tit. 26).</p>
 <p>A minor was fully competent to perform legal acts, such as the conveyance of property or the making of contracts; but whether such legal acts had their full usual effect or not depended on whether they were sanctioned by the curator. Both alienations and contracts were <seg lang="la">primâ facie</seg> binding on him; but against both, if they were seriously prejudicial, or the curator's consensus had not been given, he could get himself <seg lang="la">in integrum restitutus</seg> by the magistrate (<title>Cod.</title> ii. 22, 3); and if the curator had not assented to a contract, he could not be compelled to disburse anything from the minor's property in discharge of it, or to pay costs or damages of actions brought in respect thereof by the other party. But a series of imperial enactments (<title>Cod.</title> v. 71, 16; v. 37, 22) placed him under very stringent regulations in respect of alienation of the ward's property, which as a general rule was not allowed without permission from a magistrate. If a minor wished to give himself in adrogation the curator's consent was necessary.</p>
 <p>The cura of <seg lang="la">furiosi</seg> (lunatics and idiots) and interdicted prodigals or spendthrifts originated with the Twelve Tables, which placed <seg lang="la">furiosi</seg> under the cura of their nearest agnates, or, if there were no agnates, of their gentiles. Similarly the near relations of a <seg lang="la">prodigus</seg> might petition the magistrate for his interdiction from the management of his own affairs, and his subjection to the cura of his nearest agnates, though only if his property had come to him by the intestacy of his own father. In default of these <seg lang="la">legitimi curatores</seg>, one would be appointed for such persons by the magistrate ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 23</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 3</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In the time of Justinian other classes of persons were able to get a general curator by application to the magistrate, especially those suffering from weak health, impaired mental faculties, or bodily <cb /> infirmity—e. g. the deaf and dumb ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 23</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 4</bibl>). Similarly it would sometimes happen that an <seg lang="la">impubes</seg> would have a curator as well as a guardian —e. g. if there was litigation between himself and the latter ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 21</bibl><bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 3</bibl>), or if the latter was unfit or temporarily unable to discharge his duties (ib. 23<bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 5</bibl>).</p>
 <p>It will appear from what has been said that between a guardian and a curator an essential distinction lies in this, that the latter was especially intended to look after the ward's proprietary interests, whereas the former was <seg lang="la">personae, non rei datus.</seg></p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">cura</seg> has also other legal applications: (1) <seg lang="la">cura bonorum</seg>, as in the case of the goods of an insolvent debtor, which are secured for the benefit of his creditors;</p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">cura bonorum et ventris</seg>, in the case of a woman being pregnant at the death of her husband;</p>
 <p>(3) <seg lang="la">cura hereditatis</seg>, where there is a dispute as to who is the <seg lang="la">heres</seg> of a person, and his supposed child is under puberty;</p>
 <p>(4) <seg lang="la">cura hereditatis iacentis</seg>, the charge of an inheritance of which the apparent heir has not yet declared his acceptance;</p>
 <p>(5) <seg lang="la">cura bonorum absentis</seg>, in the case of property of an absent person who had appointed no manager of it.

<head orig="Curia">Curia</head>

 <p> A word which signifies both a division of the Roman people and the place of assembly for such a division.</p>
 <p>(1) Each of the three ancient Romulian tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, was subdivided into ten curiae, so that the whole body of the populus was divided into thirty curiae ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 13</bibl>). It has commonly been asserted that the plebeians had no connection whatever with the curiae, and that the clients of the patricians were members of the curiae only in a passive sense. But Mommsen has adduced strong reasons for denying the purely patrician character of the curiae (<title>Röm. Forsch.</title> i. 140-150), and accepting the view of Dionysius (iv. 12, 20) that plebeians were admitted. In B.C. 209, we find a plebeian elected as Curio Maximus, and, according to all analogy, plebeians must have been admitted to the curiae long before one of them could be found holding the highest post of dignity. Plebeians also are represented as existing and voting side by side with patricians before the institution of any other than the Comitia Curiata. The extinction of the functions of the curiae is nowhere mentioned as a result of the decay of the patriciate. Again, the thirty lictors who represented the curiae, and therefore must have had the right of voting there, were plebeians. There is no reason whatever to believe that the right of making wills and adoptions before the curiae was limited to patricians, and we have one positive instance of a plebeian adopting before the curiae in the case of Clodius. Hence the common theory of the purely patrician character of the curiae must be abandoned. <cb /> There is no historical evidence to show when the plebeians became members of them, but it is a reasonable conjecture that they were admitted at the time of the expulsion of the kings, when the Comitia Curiata lost their political power by the development of the Comitia Centuriata (Mommsen, <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 264" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 264</bibl>). All the members of the different gentes belonging to one curia were called, in respect of one another, <seg lang="la">curiales.</seg> Each curia as a corporation had its peculiar <seg lang="la">sacra</seg> ( Fest. pp. 174<bibl n="Fest.  245" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 245</bibl>), and besides the gods of the State they worshipped other divinities and with peculiar rites and ceremonies. For such religious purposes each curia had its own place of worship, called <seg lang="la">curia</seg>, which at first may have contained nothing but an altar, afterwards a <seg lang="la">sacellum</seg>, and finally a building in which the curiales assembled for the purpose of discussing political, financial, religious, and other matters (Paul. Diac. pp. 62, 64; <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 50" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 50</bibl>). The religious affairs of each curia were taken care of by a priest, <seg lang="la">curio</seg>, who was assisted by another called Flamen Curialis. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurio">Curio</ref>.) The thirty curiae had their own distinct names, which are said to have been derived from the names of the Sabine women who had been carried off by the Romans, though it is evident that some derived their names from certain districts or from ancient eponymous heroes. Few of these names only are known, such as curia Titia, Faucia, Calabra, Foriensis, Rapta, Veliensis, Tifata (Paul. Diac. pp. 49, 366; Fest. p. 174; <bibl n="Liv.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 13</bibl>). O. Gilbert has lately (<title>Gesch. und Topogr. der Stadt Rom im Alterthum</title>, 2 vols. 1883, 1885) advocated, with much ingenuity and learning, a theory that the curiae were based originally upon the gradual occupation of the seven hills of the Septimontium by tribes of different origin, and their ultimate federation.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosscuria">Curia</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">βουλευτήριον</foreign>) is also used to designate the place in which the Senate held its meetings. From this there gradually arose the custom of calling the Senate itself <seg lang="la">curia</seg> in the coloniae and municipia, but never the Senate of Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecurio">Decurio</ref>). The official residence of the Salii, which was dedicated to Mars, was likewise styled <seg lang="la">curia</seg> ( <title>De Div.</title> i. 17; <bibl n="Dionys.  14. 5" default="NO">Dionys.xiv. 5</bibl>; <title>Camill.</title> 32).</p>
 <p>The history and site of the Senate-house at Rome have been much discussed. Built by Tullus Hostilius (Varr. <title>L.

 <p>A Roman, celebrated for his warlike achievements, and also for the primitive simplicity of his manners. In his first consulship (B.C. 290) he triumphed twice, once over the Samnites and then over the Sabines, and in this same year also he obtained an ovation for his successes against the Lucanians. He afterwards (B.C. 275), in his third consulship, triumphed over Pyrrhus and the Samnites. It was on this occasion that the Roman people first saw elephants led along in triumph ( <bibl n="Flor.  1. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.i. 18</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>viii. 6</bibl>; Eutrop. ii. 14), and it was this victory that drove Pyrrhus from Italy. The simple manners of this distinguished man are often referred to by the Roman writers. When the ambassadors of the Samnites visited his cottage, they found him, according to one account, sitting on a bench by the fireside, <cb /> and eating out of a wooden bowl (Val. Max. iv. 3, 5), and, according to Plutarch, boiling turnips. On their attempting to bribe him with a large sum of gold, he at once rejected their offer, exclaiming that a man who could be content to live as they saw him living had no need whatever of gold, and that he thought it more glorious to conquer the possessors of it than to possess it himself. His scanty farm and humble cottage, moreover, were in full accordance with the idea which Curius had formed of private wealth; for, after so many achievements and honours, he declared that citizen a pernicious one who did not find seven acres (<seg lang="la">iugera</seg>) sufficient for his subsistence ( <bibl n="Plin.  18. 3" default="NO">Plin.xviii. 3</bibl>).

<div2 id="crosscurrus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Currus">Currus</head>

 <p> dim. <hi rend="bold">Curricŭlum</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἅρμα</foreign>). A chariot, a car. These terms appear to have denoted those two-wheeled vehicles for the carriage of persons which were open overhead, thus differing from the <seg lang="la">carpentum</seg> (q. v.), and closed in front, in which they differed from the <seg lang="la">cisium</seg> (q. v.). One of the most essential parts in the construction of the currus was the <foreign lang="greek">ἄντυξ</foreign>, or rim; and it is accordingly seen in all the chariots which are represented in this article. Another indispensable part was the axle, made of oak (<foreign lang="greek">φήγινος ἄξων</foreign>), and sometimes also of ilex, ash, or elm. The cars of Heré and Poseidon have metallic axles. One method of making a chariot less liable to be overturned was to lengthen its axle, and thus to widen the base on which it stood. The axle was firmly fixed under the body of the chariot, which, in reference to this circumstance, was called <foreign lang="greek">ὑπερτερία</foreign>, and which was often made of wicker-work, enclosed by the <foreign lang="greek">ἄντυξ</foreign>. Fat (<foreign lang="greek">λίπος</foreign>) and pressed olives (<seg lang="la">amurca</seg>) were used to grease the axle.</p>
 <p>The wheels (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλα, τροχοί</foreign>, <seg lang="la">rotae</seg>) revolved upon the axle, as in modern carriages; and they were prevented from coming off by the insertion of pins (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμβολοι</foreign>) into the extremities of the axle (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκραξονία</foreign>). Pelops obtained his celebrated victory over Oenomaüs through the artifice of Hippodamia, who, wishing to marry Pelops, persuaded Myrtilus, the charioteer of his adversary, to omit inserting one of the linchpins in the axle of his car, or to insert one of wax. She thus caused the overthrow and death of her father, Oenomaüs, and then married the conqueror in the race.</p>
 <p>Sir W. Gell describes, in the following terms, the wheels of three cars which were found at Pompeii: “The wheels light, and dished much like the modern, 4 feet 3 inches diameter, 10 spokes, a little thicker at each end.” These cars were probably intended for the purposes of common life. From Xenophon we learn that the wheels were made stronger when they were intended for the field of battle. After each excursion the wheels were taken off the chariot, which was laid on a shelf or reared against a wall, and they were put on again whenever it was wanted for use.</p>
 <p>The parts of the wheel were as follows:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The nave or hub, called <foreign lang="greek">πλήμνη, χοινικίς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">modiolus.</seg> The last two terms are founded on the resemblance of the nave to a modius or bushel. 
<pb n="444" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The nave was strengthened by being bound with an iron ring, called <foreign lang="greek">πλημνόδετον</foreign>.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The spokes, <foreign lang="greek">κνῆμαι</foreign> (literally, “the legs”), <seg lang="la">radii.</seg> We have seen that the spokes were sometimes ten in number. In other instances they were eight (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλα ὀκτάκνημα</foreign>), six, or four. Instead of being of wood, the spokes of the chariot of the Sun, constructed by Hephaestus, were of silver (<seg lang="la">radiorum argenteus ordo</seg>).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The felly, <foreign lang="greek">ἴτυς</foreign>. This was commonly made of some flexible and elastic wood, such as poplar or the wild fig, which was also used for the rim of the chariot; heat was applied to assist in producing the requisite curvature. The felly was, however, composed of separate pieces, called arcs (<foreign lang="greek">ἁψῖδες</foreign>). Hence the observation of Plutarch that, as a “wheel revolves, first one <hi rend="italic">apsis</hi> is at the highest point, and then another.” Hesiod evidently intended to recommend that a wheel should consist of four pieces.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The tire, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίσωτρον</foreign>, <seg lang="la">canthus.</seg> Homer describes the chariot of Heré as having a tire of bronze upon a golden felly, thus placing the harder metal in a position to resist friction and to protect the softer. The tire was commonly of iron.</p>
 <p>All the parts now enumerated are seen in an ancient chariot preserved in the Vatican, a representation of which is given in the following illustration. <figure id="fig.00444">
<head orig="Currus. (Vatican.)">Currus. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>This chariot, which is in some parts restored, also shows the pole (<foreign lang="greek">ῥυμός</foreign>, <seg lang="la">temo</seg>). It was firmly fixed at its lower extremity to the axle, whence the destruction of Phaëthon's chariot is represented by the circumstance of the pole and axle being torn asunder (<seg lang="la">temone revulsus axis</seg>). At the other end (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκρορρύμιον</foreign>) the pole was attached to the yoke, either by a pin (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμβολος</foreign>), as shown in the chariot above engraved, or by the use of ropes and bands. See <ref type="cross" target="crossiugum">Iugum</ref>.</p>
 <p>Carriages with two, or even three, poles were used by the Lydians. The Greeks and Romans, on the other hand, appear never to have used more than one pole and one yoke, and the currus thus constructed was commonly drawn by two horses, which were attached to it by their necks, and therefore called <foreign lang="greek">δίζυγες ἵπποι, συνωρίς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">gemini iugales, equi biiuges.</seg></p>
 <p>If a third horse was added, as was not unfrequently the case, it was fastened by traces. It may have been intended to take the place of either <cb /> of the yoke-horses (<foreign lang="greek">ζύγιοι ἵπποι</foreign>) which might happen to be disabled. The horse so attached was called <foreign lang="greek">παρήορος</foreign>. When Patroclus returned to battle in the chariot of Achilles, two immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, were placed under the yoke; a third, called Pedasus, and mortal, was added on the right hand; and, having been slain, caused confusion, until the driver cut the harness by which this third horse was fastened to the chariot. <figure id="fig.00444.2">
<head orig="Currus with Three Horses. (Ginzrot.)">Currus with Three Horses. (Ginzrot.)</head>
</figure> Ginzrot has published two drawings of chariots with three horses from Etruscan vases in the collection at Vienna. The <foreign lang="greek">ἵππος παρήορος</foreign> is placed on the right of the two yoke-horses. We also observe traces passing between the two <foreign lang="greek">ἄντυγες</foreign>, and proceeding from the front of the chariot on each side of the middle horse. These probably assisted in attaching the third or extra horse.</p>
 <p>The Latin name for a chariot and pair was <seg lang="la">biga.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbiga">Biga</ref>.) When a third horse was added, it was called <seg lang="la">triga;</seg> and, by the same analogy, a chariot and four was called <hi rend="italic">quadriga;</hi> in Greek, <foreign lang="greek">τετραορία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τέθριππος</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The horses were commonly harnessed in a quadriga after the manner already represented, the two strongest horses being placed under the yoke, and the two others fastened on each side by means of ropes. This is implied in the use of the epithets <foreign lang="greek">σειραῖος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σειραφόρος</foreign>, and <seg lang="la">funalis</seg> or <seg lang="la">funarius</seg>, for a horse so attached. The two exterior horses were further distinguished from one another as the right and the left trace-horse. In a chariot-race described by Sophocles, the driver, aiming to pass the goal, which is on his left hand, restrains the nearest horse, and gives the reins to that which was farthest from it—viz., the horse in traces on the right hand (<foreign lang="greek">δεξιὸν δ ἀνεὶς σειραῖον ἵππον</foreign>). In the splendid triumph of Augustus after the battle of Actium, the trace-horses of his car were ridden by two of his young relations. Tiberius rode, as Suetonius relates, <seg lang="la">sinisteriore funali equo</seg>, and Marcellus <seg lang="la">dexteriore funali equo.</seg> As the works of ancient art, especially fictile vases, abound in representations of quadrigae, numerous instances may be observed in which the two middle horses (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ μέσος δεξιὸς καὶ ὁ μέσος ἀριστερός</foreign>) are yoked together as in a biga; and, as the two lateral ones have collars (<foreign lang="greek">λέπαδνα</foreign>) equally with the yoke-horses, we may presume that from the top of these proceeded the ropes which were tied to the rim of the car, and by which the trace-horses assisted to draw it. The first figure in the following illustration is the chariot of Aurora, as painted on a vase found at Canosa. The reins of the two middle horses pass through rings at the extremities of the yoke. All the particulars which have been mentioned are still more distinctly seen in the second figure, taken from a terra-cotta at Vienna. It represents a chariot overthrown in passing the goal at the circus. 
<pb n="445" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The charioteer having fallen backwards, the pole and yoke are thrown upwards into the air; the two trace-horses have fallen on their knees, and the two yoke-horses are prancing on their hind-legs.</p>
 <p>If we may rely on the evidence of numerous works of art, the currus was sometimes drawn by four horses without either yoke or pole; for we <figure id="fig.00445">
<head orig="Currus with Four Horses.">Currus with Four Horses.</head>
</figure> see two of them diverging to the right hand and two to the left, as in the beautiful cameo given below, which represents Apollo surrounded by the signs of the zodiac. If the ancients really drove the quadriga thus harnessed, we can only suppose the charioteer to have checked its speed by pulling up the horses and leaning with his whole body backwards, so as to make the bottom of the car at its hindermost border scrape the ground—an act and an attitude which seem not unfrequently to be intended in antique representations.</p>
 <p>The currus, like the <seg lang="la">cisium</seg>, was adapted to carry two persons, and on this account was called in Greek <foreign lang="greek">δίφρος</foreign>. One of the two was, of course, the driver. He was called <foreign lang="greek">ἡνίοχος</foreign>, because he held the reins, and his companion <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign>, from going by his side or near him. Though in all respects superior, the <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign> was often obliged to place himself <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">ἡνίοχος</foreign>. He is so represented in the <seg lang="la">biga</seg> at page 92, and in the <title>Iliad</title> Achilles himself stands behind his charioteer Automedon. <figure id="fig.00445.2">
<head orig="Four-horse Chariots on Gems. (Berlin Museum.)">Four-horse Chariots on Gems. (Berlin Museum.)</head>
</figure> On the other hand, a personage of the highest rank may drive his own carriage, and then an inferior may be his <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign>, as when Nestor conveys Machaon (<foreign lang="greek">πάῤ δὲ Μαχάων βαῖνε</foreign>), and Heré, holding the reins and whip, conveys Athené, who is in full armour. In such cases a kindness, or even a compliment, was conferred by the driver upon him whom he conveyed, as when Dionysius, tyrant of Sicily, “himself holding the reins, made Plato his <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign>.” In the contest which has been already referred to, and which was so celebrated in Greek mythology, Oenomaüs intrusts the reins to the unfaithful Myrtilus, and assumes the place of his <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign>, while Pelops himself drives with Hippodamia as his <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτις</foreign>, thus honouring her in return for the service she had bestowed. <cb /></p>
 <p>The Persepolitan sculptures, and the innumerable paintings discovered in Egyptian tombs, concur with the historical writings of the Old Testament, and with the testimony of other ancient authors, in showing how commonly chariots were employed on the field of battle by the Egyptians, the Persians, and other Asiatic nations. The Greek poetry of the Heroic Ages proves with equal certainty the early prevalence of the same custom in Greece. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀριστῆες</foreign>—i. e. the nobility, or men of rank — who wore complete suits of armour, all took their chariots with them, and in an engagement placed themselves in front. Such were the <foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign>, or cavalry of the Homeric period—the precursors of those who, after some centuries, adopted the less expensive and ostentatious practice of riding on horseback, but who, nevertheless, in consideration of their wealth and station, still maintained their own horses, rather to aid and exhibit themselves individually on the field than to act as members of a compact body. In Homer's battles we find that the horseman—who, for the purpose of using his weapons and in consequence of the weight of his armour, is under the necessity of taking the place of <foreign lang="greek">παραιβάτης</foreign>—often assails or challenges a distant foe from the chariot; but that, when he encounters his adversary in close combat, they both dismount, “springing from their chariots to the ground,” and leaving them to the care of the <foreign lang="greek">ἡνίοχοι</foreign>. So likewise Turnus is described by Vergil, <title>Desiluit Turnus biiugis; pedes apparat ire Comminus.</title> As soon as the hero had finished the trial of his strength with his opponent, he returned to his chariot, one of the chief uses of which was to rescue him from danger. When Automedon prepares to encounter both Hector and Aeneas, justly fearing the result, he directs his charioteer, Alcimedon, instead of driving the horses to any distance, to keep them “breathing on his back,” and thus to enable him to effect his escape in case of need.</p>
 <p>These chariots, as represented on bas-reliefs and fictile vases, were exceedingly light, the body often consisting of little besides a rim fastened to the bottom and to the axle. Unless such had been really their construction, it would be difficult to imagine how so great a multitude of chariots could have been transported across the Aegean Sea. The light and simple construction of war-chariots is also supposed by Vergil, when he represents them as suspended with all kinds of armour on the entrance to the temple of the Laurentian Picus.</p>
 <p>We have already seen that it was not unusual in the Homeric battles to drive three horses, one being a <foreign lang="greek">παρήορος</foreign>; in a single instance, that of Hector, four are driven together. In the games, the use of this number of horses was, perhaps, even more common than the use of two. The form of the chariot was the same, except that it was more elegantly decorated. But the highest style of ornament was reserved to be displayed in the quadrigae 
<pb n="446" /><cb /> in which the Roman generals and emperors rode when they triumphed. The body of the triumphal car was cylindrical, as we often see it represented on medals. It was enriched with gold (<seg lang="la">aureus currus</seg>) and ivory. The utmost skill of the painter and the sculptor was employed to enhance its beauty and splendour. More particularly the extremities of the axle, of the pole, and of the yoke were highly wrought in the form of animals' heads. Wreaths of laurel were sometimes hung round it (<seg lang="la">currus lauriger</seg>), and were also fixed to the heads of the four snow-white horses. The car was elevated so that he who triumphed might be the most conspicuous person in the procession, and, for the same reason, he was obliged to stand erect (<seg lang="la">in curru stantis eburno</seg>). A friend, more especially a son, was sometimes carried in the same chariot by his side. When Germanicus celebrated his triumph, the car was “loaded” with five of his children in addition to himself. The triumphal car had, in general, no pole, the horses being led by men who were stationed at their heads.</p>
 <p>The chariot was an attribute not only of the gods, but of various imaginary beings, such as Victory, often so represented on coins, vases, and sculptures; Night; and Aurora, whom Vergil represents as driving either two horses or four, in this agreeing with the figure in the illustrations on p. 445. In general, the poets are more specific as to the number of horses in the chariots of the deities, and it rarely exceeded two. Iupiter, as the father of the gods, drives four white horses when he goes armed with his thunderbolt to resist the giants; Pluto is drawn by four black horses.</p>
 <p>The chariots of Iupiter and of the Sun are, moreover, painted on ancient vases with wings proceeding from the extremities of the axle (<foreign lang="greek">πτηνὸν ἅρμα</foreign>; <seg lang="la">volucrem currum</seg>).</p>
 <p>These supernatural chariots were drawn not only by horses, but by a great variety of brute or imaginary beings. Thus Medea received from the Sun a car with winged dragons. Iuno is drawn by peacocks, Diana by stags, Venus by doves or swans, Minerva by owls, Mercury by rams, and Apollo by griffins. To the car of Bacchus, and consequently of Ariadné, are yoked centaurs, tigers, and lynxes.</p>
 <p>Chariots executed in terra-cotta (<seg lang="la">quadrigae fictiles</seg>), in bronze, or in marble, an example of which last is shown in the annexed illustration from an <figure id="fig.00446">

 <p>No pains were spared in their decoration, and Pliny informs us that some of the most eminent <cb /> artists were employed upon them. In numerous instances they were designed to perpetuate the fame of those who had conquered in the chariotrace. As the emblem of victory, the <hi rend="italic">quadriga</hi> was sometimes adopted by the Romans to grace the triumphal arch by being placed on its summit; and even in the private houses of great families, chariots were displayed as the indications of rank or the memorials of conquest and of triumph.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δρόμος, τρόχος</foreign>). Foot-racing. In historic times, at the national festivals of Greece, several species of it had come into vogue. We may distinguish four sorts: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign> (or simply <foreign lang="greek">δρόμος</foreign>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the <foreign lang="greek">ἐφίππιος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἵππιος δρόμος</foreign>; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the <foreign lang="greek">δολιχὸς δρόμος</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">δόλιχος</foreign>, proparox). A strange feature in these races was that they were not run on hard and firm ground (Lucian, <title>Anachars.</title> 27), but over a deeply sanded surface.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign> was a race in which the runners (<foreign lang="greek">σταδιοδρόμοι</foreign>) traversed the arena in a direct line (whence it was called <foreign lang="greek">εὐθύς, ἄκαμπτος</foreign>) from one extremity to the other. This distance, as measured by the Olympic stadium, which became the general standard, was about 600 feet. The <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign> corresponds to our “sprint,” in which the runner does the whole run at his highest speed.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>, or double course (properly= double pipe), required that the runners (<foreign lang="greek">διαυλοδρόμοι</foreign>) should, after traversing the arena as in the <foreign lang="greek">στάδιον</foreign>, turn round a post (<foreign lang="greek">καμπτήρ</foreign>) and run back to their starting-point. Hence it was called <foreign lang="greek">δρόμος κάμπειος</foreign> (from <foreign lang="greek">καμπή</foreign>=<seg lang="la">flexus</seg>).</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <foreign lang="greek">ἐφίππιος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἵππιος</foreign> did not, as might seem from its name, signify a horse-race, but a race of sufficient length to try the power of a horse. (See Hermann-Blümner, <title>Privatalt.</title> p. 346.) It was a test therefore of endurance as well as speed, being four stadia in length; that is, twice the <foreign lang="greek">δίαυλος</foreign>.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The true test of staying power, however, was the <foreign lang="greek">δόλιχος</foreign> or long race, added to the Olympic Games (according to Philostratus, <title>Gymn.</title> 12) in <bibl n="Olymp.  15." default="NO">Olymp.15.</bibl>The length of this race has been variously described as seven, twelve, twenty, or twentyfour stadia. We may suppose that it differed on different occasions.</p>
 <p>Competition in foot-racing was open to runners of all ages, whether boys (<foreign lang="greek">παῖδες</foreign>), striplings (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγένειοι</foreign>), or grown men (<foreign lang="greek">ἄνδρες</foreign>). Only those who belonged to the same class, as regards age (<foreign lang="greek">ἡλικιῶται</foreign>), were permitted to compete with one another; seniors, of course, not being allowed to enter against their juniors. In Sparta even girls ran.</p>
 <p>The competitors, being too numerous to contend all together, were entered in successive groups (<foreign lang="greek">τάξεις</foreign>); those who should form each group, as 
<pb n="447" /><cb />
 well as the order in which the groups should run, being determined by lot (<foreign lang="greek">συνταχθῆναι ὑπὸ τοῦ κλήρου</foreign>). When all the <foreign lang="greek">τάξεις</foreign> in turn had run, the victors in each were formed into one group, which ran a final heat for the prize.</p>
 <p>It is doubtless owing to their want of instruments for accurately measuring small portions of time that the Greeks have left us scarcely any means of computing the speed which foot-racers attained in the various kinds of running.</p>
 <p>For some special forms of the foot-race, see <ref type="cross" target="crosslampadedromia">Lampadedromia</ref> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Staphylodromia</hi>.</p>
 <p>We have very meagre information regarding foot-racing as practised by the Romans. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (vii. 71, 73), it formed part of the Ludi Magni from the time of their institution. He, too, tells us that the runners wore the <seg lang="la">subligaculum</seg> round their loins. In the Capitoline Games (Dio Cass. lxvii. 8) young women, after the Spartan fashion, took part in the competition. Beyond these scanty notices and vague references to running for healthful exercise in the Campus Martius, very little has been handed down to us. This running in the Campus was not always competitive. That it was sometimes so, however, is plain from Martial, iv. 19.

<head orig="Cursus Publĭcus">Cursus Publicus</head>

 <p> The postal-service of the Roman Empire.</p>
 <p>Persia under Darius, son of Hystaspes, affords the earliest instance of a national postal-service. Mention is indeed made (<title>Liberat. Brev.</title> 23) of a class called <hi rend="italic">symmaci</hi> as existing in the most ancient times among the Egyptians for the conveyance of letters by land, but we have no grounds for thinking that a postal-system was established in Egypt as a branch of the administration. In the Persian dominions, however, as we learn from Herodotus (iii. 28; vi. 105; viii. 98), horsemen, stationed at intervals and relieving one another, conveyed the imperial will in all directions from Susa, Ecbatana, or Babylon. The service was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀγγαρήϊον</foreign>, and the couriers, <foreign lang="greek">ἄγγαροι</foreign>. Messages of lesser urgency were carried by <foreign lang="greek">ἡμεροδρόμοι</foreign>. In Greece there are no evidences of any such service, at least upon a similar scale, for the <seg lang="la">hemerodromi</seg> mentioned by Corn. Nepos ( <bibl n="Nep. Milt. 4. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Milt.</title>iv. 3</bibl>) can scarcely have been a permanent institution. This was probably due to the geographical smallness of Greece; still more, however, to the utter absence of political unity among the Greeks, and the want of facilities for land traffic, in contrast with the easy communications by sea. But the vast extent of the Roman dominions, and the centralization of imperial functions in a single hand, again furnished the conditions of a postal-service, which accordingly arose and became a most important instrument of State administration. The practical wisdom of the Romans had from the beginning of their conquests taught them to make roads throughout the territories which they subdued, whence resulted a system of highways connecting the remotest parts of the Empire with Rome. These not only facilitated the marching of troops, but served the general purposes of transport and the conveyance of intelligence, forming, as they did, the material <seg lang="la">condicio sine qua non</seg> of the future <seg lang="la">cursus publicus.</seg> Within the last century of the Republic, also, certain practices had already been established, by which the development of the postal-service was largely conditioned. We now proceed to give some account of these.<cb /></p>
 <p>Under the Republic, after the conquest of Italy, government officials despatched from Rome on public business were empowered to impose arbitrary requisitions on the subject Italians (<seg lang="la">dediticii</seg>) to supply them with necessaries for travelling. Among the Italian allies such functionaries usually obtained food, lodging, and means of transport from their guest-friends or from the principal personages in the friendly States which they visited. But when the Roman dominions included extra-Italian provinces, the fine distinction made in Italy between subjects and allies (<seg lang="la">socii</seg>) was in the provinces neglected, and the provincial allies were as summarily requisitioned by a <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> as were the provincial subjects. Senators or citizens employed on a public mission abroad received from the Senate a mandate (<seg lang="la">diploma</seg>) requiring subjects and allies alike to supply them with means of transport and other necessaries at all the successive stages of their journey. This in the natural course of things led to grave hardships, and complaints frequently arose. Restrictive enactments became necessary; and we read that Cato the Elder, when praetor in Sardinia, diminished or removed the expenses entailed upon the people of that island by the entertainment of the praetors officiating among them ( <bibl n="Liv.  32. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxii. 27</bibl>). It is doubtful, however, whether Cato issued a formal edict, or whether his good example alone operated towards the relief of the sufferers.</p>
 <p>Among the various embassies which thus became grounds of hardship to the provincials there was one which deserves especial notice. This was called <seg lang="la">libera legatio</seg>, being a sort of mission from which all State employment was absent, granted as a favour sometimes to distinguished men, lasting for several years, and carrying with it all the previously mentioned liabilities on the part of the provincials. The <seg lang="la">libera legatio</seg>, owing to the indefiniteness of the privileges it conveyed, became a fearful cause of oppression. A law was carried in B.C. 63 by Cicero ( <title>De Leg.</title> iii. 8, 18) restricting abuses of the <seg lang="la">libera legatio</seg> and limiting its duration to one year; but the reform thus effected was short-lived, for Iulius Caesar ( <title>Ad Att.</title> xv. 11) again extended the term of a <seg lang="la">libera legatio</seg> to a possible five years.</p>
 <p>During the last period of the Republic the Senate had frequent occasions for communicating in despatches with their generals or provincial governors, as well as with allied kings and States. For the conveyance of such despatches the authorities employed freedmen, slaves, or a certain class of couriers called <seg lang="la">stratores</seg> (<seg lang="la">sternere</seg>, “to saddle”). A class of messengers also existed called <seg lang="la">tabellarii.</seg> For pressing messages a general usually employed mounted men detached from his own staff. The <seg lang="la">publicani</seg>, as especially interested in transmitting and receiving intelligence to and from Rome, had a special class of <seg lang="la">tabellarii</seg>, whose services, however, were often borrowed by the magistrates, or by the <seg lang="la">negotiatores</seg>, speculators in corn or money, who were in constant relations with the provincial governors and with the <seg lang="la">publicani.</seg> The ships of the allies also were employed for the use of magistrates engaged abroad on public business. Thus for the purposes of transport and the conveyance of intelligence the dealings of the home government with the provincials were regulated 
<pb n="448" /><cb />
 mainly by the principle that the incidental labour and expenses should be borne as far as possible by the latter, while the interests to be served were those of the government alone.</p>
 <p>It only remained for the Empire to organize and develop the system which had been established under the republican <hi rend="italic">régime.</hi> The immense advantages of such an organization as a portion of the imperial administration were sufficiently obvious. Augustus accordingly appointed mounted couriers (<seg lang="la">stratores</seg> or <seg lang="la">speculatores</seg>) to be employed along the principal roads ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 49" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>49</bibl>). This implies the institution of stations (<seg lang="la">mutationes</seg>), at which they should relieve one another. But as this arrangement provided only for the conveyance of intelligence, it required to be supplemented by a transport system for the conveyance of money or other valuables of considerable weight. The necessity of constructing postal-stations ensued. The stations were called <seg lang="la">mansiones</seg>, which, being intended for lodgings, as their name indicates, were furnished not only with a supply for the immediate wants of man and beast, but also with the accommodation suitable for travellers. The <seg lang="la">mansiones</seg> were not so numerous along a road as the <seg lang="la">mutationes</seg>, or changing-stages. In accordance with republican precedent the expenses of the transport and postal system generally continued to fall upon the communities through whose territories the lines of stations lay. They accordingly had to provide conductors, guards, drivers, together with beasts of burden and rolling-stock, on receipt of the emperor's order (<seg lang="la">diploma</seg>), or that of the head of the postal system (a functionary designated in Trajan's time as <seg lang="la">ab vehiculis</seg>), who was generally a freedman of the emperor. Such warrants for the use of the post were issued occasionally by the consul, by the praefect of the praetorians, or by the governor of a province, but in all cases only with the emperor's special authority. While the document entitling to the use of the <seg lang="la">cursus</seg>, by virtue of being stamped with the emperor's seal, was called <seg lang="la">diploma</seg> (and other names which will hereafter be referred to), the right of issuing postal-warrants was, at least until a late period, called <seg lang="la">evectio.</seg> The expenses, moreover, of constructing stations and stocking them with necessaries had to be borne by the neighbouring communities. Along the line of one day's journey there were six or eight sets of stables, each of which had to maintain a total of forty beasts, including horses, mules, asses, etc. The communities also were bound to furnish and maintain the teams and to keep the stables in repair; they had further to secure the services of muleteers (<seg lang="la">muliones</seg>), mule-doctors (<seg lang="la">mulomedici</seg>), wheelwrights (<seg lang="la">carpentarii</seg>), grooms (<seg lang="la">hippocomi</seg>), and conductors or guards (<seg lang="la">vehicularii</seg>). From these heavy burdens Nerva relieved the people of Italy, and to commemorate his act a medal was struck bearing the inscription <title>vehiculatione Italiae remissa</title> (where <seg lang="la">vehiculatio=cursus publicus</seg>). Trajan, however, re-authorized ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 10. 121" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>x. 121</bibl>) the issue of postal-warrants in Italy, but restricted them to cases in which he had been personally consulted. We read ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 7" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>7</bibl>) that Hadrian <seg lang="la">statum cursum fiscalem instituit, ne magistratus hoc onere gravarentur.</seg> According to Hirschfeld, in his note to these words, <seg lang="la">cursus fiscalis</seg> is in Spartianus equivalent to <seg lang="la">cursus vehicularius</seg>, and the emphasis lies upon the word <seg lang="la">statum.</seg> According to his view, <cb /> therefore, the meaning of the whole sentence is that Hadrian made the postal-service throughout the Empire a department of the State administration, and appointed fixed stations, superintended by government officials, in order to relieve the <hi rend="italic">municipal</hi> magistrates of all responsibility for them. Despite, however, these and other efforts in this direction, it was not until the time of Septimius Severus ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Sever. 14" default="NO">Spart. <title>Sever.</title>14</bibl>) that the expenses of the post generally were made chargeable to the imperial treasury. But, even when this had been done, the subjects still continued to suffer, nor did any subsequent legislation materially alleviate the burden with which the <seg lang="la">cursus</seg> pressed upon them. Differences of opinion exist as to the exact nature of the reforms or changes attributed respectively to Nerva , Trajan, and the others above mentioned. Humbert says we must at least suppose, as Hudemann does, that Nerva entirely remitted, though only to Italy, the expenses of the service, so that the salaries of officials engaged in it, as well as the material cost, became alike chargeable to the treasury; that Trajan contented himself with merely checking the abuse of <seg lang="la">evectio</seg>; while Hadrian, besides extending the organization of the post through the whole Empire, must apparently have imposed the charges of it upon the <seg lang="la">fiscus;</seg> that Antoninus Pius again, like Trajan, making a step backwards, confined the contemplated reform to a mere restriction of expenses and of the right of issuing post-warrants; that Septimius Severus completely reorganized the <seg lang="la">vehicularium munus</seg>, and imposed the charges of it, in Italy and the rest of the Empire alike, upon the <seg lang="la">fiscus</seg> alone; but that the last and radical reform was incapable of maintaining itself, owing to the burdens it entailed upon the treasury. Diocletian, Constantine, and their successors all strove to perfect the organization of the post, and to define exactly what the liabilities of the cities in regard to it should be, together with determining the question who should have the <seg lang="la">evectio</seg>, or right of granting postal permits, and under what circumstances they might be justly granted.</p>
 <p>In the later times of the Roman Empire the post became an ever-increasing burden to the cities; and as it injured them, in the same degree it prepared the way for its own ruin. Nevertheless a treaty ratified between Rome and Persia in A.D. 565 (Menander,  <title>Prot.</title>p. 360, ed. Bonn) assured to the natives of the frontier provinces of the two empires the uses of the postal-service to and fro between them.

 <p>One of the most distinguished classicists and philologists of the present century, born at Lübeck, April 16th, 1820. He pursued his studies at Bonn and Berlin, teaching for a time at the latter place and at Dresden. In 1849, he was made Professor Extraordinarius of Classical Philology at Prague, becoming in 1851 Professor Ordinarius. From Prague he was called in 1854 to a like chair at Kiel, and in 1862 to Leipzig. He died August 12th, 1885.</p>
 <p>Curtius was the last and one of the greatest of the “old school” of classical philologists, and formulated in their final expression their etymological views. He was also profoundly learned in Greek, and in this department wrote a number of standard works: the <bibl default="NO"><title>Griechische Schulgrammatik</title> (1852)</bibl>, which reached its fifteenth (German) edition in 1882, and

<div2 id="crosscurtius2" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Curtius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Mettus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman youth, who devoted himself, for his country, to the Manes, B.C. 362. According to the account given by Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 7.6" default="NO" valid="yes">vii. 6</bibl>), the ground near the middle of the Forum, in consequence either of an earthquake or some other violent cause, sank down to an immense depth, forming a vast aperture; nor could the gulf be filled up by all the earth which could be thrown into it. At last the soothsayers declared that, if the Romans wished the commonwealth to be everlasting, they must devote to this chasm what constituted the principal strength of the Roman people. Curtius, on hearing the answer, demanded of his countrymen whether they possessed anything so valuable as their arms and courage. They yielded a silent assent to the question put them; whereupon, having arrayed himself in full armour and mounted his horse, Curtius plunged into the chasm, and the people threw after him their offerings and quantities of the fruits of the earth. Valerius Maximus (v. 6, 2) states that the earth closed immediately over him. Livy , however, speaks of a lake occupying the spot, called Lacus Curtius. In another part of his history (i. 13), he mentions this same lake as existing in the time of Romulus, and as having derived its name from Mettus Curtius, a Sabine in the army of Titus Tatius. In all probability it was of volcanic origin, since the early accounts speak of its great depth, and was not produced merely by the inundations of the Tiber. Tarquinius Priscus is said to have filled up this lake at the time that he drained the whole of this district and constructed the Cloaca Maxima. Possibly he may have been aided in this by a natural tunnel gradually formed through the basin of the lake itself.

The ten books (<title>Historiarum Alexandri Magni Libri Decem</title>) that he wrote are believed to have been composed during the reign of Claudius on the strength of a passage in the work itself (x. 9, 3-6), which seems to refer to the outbreak at Rome on the death of Caligula, to which the accession of Claudius put an end.

 <p>The history of Alexander the Great is treated in a rhetorical fashion with little historical insight, introducing a number of picturesque details which are grouped effectively; and the career of the great Macedonian is regarded as a series of brilliant and romantic adventures.

<head orig="Cyaneae">Cyaneae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυάνεαι</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">νῆσοι</foreign>). Two small rugged islands at the entrance of the Euxine Sea, and forty stadia from the mouth of the Thracian Bosporus. According to Strabo, one was near the European the other near the Asiatic side, and the space between them was about twenty stadia. There was an ancient fable relative to these islands, that they floated about, and united to crush to pieces vessels which attempted to pass through the straits (Pomp. Mela, ii. 7). Pliny gives the same fable, but assigns, at the same time, the true cause of the legend. It arose from their appearing, like all other objects, to move towards or from each other when seen from a vessel in motion itself. The Argo, we are told by Apollonius Rhodius (<bibl n="A. R. 2.601" default="NO" valid="yes">ii. 601</bibl>), had a narrow escape in passing through, and lost the extremity of her stern. Pindar says that they were alive and moved to and fro more swiftly than the blasts, until the expedition of the Argonauts brought death upon them (Pyth. iv. 371 foll.). On which passage the scholiast remarks in explanation that it was decreed by the Fates they should become “rooted to the deep” whenever a vessel succeeded in passing through them—a prediction accomplished by the Argo. Phineus had directed Iason and his companions to let fly a pigeon when they were near these islands, telling them that if the bird came safely through the Argo might venture to follow her. They obeyed the directions of the prophet-prince; the pigeon passed through safely with the loss of its tail; and then the Argonauts, watching the recession of the rocks and aided by Heré and Athené, rowed vigorously on and passed through with the loss of a part of the rudder of their vessel.

 <p>The term “Cyaneae” (<foreign lang="greek">Κυάνεαι</foreign>), i. e. “dark blue” or “azure,” is referred by the scholiasts on Euripides ( <bibl n="Eur. Med. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Med.</title>2</bibl>) to the colour of these rocks. In the description of Homer, however, as will be seen presently, a more poetic turn is given to the appellation. To the name Cyaneae is frequently joined that of “Symplegades” (<foreign lang="greek">Συμπληγάδες</foreign>), i. e. “the Dashers,” in allusion to their supposed collision when vessels attempted to pass through. Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 12. 61" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xii. 61</bibl>) calls them <foreign lang="greek">Πλαγκταί</foreign>, “Wanderers.”

<head orig="Cyaxăres">Cyaxares</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυαξάρης</foreign>). (1) A king of the Medes, grandson of Deioces, son of Phraortes, and father of Astyages. He was a prince of violent character, and this trait displayed itself in his treatment of the Scythians, a body of whom had taken refuge in his territories in consequence of a sedition. He received them kindly, allowed them settlements, and even went so far as to intrust some children to their care, in order to have them taught the Scythian language and a knowledge of archery. After some time had elapsed, the Scythians, accustomed to go forth to the chase, and to bring back to the king some of the game obtained by the hunt, returned one day with empty hands. Cyaxares gave vent to his temper by punishing them severely. The Scythians, indignant at this treatment, which they knew to be unmerited, resolved to slay one of the children confided to their care, and, after preparing the flesh like the game they had been accustomed to bring, to serve it up before Cyaxares, and betake themselves immediately to Alyattes at Sardis ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 73</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  74" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 74</bibl>). This cruel revenge succeeded but too well. Cyaxares demanded the fugitives from King Alyattes, and on his refusal a war ensued. This war lasted for five years; in the sixth, an eclipse of the sun, which had been predicted by Thales, separated the contending armies (B.C. 610). Peace was soon restored through the mediation of Labynetus, king of Babylon, and Syennesis, king of Cilicia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 73</bibl> foll.). Herodotus also informs us (i. 103) that Cyaxares was the first who regularly trained the Asiatics to military service; dividing the troops, which had been imbodied promiscuously before his time, into distinct companies of lancers, archers, and cavalry. The historian then adds parenthetically, “this was he who waged war with the Lydians; when, during a battle, the day became night.” This parenthetical remark evidently refers to the foregoing account of the eclipse. We are next informed that, having subdued all Asia above the river Halys, he marched with all that were under his command against Nineveh, resolving to avenge the death of his father by the destruction of that city. After he had defeated the Assyrians he laid siege to the city, but was forced to raise it by a sudden invasion of his territories. For a numerous army of Scythians, headed by Madyas, made an irruption into Media, defeated him in a pitched battle, and brought both him and all Upper Asia under 
<pb n="451" /><cb />
 subjection to them for eight-and-twenty years ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 103" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 103</bibl> foll.). Then, in revenge for their galling impositions and exactions, he slew their chieftains, when intoxicated, at a banquet to which he had invited them; and, expelling the rest, recovered his former power and possessions. After this, the Medes took Nineveh and subdued the Assyrian provinces, all except the Babylonians, their confederates in the war. Cyaxares died after having reigned forty years (B.C. 634-594), including twenty-eight years of the Scythian dominion.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of Astyages, succeeding his father at the age of forty-nine years. Being naturally of an easy, indolent disposition and fond of his amusements, he left the burden of military affairs and the care of the government to Cyrus, his nephew and sonin-law, who married his only daughter, and was, therefore, doubly entitled to succeed him.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυκλάδες</foreign>). A name applied by the ancient Greeks to that cluster (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>) of islands which encircled Delos. Strabo says that the Cyclades were at first only twelve in number, but were afterwards increased to fifteen. These, as we learn from Artemidorus, were Ceos, Cythnos, Seriphos, Melos, Siphnos, Cimolos, Prepesinthos, Olearos, Paros, Naxos, Syros, Myconos, Tenos, Andros, and Gyaros, which last, however, Strabo himself was desirous of excluding, from its being a mere rock, as also Prepesinthos and Olearos.</p>
 <p>It appears from the Greek historians that the Cyclades were first inhabited by the Phoenicians, Carians, and Leleges, whose piratical habits rendered them formidable to the cities on the continent till they were conquered and finally extirpated by Minos ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 4</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 171" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 171</bibl>).

<head orig="Cyclic Poets">Cyclic Poets</head>

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Cyclĭ Poētae</hi>). A name given by the ancient grammarians to a class of minor poets, who selected, for the subjects of their productions, events occurring as well during the Trojan War as before and after, and who, in treating of these subjects, confined themselves within a certain round or cycle (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">circulus</seg>) of fable. In order to understand the subject more fully, we must observe that there was both a Mythic and a Trojan cycle. The former of these embraced the whole series of fable, from the genealogies of the gods down to the time of the Trojan War; the latter comprised the fables that had reference to, or were in any way connected with, the Trojan War. Of the first class were Theogonies, Cosmogonies, Titanomachies, and the like; of the second, the poems of Arctinus, Lesches, Agias, Eugammon, Stasinus, and others. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshomeric-question">Homeric Question</ref>.) At a later period the term <hi rend="italic">cyclic</hi> was applied, as a mark of contempt, to two species of poems—one, where the poet confined himself to a trite and hackneyed <hi rend="italic">round</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>) of particulars (cf. Horace, <title>Ars Poet.</title> 132); the other, where, from an ignorance of the true nature of epic poetry, he indulged in an inordinate and tiresome amount of detail, going back to the remotest beginnings of a subject. The most celebrated of the Cyclic poems were the <title>Cypria</title> (q. v.), the <title>Aethiopis</title> (q. v.) of Arctinus, the <title>Little Iliad</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰλιὰς Μικρά</foreign>) of Pausanias, the <title>Nostoi</title> (q. v.) of Agias, the <title>Telegonia</title> of Eugammon, the <title>Batrachomyomachia</title> (q. v.), and the <title>Margites</title> (q. v.) of Pigres.

<div2 id="crosscyclopes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cyclōpes">Cyclopes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύκλωπες</foreign>). A fabulous race, of gigantic size, having but one eye, large and round, placed in the centre of their forehead, whence, according to the common account, their name was derived—from <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>, “a circular opening,” and <foreign lang="greek">ὤψ</foreign>, “an eye.” Homer makes Odysseus, after having left the country of the Lotus-eaters (Lotophagi), to have sailed on westward, and to have come to that of the Cyclopes, who are described by him as a rude and lawless race, who neither planted nor sowed, but whose land was so fertile as to produce of itself wheat, barley, and vines. They had no social institutions, neither assemblies nor laws, but dwelt separately, each in his cave, on the tops of lofty mountains, and each, without regard to others, governed his own wife and children. The adventure of Odysseus with Polyphemus, one of this race, will be found under the latter title. Nothing is said by Homer respecting the size of the Cyclopes in general, but every effort is made to give an exaggerated idea of that of Polyphemus. Hence some have imagined that, according to the Homeric idea, the Cyclopes were not in general of such huge dimensions or cannibal habits as the poet assigns to Polyphemus himself; for the latter does not appear to have been of the ordinary Cyclops-race, but the son of Poseidon and a seanymph; and he is also said to have been the 
<pb n="452" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00452">
<head orig="Section of the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae.">Section of the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae.</head>
</figure>
 strongest of the Cyclopes ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 1. 70" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>i. 70</bibl>). Later poets, however, lost no time in supplying whatever the fable wanted in this respect, and hence Vergil describes the whole race as of gigantic stature and compares them to so many tall forest-trees ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 3. 680" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>iii. 680</bibl>). It is not a little remarkable that neither in the description of the Cyclopes in general, nor of Polyphemus in particular, is there any notice taken of their being one-eyed; yet in the account of the blinding of the latter, it seems to be assumed as a thing well known. We may hence, perhaps, infer that Homer followed the usual derivation.</p>
 <p>Such is the Homeric account of the Cyclopes. In Hesiod, on the other hand (<title>Theog.</title> 139 foll.), we have what appears to be the earlier legend respecting these fabled beings, a circumstance which may tend to show that the <title>Odyssey</title> was composed by a poet later than Hesiod, and not by the author of the <title>Iliad.</title> In the <title>Theogony</title> of Hesiod the Cyclopes are only three in number—Brontes, Steropes, and Arges. They are the sons of Uranus and Gaea (Caelus and Terra), and their employment is to forge the thunderbolts for Zeus. They are said to be in every other respect like gods, excepting the one single eye in the middle of their foreheads, a circumstance from which Hesiod also, like Homer, deduces their general name (<title>Theog.</title> 144 foll.). In the individual names given by Hesiod we have evidently the germ of the whole fable. The Cyclopes are the energies of the sky—the thunder, the lightning, and the rapid march of the latter (Brontes, from <foreign lang="greek">βροντή</foreign>, “thunder”; Steropes, from <foreign lang="greek">στεροπή</foreign>, “the lightning”; Arges, from <figure id="fig.00452.2">
<head orig="Cyclopean Pyramid at Cenchreae.">Cyclopean Pyramid at Cenchreae.</head>
</figure> <foreign lang="greek">ἀργής</foreign>, “rapid”). In accordance with this idea the term <foreign lang="greek">Κύκλωψ</foreign> (<title>Cyclops</title>) itself may be regarded as a simple, not a compound term, of the same class with <foreign lang="greek">μώλωψ, Κέρκωψ, Κέκροψ, Πέλοψ</foreign>; and the word <foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign> being the root, we may make the Cyclopes to be “the Whirlers,” or, to designate them by a Latin name, <title>Volvuli.</title></p>
 <p>When the thunder, the lightning, and the flame had been converted by poetry into oneeyed giants, and localized in the neighbourhood of volcanoes, <cb /> it was an easy process to convert them into smiths, the assistants of Hephaestus (Callim. <title>H. in Artem.</title> 46 foll.;  <bibl n="Verg. G. 4. 173" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iv. 173</bibl>; <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 416" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>viii. 416</bibl> foll.). As they were now artists in one line, it gave no surprise to find them engaged in a task adapted to their huge strength—namely, that of rearing the massive walls of Tiryns, for which purpose they were brought by Proetus from Lycia (Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 955" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orest.</title>955</bibl>). Hence, too, the name “Cyclopean” is applied to this species of architecture, just as in Germany the remains of ancient Roman walls are popularly called “Riesenmauer” and “Tenfelsmauer.” One theory refers the name Cyclops to the circular buildings constructed by the Pelasgi, of which we have so remarkable a specimen in what is called the Treasury of Atreus, at Mycenae. From the form of these buildings, resembling within a hollow cone or beehive, and the round opening at the top, the individuals who constructed them are thought to have derived their appellation. (Cf. Gell's <title>Argolis</title>, p. 34.) Those who make them to have dwelt in Sicily blend an old tradition with one of more recent date. This last probably took its rise when Aetna and the Lipari Islands were assigned to Hephaestus, by the popular belief of the day, as his workshops; which could only have happened when Aetna had become better known, and Mount Moschylus, in the isle of Lemnos, had ceased to be volcanic.</p>
 <p>A few remarks may fittingly be added here on the subject of the Cyclopean architecture. This style of building is frequently alluded to by the ancient writers. In fact, every architectural work of extraordinary magnitude, to the execution of which human labour appeared inadequate, was ascribed to the Cyclopes (Eurip. <title>Iph. in Aul.</title> 534; id. <title>Herc. Fur.</title> 15; id. <title>Troad.</title> 108; <bibl n="Strab.  373" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.373</bibl>; <title>Herc. Fur.</title> 996;  <bibl n="Stat.  Theb. 4. 151" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Theb.</title>iv. 151</bibl>; Pausan. ii. 25). The general character of the Cyclopean style is immense blocks of stone, without cement, placed 
<pb n="453" /><cb />
 upon each other, sometimes irregularly and with smaller stones filling up the interstices, sometimes in regular and horizontal rows. The Cyclopean style is commonly divided into four eras. The first, or oldest, is that employed at Tiryns and Mycenae, consisting of blocks of various sizes, some of them very large, the interstices of which are, or were once, filled up with small stones. The second era is marked by polygonal stones, which nevertheless fit into each other with great nicety. Specimens exist at Delphi, Iulis, and at Cosa in Etruria. In this style there are no courses. The third era appears in the Phocian cities, and in some of Boeotia and Argolis. It is distinguished by the work being made in courses, and by the stones, though of unequal size, being of the same height. The fourth and youngest style presents horizontal courses of masonry, not always of the same height, but formed of stones which are all rectangular. This style is chiefly confined to Attica. The most reasonable opinion relative to the Cyclopean walls of antiquity is that which ascribes their erection to the ancient <ref type="cross" target="crosspelasgi">Pelasgi</ref> (q.v.). See Reber, <title>History of Ancient Art</title>, pp. 178-194 <bibl default="NO">(Eng. trans. N. Y. 1882)</bibl>; and W. Gell, <title>Walls of Ancient Greece.</title>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύκνος</foreign>, “Swan”). (1) The son of Ares and Pelopia, who threw himself in the way of Heracles in Trachis, when the hero was on his way to Ceyx. According to another story, Heracles was sent against Cycnus by Apollo, because he lay in wait for the processions on their road to Delphi. In the contest between them, as described by Hesiod in his <title>Shield of Heracles</title>, Ares stood by the side of his son, while Heracles was supported by Athené and his faithful Iolaüs. Heracles slew Cycnus and even wounded Ares, when the latter attempted to avenge the fall of his son. Cycnus was buried with all due honours by his father-inlaw Ceyx, but Apollo destroyed the tomb by an inundation of the river Anaurus. There was a son of Ares and Pyrené who bore the same name, and he too was said to have fallen in combat against Heracles. Ares attempted to avenge his son, when Zeus, by a flash of lightning, separated his angry children. After his death, so ran the story, Cycnus was changed by his father into a swan.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The son of Poseidon and Calycé. He was exposed by his mother on the sea-shore and found by some fishermen, who named him Cycnus because they saw a swan flying round him. He was invulnerable and of gigantic strength and stature; his head (or, according to another account, his whole body) was as white as snow. He became king of Colonae in the Troad, and was twice married. <cb /> A slanderous utterance of his second wife stung him to fury against the children of his first wife, so that he threw them into the sea in a chest. They were cast up alive on the island of Tenedos, where Tenes was king. At a later time Cycnus repented of his deed, sought for his son, and marched with him to the aid of the Trojans against the Greeks. They prevented the Greeks from landing; but both were at last slain by Achilles, who strangled the invulnerable Cycnus with his own helmetstrap. He was changed by Poseidon into a swan.

It happened that she and Acontius, a youth from the island of Ceos, who was in love with her, had come at the same time to a festival of Artemis at Delos. Cydippé was sitting in the temple of Artemis when Acontius threw at her feet an apple on which was written, “I swear by the sanctuary of Artemis that I will wed Acontius.” Cydippé took up the apple and read the words aloud, then threw it from her and took no notice of Acontius and his addresses. After this her father wished on several occasions to give her in marriage, but she always fell ill before the wedding. The father consulted the Delphic oracle, which revealed to him that the illness of his daughter was due to the wrath of Artemis, by whose shrine she had sworn and broken her oath.

<div2 id="crosscynici" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Cynĭci">Cynici</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυνικοί</foreign>). A name given to the followers of Antisthenes who founded a distinct school of philosophy at Athens about B.C. 380. Antisthenes had been a pupil of Socrates, and, like that philosopher, he taught that speculative philosophy was unprofitable, and should be supplanted by the practical ethical teaching whose end is a moral and tranquil life. In this respect the Cynic School was like the Stoic, but differed in defining virtue to be extreme simplicity in living. This simplicity the followers of Antisthenes pushed so far as to violate the most elementary notions of cleanliness and even decency, and to plunge into the most frantic excesses of austerity, wearing filthy clothing, eating raw meat, and treating all who approached them with insulting rudeness. Hence the name <foreign lang="greek">Κυνικοί</foreign>, “dog-like,” was applied to them in its literal meaning, from their snarling insolence, though the name probably originated from the Gymnasium <ref type="cross" target="crosscynosarges">Cynosarges</ref> (q.v.), in which Antisthenes first taught. The most famous of the Cynics, Diogenes of Sinopé, accepted the name <foreign lang="greek">Κύων</foreign> with a sort of pride, and was pleased to be styled “Diogenes the Dog,” saying, however, that he did not, like other dogs, bite his enemies, but only his friends and for their own good. Besides Antisthenes and Diogenes, the best known Cynics were Crates of Thebes ( <bibl n="Diog.  6. 86" default="NO">Diog. Laert.vi. 86</bibl>), Hipparchia and her brother Metrocles, Monimus of Syracuse, Menippus of Sinopé, whom Lucian describes as “one of the ancient dogs who barks a great deal” (<title>Bis Accus.</title> 33); and at Rome, Demetrius, the friend of Seneca, Oenomaüs of Gadara, and Demonax of Cyprus. Cynicism became ultimately merged in Stoicism.</p>

<head orig="Cyprus">Cyprus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύπρος</foreign>). A large island of the Mediterranean, south of Cilicia and west of Syria, identical, at least in part, with the Hebrew <title>Kittim</title>, which seems to be its oldest known name; but it appears to be sometimes included in the name Caphtor, a title that properly belongs to Crete with other islands and coast lands settled by the Caphtorim. Other ancient names of Cyprus, most of them poetical, are Aeria, Aerosa, Acamantis, Amathusia, Aphrodisia, Aphelia, Collinia, Cerastis, Cryptos, Meïnis, Ophiusa, Macaria, Paphos, Sphekeia. The derivation of the name is uncertain, but the principal authorities, ancient and modern, refer it to the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">kopher</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gopher</hi>, the name of a tree; sometimes, without adequate reason, connecting it with <seg lang="la">cupressus.</seg> Another derivation is from <hi rend="italic">cuprum</hi>, “copper,” formerly found in the island; but the <foreign lang="greek">χάλκος κύπριος</foreign> or <seg lang="la">aes cyprium</seg> probably took its name from the island, not the island from the metal.</p>
 <p>Cyprus is reckoned by Strabo (or Timaeus, whom he follows) to be the third in extent of the Mediterranean isles. Its shape was aptly compared by the ancients to the outspread skin of an ox, or to the fleece of a sheep. Its extreme length, from Cape Acamas (now Cape Arnaouti or Epiphanio) on the west to the promontory Dinaretum (now St. Andrea) on the east, is about 140 miles; its greatest breadth, from Crommyon (now Cormaciti) on the north to Cape Curias (now Cape Gatto), on the south, about 60; its width varying greatly, the long strip that ends at Dinaretum being very narrow and scarcely more than 10 miles across at any point. Off Dinaretum are several small islands called Kleides (Keys). The coast is provided with numerous bays; but the harbors are now mere roadsteads, though the remains of ancient artificial harbor moles are to be seen at several places (as New Paphos, Soli, etc.).</p>
 <p>From Crommyon to Dinaretum, along and quite near the coast, extends a mountainous chain, of which the highest peaks are Buffavento (3240 ft.), Pentedactylon (2480 ft.), and Elias (2810 ft.). The principal ranges, however, are in the west and southwest, the highest point being Mount Olympus (Trodos or Troödos<bibl n="Shak. Tro 6590" default="NO" valid="yes"> Tro, 6590</bibl> ft.), nearly midway between Curium on the south coast and Soli on the north, from the top of which a view of the whole island can be obtained. Next in height is Mount Adelphi (Maschera, 5380 ft.), a few miles to the east; still farther east, a hill (4370 ft.) whose ancient name is unknown; and still farther east again, Mount Santa Croce (Stavros, 2300 ft.). The chain extends nearly to Famagousta (Ammochostos, Constantia-Salamis), with frequent spurs to the shore; and spurs also extend from Olympus radially to the north, west, and south. Between the two ranges is a vast plain, now called the Messouria, whose principal river is the Pidias (Pidaeas), emptying into the sea near Salamis. The Messouria to-day is one vast grain-field, interspersed <figure id="fig.00456">
<head orig="Copper Proconsular Coin of Cyprus.">Copper Proconsular Coin of Cyprus.</head>
</figure> <cb /> with insignificant villages. The island formerly abounded in trees and timber, of which it is now mostly denuded, though the kharub, olive, fig, orange, date-palm, lemon, nectarines, apricots, etc., and others suited to the climate flourish. Wild grape-vines still grow to an immense size. Wine, of various sorts, is abundant; the best and most famous being the Commanderia wine, so named from its original producers, the Knights of St. John, at Colossi. Formerly Cyprus yielded to no region in fertility, producing an abundance of grain, wine, oil, and fruits. At the proper season the hills and uncultivated plains are carpeted with anemones, ranunculuses, crocuses, hyacinths, squills, and a great variety of other flowers, especially those with bulbous roots. One ancient epithet of Cyprus is <foreign lang="greek">εὐώδης</foreign>. But agriculture, along with irrigation and drainage, is much neglected. Salt lakes, or “Salines,” exist near Larnaca, the ancient Citium, furnishing now, as in the times of Pliny , vast supplies of salt for home consumption and exportation, the salt coating the surface as the summer heat evaporates the water. The climate is still that of the ancient <seg lang="la">nimio calore.</seg></p>
 <p>Although the names of special historians have come down to us, we possess no ancient special treatise or history of the island, but are dependent for information anciently current upon the frequent mention in the Greek and Roman classics, with brief notices in the later historians. These are best collected in Engel's monograph <bibl default="NO"><title>Kypros</title> (Berlin, 1841)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The earliest inhabitants have generally been supposed to be Phoenicians, and it is true that the Phoenician language retained its hold in certain parts of Cyprus as late as anywhere, contemporarily, of course, with the Greek, the Lycian (locally), and later with the Latin. The Cypriotes, however, spoke a language peculiar to themselves, as was long ago evident from the scattered glosses preserved by the grammarians and lexicographers, and as has lately been further and most conclusively shown by the recent discovery and decipherment of inscriptions in the peculiar Cypriote character. This language was essentially Greek; and the Greek of Cyprus to-day embraces many peculiarities of its own. The legendary hero of Cyprus was Cinyras, who is said to have come to the island at the time of the beginning of the Trojan War. Without going into the matter of the legend, it may be said that Greek inscriptions of the “Cinyradae” (the priestly caste of Old Paphos, etc.) have been found in the island within the last twenty years.</p>
 <p>The chief religion of the island was notoriously the worship of Venus; but with few exceptions (as e. g. Zeus Labranios, introduced near Amathus from Caria) the religion and deities were introduced from Phoenicia, and thus indirectly from the farther East—with, however, some Greek modification. Aphrodité, Apollo, Hercules, and other deities usually called Greek or Roman were thus introduced, the Greek and Phoenician names of some of them appearing now and then on the same bilingual inscription. Aphrodité had her epithet of “Paphian” not only at Paphos, where her rites included all the extravagancies of Mylitta at Babylon, but at the other seats of her worship—Golgos, Dali, Cerynia, etc. Apollo Hylates, who had a temple at Curium, is called by that name and also by his Phoenician name of Resheph Mical on a 
<pb n="457" /><cb />
 bilingual inscription found at Dali. A temple to Eshmunmelqarth (=Aesculapius-Hercules), a Phoenician deity much like the Greek Palaemon and the Roman Portumnus, near the Salines at Larnaca, has furnished a number of Phoenician inscriptions of the fourth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c.;</hi> while a temple to Artemis Paralia, close at hand, has furnished a few Greek inscriptions and an immense number of valuable terra-cotta remains. <figure id="fig.00457">

 <p>Aside from the mythical reign of Cinyras over the whole island, the territory, so far as we know, was broken up into a number of kingdoms, whose detailed history has well-nigh perished. A dynasty of Phoenician kings ruled over Citium, Idalium, and Tamassus in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Salamis, said to have been founded by Teucer, and by him named after his native city, had its own Greek kings at the same period. Paphos had its dynasty of the Cinyradae, who seem also to have extended their power over Amathus and certain other parts. Soli and Cythrea traced their origin to the Athenians; Lapethus and Cerynia to a Lacedaemonian colony under Praxander and an Achaean one under Cepheus; Curium to the Argives. A town Asiné, whose site is not known, is said to have been colonized by the Dryopians; Neo-Paphos by Agapenor. The promontory Acamas is said to have its name from the hero of the Trojan War. Old Paphos, Amathus, and Citium were founded by the Phoenicians; and of these, Citium (with Dali and Tamassus) seems to have retained its Phoenician character with less modification than the others. Carpassia seems also to have had a Phoenician origin. Articles of Phoenician manufacture—bronze, gold, silver, pottery, etc.—have been found in abundance all over the island. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00457.2"><head>Terra-cotta Vase from Citium, inscribed <title>Khthac.</title> (Di Cesnola.)</head></figure></p>
 <p>Aside from these scattered data, we know that Thothmes III. of Egypt <bibl default="NO">(cir. B.C. 1500)</bibl> conquered Cyprus; Belus of Tyre was at one time its master; ten kingdoms, including Soli, Chytri, Curium, Lapethus, Cerynia, Neo Paphos, Marium, Idalium, Citium, and Amathus, sent their submission to the Assyrian Esarhaddon (cir. B.C. 890); Sargon put the island to tribute (cir. B.C. 707); Apries (Pharaoh Hophra) of Egypt defeated some Cyprian monarchs near Citium, and returned home laden with their spoils; Amasis of Egypt overran the island and put it to tribute, but the Cyprian rulers joined Cambyses the Persian against the son of Amasis. The king of Amathus revolted from the Persians in the time of Darius, and the longest record extant in the Cypriote character commemorates one of the side issues of this struggle. In B.C. 477, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians conquered part of Cyprus from the Persians; and a war resulted in which the Greeks, with the Tyrians and Egyptians as allies, were on one side, and the Persians on the other. The power of Alexander the Great was both felt and helped in Cyprus, after which, under the Ptolemies, followed wars and doubtful sovereignty, till Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered the island (cir. B.C. 306). About B.C. 296, Ptolemy Soter took the island, after which it remained under Egypt till conquered by the Romans.</p>
 <p>Literature and the arts flourished in Cyprus even from a very early period, as witness the “Cypria Carmina,” by some attributed to Homer. Citium was the birthplace of Zeno. It is foreign to the present article to trace the history of the island during the Roman rule, the Arabs, the dukedoms of the Crusades, Richard of England, the Lusignans, the Turks, and the recent occupation by the English. Its geographical position made it the field for the exhibition of the arts, deeds, and cults of various nations; and its remains, as brought to light in the explorations of the last twenty-five <figure id="fig.00457.3">

 years, have given a deeper insight into the ancient life and occupations and attainments of its successive peoples and masters than it had been thought possible hitherto to attain, and necessitated the rewriting of the principal chapters in the history of ancient art. From the time of Pococke, who, nearly three centuries ago, made his famous discoveries of Phoenician inscriptions (chiefly about Citium), down to the English occupation, scattered and partial explorations have been made. The discovery, in the first half of this century, of inscriptions in a character hitherto unknown, and their decipherment, from 1873 onward, has furnished most valuable clues to the history of religions in Cyprus and the transference of deities thither from the East, besides many minor historical matters and a vast addition to the knowledge of Greek dialects. The characters are syllabic, with peculiar laws of writing, and the language Greek. Some hundreds of these inscriptions are now known (the most of them found by Di Cesnola)—some bilingual (Phoenician and Cypriote) and some digraphic (Greek and Cypriote). The decipherment is a brilliant record—George Smith, of England, discovering the key in a bilingual inscription now in the British Museum; R. H. Lang simultaneously and independently proving the incorrectness of certain previous attempts by others; after which Samuel Birch made additional progress; and complete inscriptions were first read simultaneously and independently by Justus Siegismund and W. Deecke of Strassburg, M. Schmidt of Jena, and I. H. Hall of New York, since which time many writers have contributed lexicographic and dialectic additions.</p>
 <p>The discoveries by exploration and excavation have been chiefly made (though the work of others is not inconsiderable) by L. P. di Cesnola, while U. S. Consul at Cyprus, from 1866 to 1877. His work covered nearly all parts of the island, discovering the sites of many ancient cities, and ruins of others whose ancient identity is not yet known, besides many temples, necropoles, ancient aqueducts, and other remains, including over 200 inscriptions, in Assyrian, Cypriote, Phoenician, Greek, and Latin. The greatest number (many thousands) and most important of the objects discovered are deposited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, though many found their way to European museums and private collections. The <figure id="fig.00458">

Since the occupation of Cyprus by the English, others have excavated and explored, but by no means on the same scale, the principal <cb /> works accomplished being the further excavation of the site of the greater temple of Venus at Old Paphos, and some large operations near Salamis.</p>

</figure> the Mediterranean, from Carthage to the Nile, was a barren, sandy waste, and partly to the actual fertility of Cyrenaïca itself. It was extremely well watered, and the inhabitants, according to Herodotus (iv. 199), employed eight months in collecting the productions of the land; the maritime places first yielded their fruits, then the second region, which they called the hills, and lastly those of the highest part inland. One of the chief natural productions of Cyrenaïca was an herb called <seg lang="la">silphium</seg>, a kind of laserpitium or assafoetida. It was fattening for cattle, rendering their flesh also tender, and was a useful aperient for man. From its juice, too, when kneaded with clay, a powerful antiseptic was obtained. The silphium formed a great article of trade, and at Rome the composition above mentioned sold for its weight in silver. It is for this reason that the silphium appeared always on the medals of Cyrené. Its culture was neglected, however, when the Romans became masters of the country, and pasturage was more attended to. Cyrenaïca was called Pentapolis from its having five cities of

<head orig="Cyrenaĭci">Cyrenaici</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυρηναϊκοί</foreign>). A sect of philosophers who followed the doctrines of <ref type="cross" target="crossaristippus">Aristippus</ref> (q.v.), and whose name was derived from their founder's having been a native of Cyrené, and from their school having been established in this place. Aristippus made the <seg lang="la">summum bonum</seg> and the <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign> of man to consist in enjoyment, accompanied by good taste and freedom of mind, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ κρατεῖν καὶ μὴ ἡττᾶσθαι ἡδόνων ἄριστον, οὐ τὸ μὴ χρῆσθαι</foreign> ( <bibl n="Diog.  2. 75" default="NO">Diog. Laert.ii. 75</bibl>). Happiness, said the Cyrenaics, consists, not in tranquillity or indolence, but in a pleasing agitation of the mind or in active enjoyment. Pleasure (<foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή</foreign>) is the ultimate object of human pursuit; it is only in subserviency to this that fame, friendship, and even virtue are to be desired. All crimes are venial, because never committed except through the immediate impulse of passion. Nothing is just or unjust by nature, but by custom and law. The business of philosophy is to regulate the senses in that manner which will render them most productive of pleasure. Since, then, pleasure is to be derived, not from the past or the future, but the present, a wise man will take care to enjoy the present hour, and will be indifferent to life or death. Such were the tenets of the Cyrenaic School. The short duration of this sect was owing, in part, to the remote distance of Cyrené from Greece, the chief seat of learning and philosophy; in part to the unbounded latitude which these philosophers allowed themselves in practice as well as opinion; and finally to the rise of the Epicurean School, which taught the doctrine of pleasure in a more philosophical form. The Cyrenaic teaching that pleasure is the only good was developed in a curious way by <ref type="cross" target="crosshegesias">Hegesias</ref> (q.v.), who argued that as pleasure is the only good, and that as, by reason of the uncertainties of life, an existence of pure pleasure is impossible of attainment by man, the true philosopher will not seek to live, but will end his life by suicide. He therefore preached the doctrine of selfdestruction.

It was founded by Battus (B.C. 631), who led a colony from the island of Thera, and he and his descendants ruled over the city for eight generations. It stood eighty stadia (eight geographical miles) from the coast, on the edge of the upper of two terraces of tableland, at the height of 1800 feet above the sea, in one of the finest situations in the world. At a later time Cyrené became subject to the Egyptian Ptolemies, and was eventually formed, with the island of Crete, into a Roman province. The ruins of the city of Cyrené are very extensive. It was the birthplace of Carneades, Callimachus, Eratosthenes, and Aristippus.

<head orig="Cyrus">Cyrus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κῦρος</foreign>; in Persian, <title>Kurus</title>). (1) A celebrated conqueror, and the founder of the Persian Empire. He comes forth in a line of monarchs who ruled in Susiana. According to Herodotus, he was the son of Mandani, daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. The father of Cyrus was the Persian Cambyses. It having been foretold that Mandani's son would become the lord of all Asia, Astyages attempted to destroy the infant, and delivered it to Harpagus, his attendant, to kill. Harpagus, however, fearing the anger of Mandani, gave the child to a herdsman, one Mitradates, who reared the young Cyrus as his own son, under the name of Agradates. When ten years of age, the true parentage of the boy was accidentally discovered by Astyages, who, after punishing Harpagus with great barbarity, sent Cyrus to his parents in Persia. When the young prince grew up, he headed a revolt against Astyages, who had become unpopular by his tyranny, and defeated him in battle (B.C. 559). The Medes then accepted Cyrus as their king.</p>
 <p>He had not been long seated on the throne when his dominions were invaded by Croesus, king of Lydia, the issue of which contest was so fatal to the latter. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscroesus">Croesus</ref>.) The conquest of Lydia established the Persian monarchy on a firm foundation, and Cyrus was now called away to the East by vast designs and by the threats of a distant and formidable enemy. Babylon still remained an independent city in the heart of his empire, and to reduce it was his first and most pressing care. On another side he was tempted by the wealth and weakness of Egypt, while his northern frontier was disturbed and endangered by the fierce barbarians who ranged over the plains that stretch from the skirts of the Indian Caucasus to the Caspian. Until these last should be subdued or humbled his Eastern provinces could never enjoy peace or safety. These objects demanded his own presence; the subjugation of the Asiatic Greeks, as a less urgent and less difficult enterprise, he committed to his lieutenants. While the latter, therefore, were executing his commands in the West, he was himself enlarging and strengthening his power in the East. After completing the subjugation of the nations west of the Euphrates, he marched upon <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylon">Babylon</ref> (q.v.), which he took. The account of this conquest, as described by Herodotus, is given in the article <cb /> <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylon">Babylon</ref>. Recent archaeological discoveries, however, tend to discredit his narrative. A tabletinscription found at Babylon states that Cyrus, “king of Elam,” took Sippara and Babylon “without fighting.” This took place in B.C. 538. See Sayce, <bibl default="NO"><title>Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments</title> (London, 1883)</bibl>; and his <bibl default="NO"><title>Introduction to Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther</title> (2d ed. London, 1887)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Cyrus enjoyed no long interval of repose. The protection which he afforded to the Jews was prob<figure id="fig.00460">
<head orig="Cyrus. (Pasargadae.)">Cyrus. (Pasargadae.)</head>
</figure> ably connected with his designs upon Egypt, but he never found leisure to carry them into effect. Soon after the fall of Babylon he undertook an expedition against one of the nations on the eastern side of the Caspian. According to Herodotus, it was the Massagetae, a nomadic horde which had driven the Scythians before them towards the West; and, after gaining a victory over them by stratagem, he was defeated in a great battle and slain. The event is the same in the narrative of Ctesias; but the people against whom Cyrus marched are called the Derbices, and their army is strengthened by troops and elephants furnished by Indian allies; while the death of Cyrus is speedily avenged by one of his vassals, Amorges, king of the Sacae, who gains a decisive victory over the Derbices, and annexes their land to the Persian Empire. Cyrus died in B.C. 529. His son and successor, Cambyses, had been made by him king of Babylon three years before. Cyrus was one of the greatest Asiatics who ever lived; and with the exception of Egypt, the greater part of the Old World was under his rule at the time of his death. His capitals were Ecbatana and Susa; and his tomb exists to-day at Murgab, near Pasargadae.
 </p>
 <p>(2) Commonly called “the Younger,” to distinguish him from the preceding, was the second of the four sons of Darius Nothus and Parysatis. According to the customs of the monarchy, his elder brother Artaxerxes was the legitimate heir-apparent; but Cyrus was the first son born to Darius after his accession to the throne, and he was also his mother's favourite. She had encouraged him to hope that, as Xerxes, through the influence of Atossa, had been preferred to his elder brother, who was born while their father was yet in a private station, so she should be able to persuade Darius to set aside Artaxerxes and declare Cyrus his successor. In the meanwhile he was invested with the government of the western provinces. This appointment he seems from the first to have considered as a step to the throne. He had, however, sagacity and courage enough to perceive that, should he be disappointed in his first expectations, 
<pb n="461" /><cb /> the co-operation of the Greeks might still enable him to force his way to the throne. It was with this view that he zealously embraced the side of Sparta in her struggle with Athens, both as the power which he found in the most prosperous condition and as that which was most capable of furthering his designs. According to Plutarch (<title>Artax.</title> 2), Cyrus went to attend his father's sick-bed with sanguine hopes that his mother had accomplished her purpose, and that he was sent for to receive the crown. On his arrival at court, however, he saw himself disappointed in his expectations, and found that he had only come to witness his father's death and his brother's accession to the throne. He accompanied Artaxerxes, whom the Greeks distinguished by the epithet of Mnemon, to Pasargadae, where the Persian kings went through certain mystic ceremonies of inauguration, and Tissaphernes took this opportunity of charging Cyrus with a design against his life. It would seem, from Plutarch's account, that one of the officiating priests was suborned to support the charge, though it is by no means certain that it was unfounded. Artaxerxes was convinced of its truth, and determined on putting his brother to death; and Cyrus was only saved by the passionate entreaties of Parysatis, in whose arms he had sought refuge from the executioner. On this occasion Artaxerxes suffered her to overpower both the suspicions suggested by Tissaphernes and the jealousy which the temper and situation of Cyrus might reasonably have excited. He not only pardoned his brother, but permitted him to return to his government. Cyrus felt himself not obliged, but humbled, by his rival's clemency; and the danger he had escaped only strengthened his resolution to make himself, as soon as possible, independent of the power to which he owed his life.</p>
 <p>Immediately after his return to Sardis, he began to make preparations for the execution of his designs. The chief difficulty was to keep them concealed from Artaxerxes until they were fully matured; for though his mother, who was probably from the beginning acquainted with his purpose, was at court, always ready to put the most favourable construction on his conduct, yet Tissaphernes was at hand to watch it with malignant attention and to send the earliest information of any suspicious movement to the king. Cyrus, however, devised a variety of pretexts to blind Tissaphernes and the court, while he collected an army for the expedition which he was meditating. His main object was to raise as strong a body of Greek troops as he could, for it was only with such aid that he could hope to overpower an adversary who had the whole force of the Empire at his command; and he knew enough of the Greeks to believe that their superiority over his countrymen, in skill and courage, was sufficient to compensate for almost any inequality of numbers.</p>
 <p>In the spring of B.C. 401, Cyrus began his march from Sardis. His whole Grecian force, a part of which joined him on the route, amounted to 11,000 heavy infantry and about 2000 targeteers. His barbarian troops were 100,000 strong. After directing his line of march through the whole extent of Asia Minor, he entered the Babylonian territory; and it was not until he reached the plain of Cunaxa, between sixty and seventy miles from Babylon, that he became certain of his brother's <cb /> intention to hazard an engagement. Artaxerxes met him in this spot at the head of an army of 900,000 men. If we may believe Plutarch, the Persian monarch had continued to waver almost to the last between the alternatives of fighting and retreating, and was only diverted from adopting the latter course by the energetic remonstrances of Tiribazus. In the battle which ensued the Greeks soon routed the barbarians opposed to them, but committed an error in pursuing them too far; and Cyrus was compelled, in order to avoid being surrounded by the rest of the king's army, to make an attack upon the centre, where his brother led in person. He routed the royal body-guard, and being hurried away by the violence of his feelings the moment he espied the king, he engaged with him, but was himself wounded and slain by a common soldier. Had Clearchus acted in conformity with the directions of Cyrus, and led his division against the king's centre, instead of being drawn off into pursuit of the flying enemy, the victory must have belonged to Cyrus. According to the Persian custom of treating slain rebels, the head and right hand of Cyrus were cut off and brought to the king, who is said himself to have seized the head by the hair and to have held it up as a proof of his victory to the view of the surrounding crowd. Thus ended the expedition of Cyrus. The Greeks, after the battle, began to negotiate with the king through Tissaphernes, who offered to lead them home. He treacherously violated his word, however; and having, by an act of perfidy, obtained possession of the persons of the Greek commanders, he sent them up to the king at Babylon, where they were all put to death. The Greeks were not, however, discouraged, though at a great distance from their country and surrounded on every side by a powerful enemy. They immediately chose new commanders, in the number of whom was Xenophon, who has given an account of their celebrated retreat. See <ref type="cross" target="crossanabasis">Anabasis</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύζικος</foreign>). (1) An island off the northern coast of Mysia, nearly triangular in shape, and about five hundred stadia in circuit. Its base was turned towards the Propontis, while the vertex advanced so closely to the continent that it was easy to connect it by a double bridge, which, as Pliny relates, was done by Alexander. Scylax, however, says that it was always a peninsula, and his authority is followed by Mannert, who is of opinion that the inhabitants may, after the time of Scylax, have separated it from the mainland by a canal or ditch, for purposes of security. It is certainly a peninsula at the present day, and there are no indica tions whatever of the bridges mentioned by Pliny and others.<cb /></p>
 <p>(2) A celebrated city of Mysia, on the island of the same name, situated partly in the plain which extended to the bridges connecting the island with the continent, and partly on the slope of Mount Arcton Oros. Its first foundation was ascribed to a colony of Pelasgi from Thessaly, under the conduct of Cyzicus, son of Apollo. In process of time the Pelasgi were expelled by the Tyrrheni, and these again made way for the Milesians, who are generally looked upon by the Greeks as the real settlers, to whom the foundation of Cyzicus is to be attributed. Cyzicus became, in process of time, a flourishing commercial city, and was at the height of its prosperity when, through the means of the kings of Pergamus, it secured the favour and protection of Rome. Florus speaks of its beauty and opulence. The Cyzicene commonwealth resembled those of Rhodes, Marseilles, and Carthage. The Romans, in acknowledgment of the bravery and fidelity displayed by the Cyzicenians when besieged by Mithridates (B.C. 75), granted to them their independence and greatly enlarged their territory. Under the emperors, Cyzicus continued to prosper, and in the time of the Byzantine sway it was the metropolis of the Hellespontine province. Cyzicus gave birth to several historians, philosophers, and other writers. The coins of this place, called <foreign lang="greek">Κυζικηνοὶ στατῆρες</foreign>, were so beautiful as to be deemed a miracle of art. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosselectrum">Electrum</ref>.) Persephoné was worshipped as the chief deity of the place, and the inhabitants had a legend among them that their city was given by Zeus to this goddess as a portion of her dowry.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
