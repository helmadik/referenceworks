 <p>A Roman rhetorician of Burdigala (Bordeaux), a younger contemporary and friend of the poet Ausonius. We possess from his pen a panegyric on the emperor Theodosius the Great, delivered before the Senate at Rome in B.C. 389. It is distinguished beyond the other speeches of this class by a certain vigour of thought resembling Tacitus, and is also of value as an historical authority. It is edited, with notes, by Arntzen <bibl default="NO">(Amsterdam, 1753)</bibl>, and by Bährens <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1874)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosspacuvius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pacuvius">Pacuvius</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>. A Roman tragedian, born about B.C. 220 at Brundisium. He is described as being the son of Ennius's sister, and pupil of the poet (Euseb. <title>Chron.</title> 156, 3;  <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>64</bibl>). He spent most of his life at Rome, where he gained his livelihood as a dramatic poet and as a painter. In his old age he returned to Lower Italy, and died there, at the age of ninety, about B.C. 130 ( <bibl n="Gel.  1. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.i. 24</bibl>). He is the first Roman dramatist who confined himself to the composition of tragedies. Titles and fragments of some thirteen of his imitations of Greek plays are preserved, as well as fragments of a <seg lang="la">fabula praetexta</seg> entitled <title>Paulus</title>, whose hero was probably the victor of Pydna, Aemilius Paulus. If this small number justifies any opinion on his poetical activity, he was far less productive than his predecessor Ennius and his successor Attius. Nevertheless, he and Attius were considered the most important tragedians of Rome. In the judgment of literary critics, who followed the traditions of the Ciceronian Age, he was preferred to Attius for finish and learning, but Attius excelled him in fire and natural power ( <title>Epist.</title> ii. 1, 55, 56; <bibl n="Quint.  10. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. 1</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  97" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 97</bibl>). His style was praised for its copiousness, dignity, and stateliness, though Cicero (<title>Brutus</title>, 258) declines to give him credit for pure and genuine Latinity. Even in Cicero's time, however, the revival of his plays was often welcomed by Roman audiences, and for his dignity and command of language he was often styled <seg lang="la">doctus.</seg> Pacuvius was also successful in his painting, and one of his works in the temple of Hercules in the Forum Boarium was greatly admired ( <bibl n="Gel.  13.2.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii.2.2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The dramatic fragments of Pacuvius are edited by Ribbeck <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1871)</bibl>. See a paper by Prof. Nettleship in the (English) <title>Journal of Philology</title>, xviii. 263 foll.; and Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, iii. p. 536 (American ed.).

<div2 id="crosspadus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Padus">Padus</head>

 <p> Now the Po; the chief river of Italy, identified by the Roman poets with the fabulous <ref type="cross" target="crosseridanus">Eridănus</ref>, from which amber was obtained. This notion appears to have arisen from the Phoenician vessels receiving at the mouths of the Padus the amber which had been transported by land from the coasts of the Baltic to those of the Adriatic. 
<pb n="1154" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The name is said to be derived from the Keltic <seg lang="la">padi</seg>, “pine-tree” (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 122" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iii. 122</bibl>). By the Ligurians it was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Bodencus</hi>. The Padus rises on Mount Vesula (Monte Viso), in the Alps, and flows in an easterly direction through the great plain of Cisalpine Gaul, which it divides into two parts, Gallia Cispadana and Gallia Transpadana. It receives numerous affluents, which drain the whole of this vast plain, descending from the Alps on the north and the Apennines on the south. These affluents, increased in the summer by the melting of the snow on the mountains, frequently bring down such a large body of water as to cause the Padus to overflow its banks. The whole course of the river, including its windings, is about 450 miles. About twenty miles from the sea the river divides itself into two main branches, and falls into the Adriatic Sea by several mouths (the ancients enumerated seven), between Ravenna and Altinum. Strabo believed the Padus to be the largest river in Europe after the Danube, and Vergil calls it <seg lang="la">fluviorum rex </seg>( <bibl n="Verg. G. 1. 482" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>i. 482</bibl>).

<head orig="Paean">Paean</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παιάν, Παιήων, Παιών</foreign>, “the healer,” “helper”). In Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5. 401" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>v. 401</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 899" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 899</bibl>) the physician of the Olympian gods; then an epithet of gods who grant recovery and deliverance, especially of Apollo. The paean, which appears in Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 473" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 473</bibl>; xxii. 391), was connected originally with Apollo and his sister Artemis. It was a solemn song for several voices, either praying for the averting of evil and for rescue, or giving thanks for help vouchsafed. The name was, however, also used in an extended sense for invocations to other gods. The paean was struck up by the generals before the battle and by armies on the march against the enemy as well as after the victory. Similarly it was sounded when the fleet sailed out of a harbour. Paeans were sung at entertainments between the meal and the carousal, and eventually also at public funerals.

The name among the Greeks for the slave who had the duty of looking after the son of his master while in boyhood, instructing him in certain rules of good manners, and attending him whenever he went out, especially to school and to the palaestra and gymnasium. With the Romans in earlier times it was an old slave or freedman who had a similar duty as <seg lang="la">custos;</seg> but after it became the custom to have even children taught to speak Greek, his place was filled by a Greek slave, who bore the Greek name and had the special duty of instructing his pupils in Greek.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παιώνιος</foreign>). (1) A Greek sculptor of Mendé in Thrace. About B.C. 436 he was employed in the decoration of the temple of Zeus in Olympia. According to Pausanias (v. 10 6), he was the sculptor of the marble groups in the front, or eastern, pediment of the temple, representing the preparations for the chariot-race between Pelops and Oenomaüs. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossolympia">Olympia</ref>.) Important portions of these have been brought to light by German excavators. He was also the sculptor of the figure of Niké, more than life-size, dedicated by the Messenians (Pausan. v. 26 1), which has been restored to us by the same means.

It was colonized by the Sybarites about B.C. 524, and soon became a powerful and flourishing city. It was captured by the Lucanians about B.C. 430 and gradually lost its Greek characteristics. Under the Romans it gradually sank in importance, and in the time of Augustus it is mentioned only on account of the beautiful roses grown in its neighbourhood. The ruins of

<head orig="Pagus">Pagus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πάγος</foreign>). In Italy, in ancient times, the pagus was a country district with scattered hamlets (<seg lang="la">vici</seg>). The same name was given to its fortified centre, which protected the sanctuaries of the district and served as a refuge in time of war. The separate districts were members of a larger community. After cities had developed out of the places where the people of these districts assembled, the pagi were either completely merged in <cb /> their territorium or continued to exist merely as geographical districts, without importance for administration, or as subordinate village communities. In Rome the earliest population consisted of the <seg lang="la">montani</seg>, the inhabitants of the seven hills of the city, and the <seg lang="la">pagani</seg>, the inhabitants of the level ground of the city. Out of the two Servius Tullius made the four city tribes. The country tribes doubtless arose similarly out of pagi, the names of which were in some cases transferred to them. Like the old division into <seg lang="la">pagani</seg> and <seg lang="la">montani</seg>, the old districts under the authority of <seg lang="la">magistri</seg> long continued to exist for sacred purposes. They had their special guardian deities, temples, and rites, which survived even the introduction of Christianity. To the district festivals belonged especially the <ref type="cross" target="crosspaganalia">Paganalia</ref> (q.v.), the <ref type="cross" target="crossambarvalia">Ambarvalia</ref> (q.v.), at which the festal procession carefully traversed the old boundaries of the district; and, lastly, the Terminalia (see <ref type="cross" target="crossterminus">Terminus</ref>).

He acquired a learned education while accompanying his master's son to school, and, after he had been set free, taught at Rome in the first half of the first century after Christ, under Tiberius and Claudius, with extraordinary success in spite of his thoroughly disreputable character. The earlier scholars, and especially Varro, had made the older literature the centre of their linguistic studies. Palaemon, as head of a new school, devoted himself especially to Vergil, just as Greek literary criticism had concentrated itself on Homer. He seems to have treated grammar in the practical spirit of a clever schoolmaster, and to have done his best to deride the scientific labours of Varro. His grammar (<seg lang="la">ars</seg>, <bibl n="Juv.  7. 251" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 251</bibl>) was doubtless much consulted by later grammarians. It is now lost.

 <p>The earliest form of manuscript was the roll. For full details, see <ref type="cross" target="crossliber">Liber</ref>. From the manuscript, the writing was often erased to make room for new matter. In this case it was called a palimpsest (<foreign lang="greek">παλιμψηστος</foreign>). See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalimpsest">Palimpsest</ref>.</p>
 <p>The copyists of the manuscripts (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματεῖς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">scribae</seg>) were in classical times usually slaves especially trained; in the Middle Ages, monks. For short-hand writers (<seg lang="la">notarii</seg>), see <ref type="cross" target="crossnotae">Notae</ref>.</p>
 <p>There are four sorts of Greek writing: capitals, uncials, cursives, and minuscules. The capitals are found chiefly in manuscripts, in letters and initial letters. The uncials are the most common form of letters in ancient books, and resemble the modern capital. The breathings and accents are generally omitted, and the iota subscript is written by the side of its vowel—at the right. The cursive was gradually developed out of the uncial, 
<pb n="1157" /><cb />
 from which it differed more and more. It is found in manuscripts of the second century B.C. and as late as the seventh century A.D. Minuscules prevail after the ninth century A.D. <figure id="fig.01157">
<head orig="Latin Poem on the Battle of Actium. (Before A.D. 79.)">Latin Poem on the Battle of Actium. (Before A.D. 79.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>There are also the same four varieties of writing in Latin manuscripts. The capitals appear in a poem by Rabirius (?) on the battle of Actium found at Herculaneum, in the Vatican and Florence Vergils, and in the Paris Prudentius. The uncials, which are distinguished by the rounded forms of the letters (especially U), were perfected in the fourth century A.D. and lasted till the ninth. The Veronese palimpsest of Livy is in uncials. There are many specimens of the Roman cursive in the <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> of Pompeii (see vol. iv. of the <title>Corp. Inscrip. Lat.</title>) and elsewhere. It varied at different periods, and gave rise to different mediaeval forms of writing—e. g. the Lombardic, Visigothic, etc. The Roman minuscules were not developed until the end of the eighth century A.D. <figure id="fig.01157.2">
<head orig="Pompeian Wall Inscription. (First Century, A.D.)">Pompeian Wall Inscription. (First Century, A.D.)</head>
</figure> in the school of Alcuin, and reached their perfection in the twelfth century. They are the source of the earliest Italic characters. If a Latin manuscript is wholly in capitals, it is earlier than the eighth century; and when the words are not spaced it is earlier than the seventh. Stiff, upright characters denote a late date. The uncial writings are usually earlier than the eighth century; the minuscule prevails after the ninth; a great number of abbreviations indicates the eleventh century. If a text is written in cursive that has great facility in its ligatures, it is presumably antique. See <ref type="cross" target="crossalphabet">Alphabet</ref>.</p>
 <p>The greatest difficulty in deciphering manuscripts comes from the contractions, abbreviations, and ligatures which they contain. Thus, the copyists in mediaeval France used more than 5000 forms of contraction. The following are a few that are common, and hence may serve as illustrations: <hi rend="italic">qm=quum</hi> or <seg lang="la">quoniam; qūō=quomodo; .n.=enim;</seg> <figure />=<seg lang="la">est; o[mtilde]s=omnes; hõiñ=hominum; āūt=autem; ā=annos;</seg> p=<seg lang="la">prae;</seg> pp.= <seg lang="la">prope.</seg> <cb /> <figure id="fig.01157.3">

The Romans did not come into contact with the country till B.C. 63, when Pompey took Jerusalem. From this time the country was really subject to the Romans. At the death of Herod his kingdom was divided between his sons as tetrarchs; but the different parts of Palestine were eventually annexed to the Roman province of Syria, and were governed by a procurator. The Jews were by no means well disposed, however, to the rule of the Romans, and in the first century A.D. broke out with a general rebellion which was crushed out by Vespasian and Titus with merciless severity. The latter general took Jerusalem and destroyed it in A.D. 70.

He accordingly got Odysseus and Diomedes to conceal in his tent a letter purporting to be written by Priam, as well as some money, and then accuse him as a traitor; whereupon he was stoned to death by the people.

 <p>The house of Augustus (<title>domus Augustana</title>) was built upon the southwestern edge of the Palatine Hill and overlooked the Circus Maximus. He had at first purchased the house of the orator Hortensius, also on the Palatine, and when it was struck by lightning he consecrated the spot to a temple of Apollo, and bought some neighbouring buildings, where he built a house for himself (Vell. Pat. ii. 81; Dio Cass. xlix. 15;  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>29</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Aug. 72" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. Aug., 72</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The house of Tiberius (<title>domus Tiberiana</title>) on the Palatine is mentioned as distinct from that of Augustus, though it adjoined it, the palace of Augustus being more conspicuous towards the Forum, while that of Tiberius formed the back front. Its situation is indicated by the statements of the ancient writers that Otho descended through the back of the palace of Tiberius into the Velabrum ( <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 27" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 27</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Otho 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Otho</title>, 6</bibl>), and that Vitellius surveyed from it the conflagration of the Capitol ( <title>Vitell.</title> 6). During the reign of Augustus, Tiberius lived first in the house of Pompey in the Carinae, and afterwards in that of Maecenas on the Esquiline, but when he became emperor he probably resided in this house on the Palatine till he withdrew to Capreae. In later 
<pb n="1159" /><cb />
 times this palace was the residence of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, and a library was established there ( <bibl n="Gel.  13. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xiii. 19</bibl>). The palaces of Augustus and Tiberins were destroyed in the fire of Nero; but they were rebuilt, as they are mentioned as separate buildings in the <title>Notitia;</title> and Josephus tells us that the different parts of the complex of buildings forming the imperial palace were named after their respective founders ( <bibl n="Fro. Ant. 19. 1. 15" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>xix. 1. 15</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The palace of Augustus was excavated in 1775, and drawings made of it by Gnattani (<bibl default="NO"><title>Monumenti Antichi di Roma</title>, 1785</bibl>); the whole was soon covered in again, and no part is now visible. That part of the plan shown here, which represents the palace of Augustus, is taken from Guattani's plan.</p>
 <p>This palace, which was of very modest size, had a number of small rooms in two stories grouped round one peristyle: its comparative simplicity must have formed a striking contrast to the stately splendour of the public halls, libraries, and temples in the adjoining Area Apollinis, all built by Augustus, and adorned by him with countless works of art of every kind. Nevertheless, though the palace <figure id="fig.01159">
<head orig="Plan of the Palace of Augustus and the Flavian Emperors.">Plan of the Palace of Augustus and the Flavian Emperors.</head>
</figure> of Augustus was small, yet it appears to have been designed with great taste, and decorated with considerable richness in its mixture of white and coloured marbles. That it was a very carefully designed architectural affair is shown by the base plan with its domed and vaulted halls and small apse-like recesses arranged with some complications and much ingenuity.</p>
 <p>The Flavian Palace, which is shown on the same plan, was built by Domitian, adjoining the Area of Apollo and the Palace of Augustus on the northwest side ( <title>Popl.</title> 15; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 36</bibl>;  <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 3. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>iii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 47</bibl>; iv. 2). Extensive remains of this building still exist, and are among the most conspicuous of the imperial palaces on the Palatine. It was a very different building from that of Augustus, being not so much a place of residence as a magnificent series of State apartments intended for public use. Hence Nerva had the words <seg lang="la">aedes publicae</seg> inscribed on it (Pliny , <title>Panegyr.</title> 47). At <cb /> one end is a very splendid throne-room, with a <seg lang="la">lararium</seg> or imperial chapel on one side and a <seg lang="la">basilica</seg> for judicial business on the other. At the other end of the peristyle is the <seg lang="la">triclinium</seg> for State banquets, and beyond it a series of stately halls, which may possibly be libraries (<seg lang="la">bibliothecae</seg>), and an <title>Academia</title> for recitations and other literary purposes. A sort of <title>Nymphaeum</title>, or room containing a fountain, with flowers, plants, and statues of nymphs and river-gods, was placed at one side of the <seg lang="la">triclinium</seg>, if not on both, so that the murmur and coolness of the water and the scent of the flowers might refresh the wine-heated guests. The whole of this magnificent palace was adorned with the greatest richness, both of design and materials, with floors, wall-linings, and columns of Oriental marbles, alabaster, and red and green porphyry. Even the rows of colossal statues which decorated the throne-room were made of the very refractory basalts and porphyry from the quarries of Egypt, at a cost of an almost incredible amount of labour: remains of these were found early in the last century. The position of the Flavian palace is remarkable; it is built on an immense artificial platform which bridges over a deep valley or depression in the summit of the Palatine.</p>
 <p>Remains of a lofty building of Republican date still exist deep below the floor-level of the so-called libraries; and a small house of early imperial date, richly decorated with marbles and paintings, can still be seen buried under the great peristyle. In many parts of the palace traces are distinctly visible of restorations made by Severus after the great fire in the reign of Commodus (A.D. 191), which devastated a large portion of the imperial palaces. The cracked and partly calcined marbles which suffered in the fire were broken up, and used to make concrete for the new walls of Severus; and thus, in many places, the somewhat curious sight is to be seen of concrete made of the most costly Oriental marbles and porphyries.</p>
 <p>The enormous palace of Caligula occupied the northern corner of the Palatine Hill and the adjoining slopes as far as the Forum, covering the ground once occupied by the houses of Clodius, Cicero, and other wealthy Romans (Dio Cass. lix. 28;  <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>22</bibl>; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  111" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 111</bibl>). The equally large palace of Severus occupied the opposite end of the Palatine. They are both remarkable for the gigantic substructures on which they stand, constructed so as to form at the foot of the hill a basement for State rooms on a level with the highest part of the ground, or, in other words, at both places the Palatine itself was enlarged by the construction of an artificial hill of massive concrete walls and vaults. On one side Severus used the stately palace of Hadrian as a sort of platform on which to extend his new palace at the higher level; and so we see the rough concrete walls of Severus's substructure cutting through and rendering useless the richly ornamented halls of Hadrian. The enormous height of the palace of Severus must have made it one of the most imposing of all the buildings of Rome: its southern part, which stood at the foot of the Palatine Hill, not only equalled the hill in height, but towered high above its summit. In costliness of material, though not in delicacy of design, this palace more than equalled the buildings of the earlier emperors, with the exception of that which Nero built. Some additions and improvements were made to the palace of Septimius Severus

 <p>The Golden House (<seg lang="la">domus aurea</seg>) of Nero, which covered part of the Palatine and Esquiline hills and the great valley between them, must have been a building of the most marvellous splendour and extent. It was nearly a mile in length, and included large gardens and parks for wild animals, all surrounded by a triple <seg lang="la">porticus</seg> or colonnade of marble. The interior was decorated in the most lavish way with gold, ivory, and jewels ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xv. 42</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Nero 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Nero</title>, 31</bibl>; <title>Spect.</title> 2). Some rooms, according to Suetonius, were entirely plated with gold and studded with precious stones and pearls. The supper-rooms were vaulted with ivory panels (<seg lang="la">lacunaria</seg>), from openings in which flowers and perfumes were scattered on the guests. An enormous number of works of art of every class collected from Greek cities were brought to adorn the palace, and others were made by Nero's orders, such as the bronze colossal statue of himself, 120 feet high, the work of the Greek sculptor Zenodorus, and a painted portrait on canvas of the same ridiculous size. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolossus">Colossus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The destruction of the Golden House and the restoration of most of its site to public uses were among the most popular acts of the Flavian emperors. Both the Colosseum and the great Thermae of Titus stand on part of the site of Nero's palace, of which a small portion was used, after being stripped of its rich marble linings, to form the substructures of part of the Thermae of Titus. This is almost the only part which now exists: remains of a large peristyle and the lofty rooms round it are still fairly well preserved; the vaults are richly decorated with stucco reliefs and paintings, which are rapidly perishing. It was the discovery of these elaborate ornaments early in the sixteenth century which gave so great an impulse to the growing love for classical methods of decoration. Raphael and his pupils with great skill copied the stucco-work, and painted arabesques in the Vatican palace, in the Villa Madama, and in a large number of other buildings. Owing to these magnificent rooms having been used as the substructures of the baths of Titus, most writers on the subject have described the paintings as being part of the work of Titus. But, though the walls of these two structures are mixed in a somewhat complicated way, it is very easy to distinguish one from the other. Titus's walls are of plain brickfaced concrete, without any stucco covering, while Nero's are in all cases either coated with painted stucco or with the cement backing of the missing marble lining. Even where the stucco has in some places fallen off Nero's walls, clear evidence as to <cb /> its former existence is given by the marble plugs with which the wallsurface was studded to form a key for the plastering.</p>

 <p> The Italian goddess of shepherds and pastoral life. Her festival, the Palilia or Parilia, held on April 21st, was properly a herdsmen's festival to promote the fruitfulness of the flocks and to purify the sacred groves and fountains from all unintentional injury or pollution caused by the herds. It was deemed the anniversary of the founding of Rome, the former abode of shepherds. Accordingly, it was celebrated at Rome, as in the villages, by the whole of the inhabitants, with the ancient rites of a shepherds' festival. It was customary to purify house, steading, and sheep with sulphur, and, as a special means of expiation, to offer incense, together with a mixture of the blood of the <title>October equus</title> (q. v.), the ashes of the unborn calf which was burned at the feast of Tellus, and bean-straw which was obtained from the Vestals. When these solemn purifications were over, the cheerful part of the festival began. Bonfires were made of straw and hay; the shepherds leaped across them thrice; cakes of millet were also offered to the goddess; and the festival was concluded by a feast in the open air. After the second century of our era the festival was combined with that of Dea Roma, and was celebrated as her birthday with festal processions and Circensian games, which continued till the fifth century A.D.</p>
 <p>There seems to have been at one time a male deity of the name Pales (Arnob. iii. 40), but the masculine form had fallen into disuse in classical times. The word contains the root of the verb <seg lang="la">pasco</seg>, and hence means “the Feeder” or “Pasturer.”

 <p> (from <foreign lang="greek">πάλιν</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">ψέω</foreign>). The name given to a manuscript from which the original writing has been rubbed off, in order that the leaves may be used again for fresh writing. This process is occasionally repeated, so that the leaves receive a third text. The MS. is then called a double palimpsest. The word <seg lang="la">palimpsestus</seg> is found in Catullus (<bibl n="Catul. 22.5" default="NO" valid="yes">22. 5</bibl>) and Cicero (<title>Ad Fam.</title> vii. 18, 2), and the Greek form <foreign lang="greek">παλίμψηστος</foreign> in Plutarch (<title>Cum Princip. Philosoph.</title> ad fin.). From vellum and strong substances the writing was removed by scraping or rubbing, but from the delicate papyrus leaves by washing, usually with a sponge ( <bibl n="Mart.  4. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 10</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 85" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>85</bibl>). These erasures were often so carelessly done that the original text can usually be restored and read, at least in part, especially when chemicals are used to intensify the traces that remain. Of these chemicals, the one oftenest employed is the hydrosulphuret of ammonia. Many important texts, both classical and biblical, have been recovered from palimpsests when they have been erased for the purpose of writing less valuable matter. Among these are portions of the <title>De Republica</title> of Cicero of the fourth century, hidden under a work of St. Augustine on the Psalms (Vatican); the <title>Commentarii</title> of the jurist Gaius under St. Jerome (Verona); fragments of Plautus, written in rustic capitals in the fourth (?) century (Milan); and part of the first decade of Livy (from bks. iii.-vi.), under the <title>Moralia</title> of Gregory the Great (Verona). No work as a whole, however, has ever been recovered from a palimpsest. Many fac-similes of these palimpsest MSS. are given by Zangemeister in his <title>Exempla Codicum Latinorum</title> (Heidelberg, 1876, 1879 foll.) and by Wattenbach.

A name generally applied to any image of Pallas Athené, but specifically to the one which was kept secretly hidden as insuring the safety of the town possessing it. The most famous effigy of this sort was the carved image preserved jealously in the citadel of Troy. It is described as of three cubits in height, the feet placed close together, holding a spear in its right hand, and either a distaff or a shield in its left. It was traditionally said to have been given by the goddess herself to Chrysé, the bride of Dardanus, who brought it to Dardania, whence Ilus carried it to Troy. Another legend makes Zeus to have sent it to Ilus from heaven. It was believed that Troy could not be taken so long as the image remained in the city; whereupon Odysseus and Diomedes stole it away and carried it to Argos (Conon , <title>Narrat.</title> 34;  <bibl n="Verg.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πάλμυρα</foreign>; the O. T. Tadmor). A celebrated city of Syria, standing in an oasis of the great Syrian Desert, which from its position was a halting-place for the caravans between Syria and Mesopotamia. Here Solomon built a city, which was called in Hebrew Tadmor—that is, “a city of palm-trees.” Of this name the Greek Palmyra is a translation. Under Hadrian and the Antonines it was highly favoured, and reached its greatest splendour. The history of its temporary elevation to the rank of a capital, in the third century of the Christian era, is related under <ref type="cross" target="crossodenathus">Odenathus</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosszenobia">Zenobia</ref>. After its capture by Aurelian in A.D. 270 it was partly destroyed, but was made a frontier fortress, and under Justinian was strongly fortified. When the Arabs overran the country it was taken by them, and in the year 1400 was plundered by the Tartars under Tamerlane. Its splendid ruins, which form a most striking object in the midst of the desert, are of the Roman period. They resemble those of <ref type="cross" target="crossheliopolis">Heliopolis</ref> (q.v.), though less fine.

A narrow strip of the southern coast of Asia Minor, extending in a sort of arch along the Sinus Pamphylius (Gulf of Adalia), between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east, and on the north bordering on Pisidia.

<head orig="Pan">Pan</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πάν</foreign>). The Greek god of flocks and shepherds, described as the son of the Arcadian shepherd deity Hermes and Dryops, by others as the son of Hermes and Penelopé ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 145" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 145</bibl>), and by still others as the offspring of Penelopé by all the suitors. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspenelope">Penelopé</ref>.) The Homeric hymn describes him as delighting <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the gods, and thus getting his name. He was perfectly developed from his birth; and when his mother saw him she ran away through fear; but Hermes carried him to Olympus, where all the gods were delighted with him, especially Dionysus. He was originally only an Arcadian god; and Arcadia was always the principal seat of his worship. From this country his name and worship afterwards spread over other parts of Greece; but at Athens his worship was not introduced until the time of the battle of Marathon. In Arcadia he was the god of forests, pastures, flocks, and shepherds, and dwelt in grottoes, wandered on the summits of mountains and rocks, and in valleys, either amusing himself with the chase, or leading the dances of the nymphs. As the god of flocks, both of wild and tame animals, it was his province to increase and guard them; but he was also a hunter, and hunters owed their success or failure to him. The Arcadian hunters used to scourge the statue of the god if they had been disappointed in the chase (Theocr. vii. 107). During the heat of midday he used to slumber, and was very indignant when any one disturbed him. As the god of flocks, bees also were under his protection, as well as the coast where fishermen carried on their pursuit. As the god of everything connected with pastoral life, he was fond of music, and the inventor of the syrinx or shepherd's flute, which he himself played in a masterly manner, and in which he instructed others also, such as Daphnis. He is thus said to have loved the poet Pindar, and to have sung and danced his lyric songs, in return for which Pindar erected a sanctuary to him in front of his house.</p>
 <p>Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by travellers, to whom he sometimes appeared, and whom he startled with sudden awe or terror. Thus, when Phidippides, the Athenian, was sent to Sparta to solicit its aid against the Persians, Pan accosted him, and promised to terrify the barbarians if the Athenians would worship him. Hence, sudden fright without any visible cause was ascribed to Pan, and was called a Panic fear (<foreign lang="greek">πανικὸν δεῖμα</foreign>). He is further said to have had a terrible voice, and by it to have frightened the Titans in their fight with the gods. It seems that this <cb /> feature—namely, his fondness of noise and riot— was the cause of his being considered the minister and companion of Cybelé and Dionysus. He was at the same time believed to be possessed of prophetic powers, and to have even instructed Apollo in this art. While roaming in the forests, he fell in love with the nymph Echo, by whom, or by Pitho, he became the father of Iynx. His love of Syrinx, after whom he named his flute, is well known from Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 691" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>i. 691</bibl> foll.). Fir-trees (<foreign lang="greek">πίτυες</foreign>) were sacred to him, since the nymph Pitys, whom <figure id="fig.01164">
<head orig="Pan and the Nymph Echo. (Baumeister.)">Pan and the Nymph Echo. (Baumeister.)</head>
</figure> he loved, had been metamorphosed into that tree; and the sacrifices offered to him consisted of cows, rams, lambs, milk, and honey. Sacrifices were also offered to him in common with Dionysus and the nymphs. The various epithets which are given him by the poets refer either to his singular appearance, or are derived from the names of the places in which he was worshipped. The Romans identified with Pan their own god Inuus, and also Faunus, which name is merely another form of Pan. In works of art Pan is represented as a voluptuous and sensual being, with horns, snub-nose, and goat's feet, sometimes in the act of dancing, and sometimes playing on the syrinx. His attendant deities or demons were known as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Panes</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crosspanisci">Panisci</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Πανίσκοι</foreign>). Famous representations of Pan in sculpture are the so-called Barberini Faun at Munich, the Dancing Pan at Naples, and the Pan (or Faun) of Praxiteles at Rome, which suggested to Hawthorne his famous romance, <title>The Marble Faun.</title> In English literature, besides this romance, Pan is the subject of Landor's <title>Pan and Pitys</title> (see above), <title>Cupid and Pan</title>, Buchanan's <title>Pan</title>, Browning's <title>Pan and Luna</title>, and Swinburne's <title>Pan and Thalassius.</title> See <ref type="cross" target="crosssatyri">Satyri</ref>.

<head orig="Panathenaea">Panathenaea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Παναθήναια</foreign>). The most ancient and most important of Athenian festivals. It was celebrated in honour of Athené, the patron deity of Athens. Related to have been founded in early times by Erichthonius, it is said to have been originally named only Athenaea, and to have first received the name of Panathenaea at the time when Theseus united all the inhabitants of Attica into one body. In memory of the union itself was kept the festival of the <foreign lang="greek">συνοικία</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">συνοίκησις</foreign>, on the 16th of Hecatombaeon (July-August), which may be regarded as a kind of preparatory solemnity to the Panathenaea. There was a festival of the ordinary or lesser Panathenaea celebrated every year, and from the time of Pisistratus, the great Panathenaea held every fifth year, and in the third year of every Olympiad, from the 24th to the 29th of Hecatombaeon. Pisistratus, in the year B.C. 566, added to the original chariot and horse-races athletic contests in each of the traditional forms of competition. He, or his son Hipparchus, instituted the regulation that the collected Homeric poems should be recited at the Feast of Rhapsodes. In 446 Pericles introduced musical contests, which took place on the first day of the festival, in the Odeum, which he had built. Competitions of cyclic choruses and other kinds of dances, torch-races and trireme-races added to the <cb /> splendour of the festival. The care and direction of all these contests were committed to ten stewards (<foreign lang="greek">ἀθλοθέται</foreign>), who were elected by the people for four years, from one great Panathenaic festival to the next (Pollux, viii. 93). In the musical contests the first prize was a golden crown; in the athletic, the prize was a garland of leaves from the sacred olive-trees of Athené, together with large and beautiful vases filled with oil from the same trees. Many specimens of these Panathenaic vases have been found in Italy, Sicily, Greece, and at Cyrené. They have the figure of Athené on one side and a design indicating the contest for which they are awarded on the other. Most of them belong to the fourth century B.C., 367-318; the so-called “Burgon Vase,” in the British Museum, to the sixth century. The tribe whose ships had been victorious received a sum of money, part of which was expended upon a sacrifice to Poseidon.</p>
 <p>The culminating-point of the festival was the 28th day of the month, the birthday of the goddess, when the grand procession carried through the city the costly, embroidered, saffron-coloured garment, the <seg lang="la">peplus</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πέπλος</foreign>). This had been woven in the preceding nine months by Attic maidens and matrons, and was embroidered with representations from the battle of the gods and giants. It was carried through the city, first of all, as a sail for a ship moving on wheels, and was then taken to the Acropolis, where it adorned one of the statues of Athené Polias. The procession is represented in a vivid manner in the well-known frieze of the Parthenon. It included the priests and their attendants, leading a long train of animals festally adorned for sacrifice; matrons and maidens bearing in baskets the various sacrificial implements (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscanephorus">Canephori</ref>); old men in festal attire, with olive-branches in their hands, whence came their name, <foreign lang="greek">θαλλοφόροι</foreign>; warriors, with spear and shield, in splendid array; young men in armour; the cavalry under the command of both the <foreign lang="greek">ἵππαρχοι</foreign>; the victors in the immediately preceding contests; the festal embassies of other States, especially of the colonies; and, lastly, the aliens resident in Athens. Of these last the men bore behind the citizens trays with sacrificial cakes, the women water-pots, and the maidens sunshades and stools for the citizens' wives; while on the freedmen was laid the duty of adorning with oak-leaves the market-places and streets through which the procession moved. The feast ended with the great festal sacrifice of a hecatomb of oxen, and with the general banqueting which accompanied it. At the yearly minor Panathenaea, on the 28th and 29th of Hecatombaeon, contests, sacrifices, and a procession took place, but all in a more simple style, under the direction of the <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshieropoei">Hieropoei</ref>.) In later times the festival was removed to the spring, perhaps in consequence of Roman influence, in order to make it correspond to the <ref type="cross" target="crossquinquatrus">Quinquatrus</ref> (q.v.) of Minerva.

<head orig="Pancratium">Pancratium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παγκράτιον</foreign>). The combination of boxing and wrestling in Greek gymnastics, getting 
<pb n="1166" /><cb /> its name from the fact that it called into play all the powers (<foreign lang="greek">πᾶν</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">κράτος</foreign>) of the fighter. At Sparta the name was applied to any rough, irregular fighting that was not conducted according to any rules, but in which even biting and scratching were not uncommon. The Greeks ascribed the invention of the pancratium to Theseus, who thus fought against the Minotaur. (See the Schol. on  <bibl n="Pind. N. 5. 49" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>v. 49</bibl>; and <ref type="cross" target="crosstheseus">Theseus</ref>.) It made its way into the four great games of Greece, and there was a pancratium for boys as well as for men (Pausan. v. 8 <hi rend="italic">fin.</hi>). It was fought partly standing and partly on the ground, and the boxing was the chief feature of it ( <bibl n="Pind.

The <seg lang="la">caestus</seg> (q. v.) was not used, however, and the blows were given, not with the closed fist, but with the hands curved, as in the second illustration. When two <foreign lang="greek">παγκρατιασταί</foreign> began to fight, they stood with outstretched arms, <figure id="fig.01166.2"><head>Pancratium. (Krause, <title>Gymnastik.</title>) </head></figure> feeling for an opening, and each tried to get the other into such a position as to have the sun shine in his eyes. With the clinch the real fight began. Biting and butting were against the rules (Lucian, <bibl n="Luc. Demon. 47" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Demon.</title>47</bibl>). The victory was not decided until one of the combatants was killed, or held up a finger in token of defeat ( <title>Imag.</title> ii. 6).</p>
 <p>At Rome the pancratium is first mentioned in the time of Caligula (Dio Cass. lix. 13), and it soon became very popular.</p>

From her perfection of loveliness and intellect she was called Pandora, “the All-gifted.” She became the wife of Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, though Epimetheus had been advised to accept nothing that came from Zeus. In the house of Epimetheus stood a closed box or jar containing all the evils possible for man; and this box Pandora out of curiosity opened. The evils poured out when the lid was raised, and though she closed it hastily, she only succeeded in preventing the escape of Hope, which was also in the box (Hesiod. <title>Theog.</title> 571; <bibl n="Cic.

This oration had reference to the feast itself, or was intended to inspire the assembled multitude with emulation by praising the great deeds of their ancestors, and also to urge them to unanimous co-operation against their common foes. The most famous compositions of this kind which have been preserved are the <title>Panegyricus</title> and <title>Panathenaïcus</title> of Isocrates, neither of which, however, was actually delivered in public. In later times eulogies upon individuals were so named. This kind of composition was especially cultivated under the Roman Empire by Greeks and Romans. In Roman literature the most ancient example of this kind which remains is the eulogy of the emperor Trajan, delivered by the younger Pliny in the Senate, A.D. 100, thanking the emperor for conferring on him the consulate —a model which subsequent ages vainly endeavoured to imitate. It forms, together with eleven orations of Mamertinus, Eumenius, Nazarius, Pacatus Drepanius, and other unknown representatives of the Gallic school of rhetoric from the end of the third and the whole of the fourth centuries A.D., the extant collection of the <title>Panegyrici Latini.</title> Besides these we possess similar orations by Symmachus, Ausonius, and Eunodius.

 <p> A Roman province between the Danube and the Alps, separated on the west from Noricum by the Mons Cetius, and from Upper Italy by the Alpes Iuliae, on the south from Illyria by the Savus, on the east from Dacia by the Danube, and on the north from Germany by the same river.

 <p>The Pannonians (Pannonii) were probably of Illyrian origin. They were a brave and warlike people, and were conquered by the Romans in the time of Augustus (about B.C. 33). In A.D. 7 the Pannonians joined the Dalmatians and the other Illyrian tribes in their revolt from Rome, but were conquered by Tiberius after a struggle which lasted three years (A.D. 7-9). Pannonia was originally only one province, but was afterwards divided into two provinces, called Pannonia Superior and Pannonia Inferior.

<head orig="Panthēon">Pantheon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πάνθειον</foreign>, “all divine”) or <hi rend="bold">Panthēum.</hi> The Pantheon, the only ancient edifice at Rome whose walls and vaulting have been perfectly preserved. The original statues that adorned it have long ago been removed, but the mighty dome-like building with its vast colonnade attests better than any existing work the massive strength and splendour of the architecture of imperial Rome. The purpose for which the temple was first built is not known, but we learn from an inscription on the porch that it was erected by M. Vipsanius Agrippa in B.C. 27. (<hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Agrippa L. F. cos. tertivm fecit</hi>.) At a later time the name Pantheon was thought to mean “the temple of all the gods,” a notion which led Pope Boniface IV. to dedicate the building, in A.D. 609, as a Christian church to the memory of all the martyrs, under the name of <title>S. Maria ad Martyres</title> (now S. Maria Rotonda, or simply La Rotonda). The building had been already repeatedly enlarged in ancient times by Domitian, Hadrian, and last of all, in A.D. 202, by Septimius Severus and Caracalla. It consists of a circular structure, 140 feet 6 inches in height and inner diameter, with 
<pb n="1169" /><cb /> a portico 103 feet long formed by sixteen Corinthian columns 39 feet high. Eight of these in front supported a massive pediment, behind which rose another pediment of still higher elevation, resting against the square projection which connects the portico with the dome. The other columns divide the portico into three parallel portions, originally vaulted over. In the interior of the portico on each side of the entrance are two niches, which formerly contained colossal statues of Augustus and Agrippa. The massive walls of the great rotunda, which is completely circular in form, are divided by ring-cornices into two stories, an upper and a lower. Above these springs a cupola of concrete, of vaster dimensions than any that had been attempted in previous times. The diameter of this lofty cupola corresponds to that of the vast cylindrical building on which it rests. The walls of the latter are 19 feet thick. The interior of the cupola is divided into five rows of deeply sunk panels (<seg lang="la">lacunaria</seg>), 28 in each row. At its vertex an opening about 30 feet in diameter lights the whole of the interior. The gilt-bronze tiles of the roof were taken by the emperor Constans II. to Constantinople in A.D. 655. The remains of the costly marble wall-linings of the interior, which dated from the last restoration, and consisted of 56 compartments, divided by 112 Corinthian columns, and covered with white marble, porphyry, serpentine, and pavonazetto, were not carried off until 1747. In 1632 the great bronze tubes which supported the roof of the portico were melted down by Pope Urban VIII. (Barberini) to be cast into pillars for the <hi rend="italic">baldacchino</hi> in St. Peter's and into cannon for the castle of S. Angelo—which led to Pasquin's famous epigram, <title>Quod non fecerunt barbari fecerunt Barberini.</title> The Pantheon now contains the tomb of King Victor Emmanuel.

<div2 id="crosspantomimus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pantomīmus">Pantomimus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παντόμιμος</foreign>). The representation of a dramatic subject by dancing and rhythmic gesticulation alone, as practised by the Romans. It originated in the custom of the ancient Roman drama, of allowing one actor on the stage to make only the necessary movements of dancing and gesticulation, while another actor sang the recitative to the accompaniment of the flute. This recitative was called <seg lang="la">canticum</seg>, and was a monologue composed in rhythmical form. The illustrative dance <cb /> was raised to a separate, independent branch of art by Pylades and Bathyllus under Augustus, B.C. 22. There were comic and tragic pantomimes, but the latter variety prevailed on the stage of the Empire. The subjects were chiefly taken from tragedies founded on mythological love stories (e. g. those of Iupiter and Leda, of Mars and Venus, of Cinyras and Myrrha, etc.), and treated so that the chief situations were included in a series of <seg lang="la">cantica.</seg> All of these were represented by a single pantomimus, the dancer as well as the performer being designated by that name. He thus had to represent several characters, male and female, in succession, while a chorus, accompanied by flutes and other instruments, sang the corresponding song. The pauses necessary for the change of mask and costume for each successive part were apparently filled up with the recital of music by the chorus, which served to connect the chief scenes with each other. Because of the prominence given to dancing in them the pantomimes were known as <seg lang="la">fabulae salticae.</seg> In imperial times the best poets wrote them—e. g., Lucan and Statius ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 92</bibl>).</p>
 <p>It was only in the latest times of the Empire that women were employed in pantomime. Pantomime, aiming at sensual charm alone, went beyond all bounds of decorum in the representation of delicate subjects. As an understanding of the subtleties of the art required a cultivated taste, pantomime was specially favoured by the higher classes, while the <seg lang="la">mimus</seg>, with his buffoonery, was more pleasing to the multitude.

<div2 id="crosspapyrus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Papȳrus">Papyrus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πάπυρος</foreign>). Information as to the papyrus reed, celebrated in antiquity as providing material for writing, is obtained from the study of existing plants believed to belong to the same genus, and also from the statements of ancient writers.</p>
 <p>There are two species of the papyrus plant (<title>Cyperus Papyrus</title>, cf. <foreign lang="greek">κύπειρος</foreign>, “a reed”) recognized to-day. One, the <title>Cyperus Syriacus</title>, mentioned by Theophrastus as growing with the sweet-scented calamus on the borders of a Syrian lake, was transplanted to Sicily by the Arabs in the tenth century, and is found at the present time in various parts of that island. The other species is found in Nubia and Abyssinia. This is the descendant of the old Egyptian papyrus which was cultivated in antiquity in the delta of the Nile. Herodotus (ii. 92, 96) and Strabo (799 foll.) speak of papyrus as belonging to lower Egypt. Since, however, it has disappeared from what was anciently believed to be its home, it is probable 
<pb n="1171" /><cb /> that its presence there was originally due to transplanting and assiduous cultivation. These two species differ from each other mainly in the length of the stalk—that of the former growing much higher than that of the latter. Other minor differences are also noticeable.</p>
 <p>The most valuable description given by ancient writers is that of Theophrastus, the successor of Aristotle in charge of the Lyceum, in his <title>Historia Plantarum</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φυτῶν Ἱστορία</foreign>, iv. 8, 3). He describes the papyrus as growing along the Nile in water of about two cubits (three feet) in depth, with a root as thick as a man's arm and of ten cubits (fifteen feet) or more in length. This root, rising somewhat above the soil, sends forth slen<figure id="fig.01171">
<head orig="Papyrus Plant.">Papyrus Plant.</head>
</figure> der shoots into the mud. The stalks (<foreign lang="greek">πάπυροι</foreign>) are about four cubits (six feet) in height, and are of triangular shape. These bear no fruit, but produce a soft, hair-like tuft as a head. The roots are used for firewood and for making various articles of furniture. The papyrus itself (Theophrastus refers to the stalk) is put to many uses. Boats are made from it, and from the <foreign lang="greek">βίβλος</foreign> (the substance within the stalk) sails, mats, clothing, coverings, and ropes. The <foreign lang="greek">βιβλία</foreign> (<seg lang="la">chartae</seg>, or sheets made of <foreign lang="greek">βίβλος</foreign>) are most familiar to people of other lands. Above all, this plant is useful as a means of subsistence, since the inhabitants chew it either raw, boiled, or roasted, drawing the juice and rejecting the fibre.</p>
 <p> Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 13. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiii. 12</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H. N., 77</bibl> foll.) repeats the statements of Theophrastus, but enlarges his mere reference to <foreign lang="greek">βιβλία</foreign> into an extended account of the manufacture of paper from the papyrus plant. The following description is based upon the statements of Pliny ; but that author's general and unscientific treatment of his subject and the inaccuracies in the text have caused much uncertainty concerning various points.</p>
 <p>Paper was made from the pith or cellular tissue within the stalk. It was once believed that the material was the outer rind of the plant. The word <seg lang="la">liber</seg>, which refers to bark (once used for writing material), and Pliny 's use of <seg lang="la">philyrae</seg>, in his description of the thin strips of web-like material, are misleading. Pliny elsewhere describes <cb /> <seg lang="la">philyra</seg> as the inner bark of the lime-tree. Ulpian, of the third century A.D. (<title>Dig.</title> 32, 52), sets apart <seg lang="la">philyrae</seg> as of different material from <seg lang="la">chartae.</seg> Cassiodorus (sixth century), in his <title>Variae</title>, uses the following expressions, which show that the pith or inner tissue is designated: <seg lang="la">viscera nivea viventium herbarum mollities in medullis; bibula teneritudine spongeum lignum.</seg> This tissue was cut into strips (<hi rend="italic">schidae</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">σχίζειν</foreign>) or <seg lang="la">inae</seg> ( Fest. p. 104: <seg lang="la">ina quae pars chartae est tenuissima;</seg> p. 81<bibl n="Fest.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 4</bibl>: a <title>tenuitate inarum quas Graeci in chartis ita appellant</title>), which were made as broad and thin as possible. Those taken from the centre of the stalk were the best, while the quality became poorer the nearer the rind was approached. The strips (<hi rend="italic">schidae</hi>) were arranged in parallel lines upon a board (<seg lang="la">tabula</seg>) wet with Nile water. They were then moistened with paste and overlaid with strips placed at right angles. Thus <hi rend="italic">texitur</hi> is used of the process and <seg lang="la">plagula</seg> first of the unfinished page opposed to <seg lang="la">pagina</seg> the completed page, although both words afterwards were used for the page (<foreign lang="greek">σελίς</foreign>) of the roll. These two layers of strips were pressed closely together until they formed one sheet. The remainder of the process consisted in drying in the sunlight and polishing with a shell ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 209" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 209</bibl>) or some instrument of ivory. While the <seg lang="la">paginae</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">σελίδες</foreign>) might be used separately, they were regularly joined with others to form a roll (<seg lang="la">volumen</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">τόμος</foreign>). The chief defects which were to be avoided were roughness (<seg lang="la">scabritia</seg>), dampness (<seg lang="la">humor</seg>), spots (<seg lang="la">lentigines</seg>), and streaks (<seg lang="la">taeniae</seg>), running down the middle of the <seg lang="la">pagina</seg> and rendering the paper spongy. The paste used was made of flour and boiling water, with the addition of a little vinegar. Ordinary glue, or workman's paste (<seg lang="la">glutinum fabrile</seg>), was not useful for this purpose, as it made the paper brittle. Pliny states that the separation of the pith into strips was accomplished by the use of the needle (<seg lang="la">acu</seg>). It is a question whether broad and thin strips could be obtained by the use of a needle. Birt (<title>Antike Buchwesen</title>, p. 231) suggests that <seg lang="la">acu</seg> may be a translation of some Greek expression, as, perhaps, <foreign lang="greek">ὀξεῖ τινι ὀργάνῳ</foreign>. The language of Pliny , as commonly interpreted, indicates that the water of the Nile, when muddy, served as glue (<seg lang="la">turbidus liquor vim glutinis praebet</seg>). This is correct if <seg lang="la">glutinis</seg> is a genitive, but Birt shows that Pliny knew only <hi rend="italic">glutinum-i</hi>, and <seg lang="la">glutinis</seg> is then a dative; and the inference is that paste was used, and water served to make it effective in uniting the strips. Pliny also states that in making the roll the best sheets were placed first, while those of poorer quality were at the end of the roll. Such an arrangement was most natural, as the most durable sheets would be on the outside; and if a portion of the roll alone was used the best would come first.</p>
 <p>The manufacture of paper from papyrus belonged almost exclusively to Egypt and in particular to the city of Alexandria. One kind of paper, the Fanniana, was made in Rome, but the process was merely additional treatment of a paper manufactured in Egypt. Papyrus <seg lang="la">chartae</seg> differed in form, quality, and the care bestowed in preparation. The essential difference was that of form, as it will be seen that difference in form implied a difference in quality and care in manufacture. This form was determined by the breadth of the single sheet before it became part of a roll, 
<pb n="1172" /><cb />
 and not by the height of the page, as was once believed. The height varied from eight to thirteen inches (Birt, <title>Antike Buchwesen</title>, pp. 252-253). The breadth depended upon the number of <hi rend="italic">schidae</hi> which were placed side by side to form the lower layer of the <seg lang="la">plagula.</seg> The broader the page the greater the advantage both to writer and reader, as there was less interruption to the continuity of the writing. In bound books the strain comes upon the binding; in the rolls, however, the individual page must stand the strain. Hence, the poorer the quality the narrower the page, as the liability to tear was greater in the large sheets than in the small. The great object in manufacturing paper was the attainment of the greatest breadth (<seg lang="la">latitudo</seg>) and thinness (<seg lang="la">tenuitas</seg>) consistent with toughness (<seg lang="la">densitas</seg>) and strength. Whiteness (<seg lang="la">candor</seg>) and smoothness of surface (<seg lang="la">levitas</seg>) were also desirable in papyrus paper. Pliny mentions nine varieties of paper. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The Augusta. This was the best quality known in Pliny 's days, though previously the best quality had been called Hieratica. It was thirteen <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (nine and one-half inches) wide. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The Livia. This was of the same breadth as the former, though the quality was somewhat inferior to it. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The Hieratica. This name was given to the third quality in the time of the Empire, probably after the death of Augustus. It was eleven <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (eight inches) broad. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The Amphitheatrica. This was so called because of its being manufactured near the Amphitheatre of Alexandria. It was nine <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (six and one-half inches) broad. (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) The Fanniana. This was the Amphitheatrica remade in Rome into a finer and broader paper. It was ten <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (seven inches) broad. (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The Saïtica, from Saïs, in Egypt, was eight <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (five to six inches) broad. (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) The Taeniotica, named from a tongue (<foreign lang="greek">ταινία</foreign>) of land near Alexandria. It was sold by weight and not by quality. (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) The Emporetica, which had a rough surface, and was used as wrappingpaper. It was six <seg lang="la">digiti</seg> (four and three-eighths inches) wide. (<seg lang="la">i</seg>) The Claudia. The emperor Claudius made a combination of the first two qualities by placing strips (<hi rend="italic">schidae</hi>) of the first over those of the second, producing, thus, a new paper—better, in certain respects, than the Augusta. Claudius also increased the width until it reached a full Roman foot (eleven and one-half inches). The Claudia was preferred to all others, though the Augusta was still used for correspondence. The Claudia was of such a quality that both sides of the paper could be used (<seg lang="la">opisthographa</seg>). The usual custom was to write only on one side of the page (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 5</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 62</bibl>; Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> iii. 5, 17).</p>
 <p>For letters and documents single pages (<seg lang="la">paginae</seg>), termed <hi rend="italic">schidae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">schidulae</hi> ( <bibl n="Mart.  4. 89" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 89</bibl>), were used. However, even for these purposes, but particularly for books, a number of sheets were joined to form a roll (<seg lang="la">volumen</seg>). The length of these rolls varied from a few pages to a large number. The reading <hi rend="italic">vicenae</hi> in Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 13. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiii. 77</bibl>: <seg lang="la">numquam plures scapo quam vicenae</seg>) is corrupt. Birt suggests <seg lang="la">ducenae.</seg> Egyptian papyri have been found to vary in length from 70 to 140 feet. Birt considers 39 feet the average length of a classical book-roll. A roll containing the entire history of Thucydides, which required 578 pages, or a length of 265 feet, has been mentioned by the scholiast. In like manner a roll containing <cb /> the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> of Homer, and another, the <title>Odyssey</title> of Livius Andronicus, are said to have existed. On the other hand, one literary work might be separated into smaller rolls. The fourth book of the <title>Rhetoric</title> of Philodemus was arranged in two rolls, and the Homeric papyrus of Elephantiné contained only the twenty-fourth book of the <title>Iliad.</title> The size of the volume corresponded to the character of the contents. Letters and poetry were written on small rolls; history, on rolls of larger size (Isidor. <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 6. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>vi. 12</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The first page of the roll was termed <foreign lang="greek">πρωτόκολλον</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">protocollum</hi>); the last, <foreign lang="greek">ἐσχατόκολλιον</foreign> ( <bibl n="Mart.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.2</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 6</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 3</bibl>). The term <seg lang="la">macrocollum</seg>, employed by Cicero in designating the paper used by himself ( <title>Ad Att.</title> xiii. 25, xvi. 3), was applied in his time to the Hieratica and the finer grades of papyrus. Pliny 's statement ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 13. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiii. 80</bibl>, <title>Erat et cubitalis macrocollis</title>) means that the <seg lang="la">macrocolla</seg> might reach the breadth of a cubit (eighteen inches). To Pliny all kinds of paper superior in quality to the Saïtica were <seg lang="la">macrocolla.</seg> The writing was as a rule in columns, so that each page represented a column. The term <foreign lang="greek">σελίδες</foreign>, originally of the rowing-benches of a galley, then of the columns of writing, finally was used as equivalent to <seg lang="la">paginae.</seg> The portion of the roll which marked the joining of the sheets was not used. However, in public documents before Caesar, the writing ran across the combined sheets, not in <seg lang="la">paginis</seg>, but <seg lang="la">transversa charta</seg> (cf.  <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 56" default="NO"> Caes.56</bibl>). Among the Ravenna diplomata of the fifth to the tenth centuries there are papyri written <seg lang="la">transversa charta</seg> (Marini, <title>Pap. Dipl.</title>).</p>
 <p>The standard of measurement in a roll was the page (<foreign lang="greek">σελίς</foreign>, <seg lang="la">pagina</seg>), as this was closely related to the size of the roll. The number of pages was regularly marked at the end of the book, but in some cases each page was numbered. In other rolls the number of pages is found on the <seg lang="la">titulus.</seg> In estimating the contents of a roll, it was customary to use lines as a standard of reckoning, not chapters or pages. This method of reckoning is the so-called stichometry. The number of lines (<foreign lang="greek">στίχοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔπη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">versus</seg>) in prose-writing and of verses in poetry was given at the close of the writing. This <foreign lang="greek">στίχος</foreign> was the normal hexameter line of thirty-five letters on the average (Birt, p. 197), or sixteen syllables (Diels, <bibl n="Luc. Herm. 17." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Herm.</title>xvii.</bibl> p. 377 foll.). The normal hexameter verse required the broad papyrus, so that the lines of narrow pages were estimated only as parts of the normal line. Theopompus states the length of his orations as 20,000 <foreign lang="greek">ἔπη</foreign>, and of his historical works as of 150,000 <foreign lang="greek">ἔπη</foreign>; so the emperor Iustinian calculates 150,000 <seg lang="la">versus</seg> in his <title>De Confirmatione Digestorum.</title></p>
 <p>In making the rolls the last sheet was folded upon a strip of wood termed <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign> (cf. <seg lang="la">ad umbilicum adducere</seg>, “to finish a work,”  <bibl n="Hor. Epod. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Epod.</title>14</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Epod. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Epod., 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  4. 89" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 89</bibl>). The ends of the <seg lang="la">umbilicus</seg> were gilded ( <bibl n="Mart.  3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 9</bibl>), and the edges (<seg lang="la">frons</seg>) of the cylinder were polished (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 1, 13; <bibl n="Mart.  1. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 67</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  10" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 10</bibl>; <bibl n="Catul. 22.8" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. 22, 8</bibl>) and coloured (<seg lang="la">nigra frons</seg>) (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> i. 1, 8). The roll was stained with cedar-oil, as a protection against moths (Vitruv. ii. 9, 13; <bibl n="Mart.  3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 2</bibl>); in consequence, the roll had a yellow colour (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 1, 13). There was fastened to the roll a strip of parchment, which contained the title of the book. This was termed <seg lang="la">titulus</seg> or <hi rend="italic">index</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σίττυβος</foreign> =a strip of leather, or <foreign lang="greek">σίλλυβος</foreign>=an index). The 
<pb n="1173" /><cb />
 roll was usually enveloped in a parchment cover (<seg lang="la">membrana</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">διφθέρα</foreign>), outside of which the <seg lang="la">titulus</seg> hung. In the case of the papyri of Herculaneum the envelope itself was of papyrus. If several rolls belonged to the same work, it was customary to bind these in a bundle (<seg lang="la">fasces</seg>). In reading, the roll was held with both hands.</p>
 <p>There are in existence to-day Egyptian papyri of great age. (See illustration, p. 28.) The oldest, the Prisse papyrus, which is kept in Paris, is estimated as dating from 1800 to 2000 years B.C. The earliest Greek papyri in existence, containing the fragments of the <title>Antiope</title> of Euripides, date about the second century B.C. Others dating from the last century B.C. contain orations of Lycophron and Euxenippus.</p>
 <p>The earliest Latin papyri are those of Herculaneum, which certainly date from the early part of the first century A.D. After these come the deeds of Ravenna dating fifth-tenth century and papal documents of the eighth-tenth century. In 1752 there were discovered in the Villa Suburbana at Herculaneum a large number of blackened rolls which, though at first disregarded, were finally recognized as literary works. It was not until 1754 that any success was attained in opening the rolls. In that year a monk, Piaggio, unrolled what proved to be a portion of a work of Philodemus. (See De Jorio, <title>Officina de' Papiri, Real Museo Borbonico</title>, Naples, 1825.)</p>
 <p>In the forty-eight years following only seventeen rolls were opened. The authorities of Naples took little interest in the matter, and the first publication did not appear until 1793. In 1800, George IV., then Prince of Wales, sent Bishop Hayter to Italy to copy the papyri. Bishop Hayter was driven from Italy in the French war of 1806, but managed to save one hundred lead-pencil fac-similes and an engraving of the <title>Carmen Latinum.</title> These are preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The British Museum possesses several opened and unopened rolls. This library on papyrus was found to contain the works of Epicurean philosophers—Epicurus, Demetrius, Polystratus, Colotes, and particularly of Philodemus; also notes on Chrysippus, the There were found twenty-four Latin rolls all in one <seg lang="la">capsa</seg> (book-box). Of these Latin rolls only one, No. 817 (<title>Carmen Latinum de Bello Actiaco</title>), has been opened. (See page 1157.) As the larger number of the rolls appear to have been written by Philodemus, and as no rolls save the Latin are of later date than Philodemus, it is possible that the library originally belonged to him. The Latin rolls were probably a chance addition in the time of the early Empire to a library of an earlier date. Various opinions have been expressed as to the authorship of the <title>Carmen Latinum.</title> Varius or Rabirius, or a little-known Albinius, has at different times been mentioned as the author. It was, at any rate, the work of some insignificant poet of the early Empire.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παράβασις</foreign>). A characteristic, though not indispensable, part of the chorus in the Old Attic comedy. About the middle of the piece, when the action of the play had been developed up to a certain point, the chorus, which had up to this time turned towards the actors on the stage, now turned to the audience. This stepping forward towards the audience is itself also termed <hi rend="italic">parabasis.</hi> In this position they made an appeal to the public on behalf of the poet, who could thus give expression to his personal views and wishes, and offer advice, as well as explain the purport of his play, etc. This address stood wholly outside the action of the play. When the <hi rend="italic">parabasis</hi> was complete, which was seldom the case, it consisted of seven parts, partly spoken by the leader of the chorus, partly sung by the chorus. One of these parts was called the <hi rend="italic">parabasis</hi> in a narrower sense, and consisted chiefly of anapaestic tetrameters. One feature of the parabasis was the introduction of lines relating to topics of the day, which Professor Mahaffy has compared with the “topical songs” of the modern burlesque.

It therefore resembled our writ <seg lang="la">de lunatico inquirendo.</seg> If the suit was successful, the person against whom it was brought was inhibited from the further care of his property.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παρανόμων γραφή</foreign>). An indictment brought against any person who proposed or carried an unconstitutional <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign>, or <cb /> law, whether its unconstitutionality consisted in form, contents, or both together. Such was the proposal of Androtion to award a crown to the outgoing senators, though they had failed to build the required number of triremes. This was improper as not having first been submitted to the Senate (Demosth. <title>C. Androt.</title> p. 594. 5). A law was also unconstitutional if it contravened an existing law ( <title>De Myst.</title> 87). The indictment could also be brought against one who proposed laws that were generally inexpedient or contrary to public policy ( <bibl n="Poll.  8. 87" default="NO">Poll.viii. 87</bibl>). Any citizen might prefer the indictment, and if he declared on oath his intention of doing so this acted as a means of suspending the vote upon a proposed law; or if it had already been adopted, as a temporary suspension of its operation. If the indictment was sustained, the person proceeded against might suffer death or a fine, and his law was repealed; but if the person bringing the indictment failed to secure a fifth of the votes at the trial (as Aeschines did in his famous prosecution of Ctesiphon), he incurred a fine of 1000 drachmae and lost the right of instituting a similar prosecution in the future.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παράσιτος</foreign>, “table companion”). A word which among the Greeks denoted originally the priest's assistant, who, like the priest, received his support from the offerings made to the temple, in return for certain services. These services included the collection and care of supplies of corn due to the temple, assistance at certain sacrifices, and the preparation of the banquets connected with

<head orig="Paris">Paris</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πάρις</foreign>), also called <hi rend="bold">Alexander</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀλέξανδρος</foreign>). The second son of Priam, king of Troy, by his wife Hecuba. When his mother, being about to give birth to a son, had dreamed that she brought forth a torch which set all Ilium in flames, the soothsayer Aesacus declared that the child would prove the ruin of his country, and recommended its exposure (Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 298" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Andr.</title>298</bibl>;  <bibl n="Cic.  Div. 1. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Div.</title>i. 21</bibl>). As soon as born, the child was given to a servant to be left on Ida to perish. He obeyed, but, on returning at the end of five days, he found that a bear had been nursing the infant. Struck with this strange event, he took home the infant, reared him as his own son, and named him Paris. When Paris grew up he distinguished himself by his strength and courage in repelling robbers from the flocks, and the shepherds, in consequence, named him Alexander (“Man-protector”), or, according to the Greek form, <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλέξανδρος</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀλέξειν τοὺς ἄνδρας</foreign>). In this state of seclusion, too, he united himself to the nymph Oenoné, whose fate is elsewhere related. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossoenone">Oenoné</ref>.) Their happiness was soon disturbed. At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the goddess of Discord, who had not been invited to partake of the entertainment, showed her displeasure by throwing into the assembly of the gods who were at the wedding celebration a golden apple, on which were written the words <foreign lang="greek">Ἡ καλὴ λαβέτω</foreign>, “Let the beauty (among you) take me.” Heré, Athené, and Aphrodité laying claim to it, and Zeus being unwilling to decide, the god commanded Hermes to lead the three deities to Mount Ida, and to intrust the decision of the affair to the shepherd Alexander, whose judgment was to be final. The goddesses appeared before him, and each, to influence his decision, made him an alluring offer of future advantage, Heré by the promise of a kingdom, Athené by the gift of intellectual superiority and martial renown, and Aphrodité by offering him the fairest woman in the world for his wife. To Aphrodité he assigned the prize, and brought upon

 himself, in consequence, the unrelenting enmity of her two disappointed rivals, which was extended also to his whole family and the entire Trojan race.</p>
 <p>Soon after this event, Priam proposed a contest among his sons and other princes, and promised to reward the conqueror with one of the finest bulls on Mount Ida. Persons were sent to procure the animal, and it was found in the possession of Paris, who reluctantly yielded it up. The shepherd, desirous of obtaining again this favourite animal, went to Troy, and entered the lists of the combatants. Having proved successful against every competitor, and having gained an advantage over Hector himself, that prince, irritated at seeing himself conquered by an unknown stranger, pursued him closely, and Paris must have fallen a victim to his brother's resentment had he not fled to the altar of Zeus. This place of refuge preserved his life; and Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, struck with the similarity of the features of Paris to those of her brothers, inquired his birth and his age. From these circumstances she soon discovered that he was her brother, and as such she introduced him to her father and to his children. Priam, thereupon, forgetful of the alarming predictions of Aesacus, acknowledged Paris as his son, and all enmity instantly ceased between the newcomer and Hector. Not long after this, at the instigation of Aphrodité, who had not forgotten her promise to him, Paris proceeded on a voyage to Greece, from which the soothsaying Helenus and Cassandra had in vain endeavoured to deter him. The ostensible object of the voyage was to procure information respecting his father's sister Hesioné, who had been given in marriage by Hercules to his follower Telamon, the monarch of Salamis. The real motive, however, which prompted the enterprise, was a wish to obtain, in the person of Helen, then the fairest woman of her time, a fulfilment of what Aphrodité had offered him when he was deciding the contest of beauty. Arriving at Sparta, where Menelaüs, the husband of Helen, was reigning, he met with a hospitable reception; but, Menelaüs soon after having sailed away to Crete, the Trojan prince availed himself of his absence, seduced Helen, and bore her away to his native city, together with a large portion of the wealth of her husband. Hence ensued the war of Troy, which ended in the total destruction of that illfated city. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.</p>
 <p>Paris, though represented in general as effeminate and vain of his personal appearance, yet distinguished <cb /> himself during the siege of Troy by wounding Diomedes, Machaon, Antilochus, and Palamedes, and subsequently by discharging the dart which proved fatal to Achilles. Aphrodité took him under her special protection, and, in the single combat with Menelaüs, rescued him from the vengeance of the latter. On the capture of Troy, Paris was wounded by Philoctetes with one of the arrows of Heracles, and, falling ill, returned to Oenoné, whom he had so long before abandoned. Resenting her wrongs she refused to heal him, and he returned to Troy, where he died.

<head orig="Parmenĭdes">Parmenides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρμενίδης</foreign>). A Greek philosopher and poet, born of an illustrious family about B.C. 510, at Elea in Lower Italy. He was held in high esteem by his fellow-citizens on account of his excellent legislation, to which they ascribed the prosperity and wealth of the town; and also on account of his exemplary life. A “Parmenidean life” was proverbial among the Greeks (Cebes, <title>Tabula</title>, 2). Little more is known of his biography than that he stopped at Athens on a journey in his sixty-fifth year, and there became acquainted with the youthful Socrates. He is the chief representative of the Eleatic philosophy. Like his great teacher, Xenophanes, he also formulated his philosophical views in a didactic poem, <title>On Nature</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φύσεως</foreign>), the form of which was considered inartistic ( <title>Acad.</title> ii. 74). According to the proëm, which has been preserved (while we only possess fragments of the rest), the work consisted of two divisions. The first treated of the truth, the second of the world of illusion; that is, the world of the senses and the erroneous opinions of mankind founded upon them. In his opinion truth lies in the perception that existence is, and error in the idea that non-existence also can be. Nothing can have real existence but what is conceivable; therefore to be imagined and to be able to exist are the same thing, and there is no development; the essence of what is conceivable is incapable of development, imperishable, immutable, unbounded, 
<pb n="1177" /><cb /> and indivisible; what is various and mutable, all development, is a delusive phantom; perception is thought directed to the pure essence of being; the phenomenal world is a delusion, and the opinions formed concerning it can only be improbable.

They have been rendered into English hexameter by T.

<head orig="Parmenion">Parmenion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρμενίων</foreign>). (1) The son of Philotas, a distinguished Macedonian general in the service of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great. Philip held him in high esteem, and used to say of him that he had never been able to find more than one general, and that was Parmenion. In Alexander's invasion of Asia, Parmenion was regarded as second in command. At the three great battles of the Granicus, Issus, and Arbela, while the king commanded the right wing of the army, Parmenion was placed at the head of the left, and contributed essentially to the victory on all those memorable occasions. The confidence reposed in him by Alexander appears to have been unbounded, and he is continually spoken of as the most attached of the king's friends, and as holding, beyond all question, the second place in the State. But when Philotas, the only surviving son of Parmenion, was accused in Drangiana (B.C. 330) of being privy to the plot against the king's life, he not only confessed his own guilt, when put to the torture, but involved his father also in the plot. Whether the king really believed in the guilt of Parmenion, or deemed his life a necessary sacrifice to policy after the execution of his son, he caused his aged friend to be assassinated in Media before the latter could receive the tidings of his son's death. The death of Parmenion, at the age of seventy years, will ever remain one of the darkest stains upon the character of Alexander. It is questionable whether even Philotas was really concerned in the conspiracy, and we may safely pronounce that Parmenion had no connection with it.</p>

<div2 id="crossparodia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Parodia">Parodia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παρῳδία</foreign>). Parody, burlesque. Parody among the Greeks is ascribed by Aristotle to Hegemon of Thasos (<title>Poët.</title> ii. 5; Athen. 698 B), who flourished at the time of the Peloponnesian War, and is frequently cited by Athenaeus, who mentions his nickname of <foreign lang="greek">Φακῆ</foreign> or “Lentil.” His parodies are based upon the Greek epics which be burlesqued. Mention is especially made of his parody of the <title>Gigantomachia.</title> (See Athen. i. p. 5; iii. p. 108; ix. pp. 406-407; and Meineke, <title>Hist. Crit. Com. Graec.</title> pp. 214-215.) Another Greek, Matron of Pitana, wrote burlesques of Homer, from one of which Athenaeus has preserved a long fragment which parodies the beginning of the <title>Odyssey.</title> He flourished in the fourth century B.C. (See Athen. iv. pp. 134-137; Eustath. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Hom. pp. 1067<bibl n="Hom.  1571" default="NO">Hom., 1571</bibl>, etc., and the monograph by Moser, <title>Ueber Matron den Parodiker</title> in Daub and Kreuzer's <title>Studien</title>, vi. pp. 293 foll.). Matron gave a gastronomical turn to his fun, as the first line of the passage mentioned above plainly shows: <lb /><foreign lang="greek">Δει_πνα μοι ἔννεπε, Μου_σα, πολύτροφα καὶ μάλα πολλά</foreign>.</p>
 <p>In this he was followed by Archestratus of Gela, whose <foreign lang="greek">Ἡδυπάθεια</foreign> was afterwards translated into Latin by Ennius. Another famous Homeric parody is the <title>Batrachomyomachia</title> or “Battle of the Frogs and Mice,” commonly ascribed to Pigres. See <ref type="cross" target="crossbatrachomyomachia">Batrachomyomachia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The philosophical writers were parodied first by Timon of Phlius, a skeptic of the school of Pyrrho (about B.C. 280), who was a writer of very great ability. His parodies were known as <title>Silli</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σίλλοι</foreign>), a word of uncertain derivation, and were in three books, partly in dialogue, and written in hexameters in the epic style. They ridiculed the dogmatic philosophers, but also parodied the Homeric language, 
<pb n="1178" /><cb /> as in the following line in imitation of <title>Iliad</title>, ii. 484: <lb /><foreign lang="greek">Ἔσπετε νυ_ν μοι ὅσοι πολυπράγμονές ἐστε σοφισταί</foreign>.</p>
 <p>Some have ascribed the <title>Silli</title> to Xenophanes of Colophon as the originator whom Timon introduces in his dialogue, but of this there is no definite proof. These compositions by Timon were regarded by the Greeks as so important that commentaries were afterwards written on him, notably by Apollonides of Nicaea; and were imitated by various writers, such as Sotades, Blaesus, Salerias, and Sopater of Paphos. See Diog. Laert. ix. ch. 12; Brunck, <title>Analecta</title>, ii. pp. 67 foll.; Langenreich, <bibl default="NO"><title>Dissertationes Tres de Timone Sillographo</title> (Leipzig, 1720-21)</bibl>; Wölcke, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Graecorum Sillis</title> (Berlin, 1820)</bibl>; and F. Paul, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Sillis</title> (Berlin, 1821)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Burlesques of the dramatic writers were apparently first written by <ref type="cross" target="crossrhinthon">Rhinthon</ref> (q.v.) of Tarentum (or Syracuse), whose thirty-eight dramas parodied the classic tragedy and gave rise to the so-called <foreign lang="greek">ἱλαροτραγῳδία</foreign>, which became very popular among the Greeks of Southern Italy. Rhinthon belongs to the Ptolemaic period, and therefore lies beyond the domain of classic Greek literature; but the comedies of Aristophanes contain many scenes that are evidently written in mockery of the tragedians and that contain many touches of subtle banter.</p>
 <p>Among the Romans parody was early written, the most complete specimen that we have being the <title>Amphitruo</title> of Plautus, which is the only remaining model that we have of the Rhinthonic play. The burlesque epic is well represented in the pseudo-Vergilian  <title>Culex</title>(q. v.). Bucolic poetry was ridiculed in the <title>Antibucolica</title> of one Numitorius, who in them poked fun at Vergil's <title>Eclogues</title> ( <title>ad Ecl.</title> vi. 43). A line or two of these have been preserved—e. g. the following in ridicule of <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>i. 1</bibl>: <lb />Tityre si toga calda tibi, quo tegmine fagi?</p>
 <p>Parody flourished most, however, in the period of the decline. The first satire of Persius parodies a number of lines from the popular poetry of the day; and Juvenal occasionally amuses himself by burlesquing a Vergilian line, as in i. 25, which recalls  <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 1. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>i. 28</bibl>; and he often falls into the mock-heroic vein, as did Horace at times. (Cf. Hor. <bibl n="Enn.

 <p>In modern times burlesques of classical subjects were made popular by Scarron in his <title>Virgile Travestié</title>, which was the first of a number of such works, most of them, however, being very dreary.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρράσιος</foreign>). A famous Greek painter of Ephesus, who with Zeuxis was the chief representative of the Ionic school. He lived about B.C. 400 at Athens, where he seems to have received the citizenship. According to the accounts of ancient writers, he first introduced into painting the theory of human proportions, gave to the face delicate shades of expression, and was a master in the careful drawing of contours (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

His skill in indicating varieties of psychological expression could be appreciated in the picture 
<pb n="1179" /><cb /> representing the Athenian State or <foreign lang="greek">Δῆμος</foreign>, in which, according to ancient authors, he distinctly portrayed all the conflicting qualities of the Athenian national character. Another of his pictures represented two boys, one of whom seemed to personify the pertness, and the other the simplicity, of boyhood. His inclination to represent excited states of mind is attested by the choice of subjects like the feigned madness of Odysseus, and the anguish of Philoctetes in Lemnos. His supposed contest with Zeuxis is well known. The grapes painted by Zeuxis deceived the birds, which flew to peck at them; while the curtain painted by Parrhasius deceived Zeuxis himself (Pliny , ib. 65).

In earlier times the examination in trials for homicide was conducted by two <seg lang="la">quaestores parricidii</seg>, on whom it was also incumbent to bring the accusation before the comitia for trial. Sulla transferred the decision in all cases of parricide to a standing tribunal (see <ref type="cross" target="crossquaestio">Quaestio Perpetua</ref>), which had also to try cases of assassination and poisoning.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">παρθενίαι</foreign>). A word meaning literally “children of unmarried women,” but usually applied to a distinct class of citizens at Sparta after the First Messenian War. The tradition goes that after the Messenian War had lasted a number of years, the Spartan women sent an embassy to the camp to the effect that they were weary of so long an abstention from the pleasures of married life, and representing also that the State would suffer if the increase of population should cease. Their husbands, who had taken an oath not to return home until the Messenians were conquered, sent back all the young men who were in camp with permission to cohabit with the maidens at Sparta. The children thus begotten were called <foreign lang="greek">παρθενίαι</foreign>; and after the return of the army from the war, these were not treated as citizens, and therefore joined the Helots for a war against the ruling class. This, however, appearing impracticable, they migrated to Italy, where they founded the colony of Tarentum. (See Ephorus <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Strabo, vi. p. 279, and cf. the article <ref type="cross" target="crossepeunacti">Epeunacti</ref>.)

He was acquainted with Vergil, whom he taught Greek, and one of his poems is said to have been the model for the <title>Moretum</title> (q. v.); but he was more closely connected with the elegiac poet, Cornelius Gallus.

This is a collection of thirty-six prose stories of unhappy lovers, compiled from ancient poets, especially from those of the Alexandrian school.

Apart from the light which the work throws on the Alexandrine poets, of whose productions it contains fragments, it has a special interest as a precursor of the Greek novel.

<head orig="Parthĕnon">Parthenon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρθενών</foreign>, “the maiden's chamber”), particularly a temple of Athené Parthenos (the virgin goddess), especially that on the Acropolis of Athens, distinguished by the grandeur of its dimensions, the beauty of its execution, and the splendour of its artistic adornment; so that it is usually regarded as the most perfect specimen of Grecian architecture. There was an earlier temple of Athené immediately to the south of the Erechtheum (see plan under <ref type="cross" target="crossacropolis">Acropolis</ref>), and the foundations of a new temple were laid after the Persian War, probably in the time of Cimon. This temple was never completed; on the same site there was built a temple of less length, but greater breadth, which is usually called the Parthenon. It was built at the command of Pericles by the architects Ictinus and Callicrates. It took about five years in building, and was finished in B.C. 438. Its further adornment with sculptures in the pediments, and with metopes and frieze was completed under the direction of Phidias, who himself took part in the work. The temple, built wholly of Pentelic marble, is 65 feet high. The <foreign lang="greek">στυλοβάτης</foreign>, or platform, on which the columns stand, is 228 feet in length, and 101 feet in breadth (=225 X 100 in Attic feet, giving 9:4 as the ratio of length to breadth). Under the stylobate is the <foreign lang="greek">κρηπίδωμα</foreign>, or basis proper, formed of three steps resting on a massive substructure, 250 feet long and 105 feet broad, and founded on the rock at the highest part of the plateau of the Acropolis. The temple is peripteral, its walls being entirely surrounded by a colonnade of forty-six Doric columns, about 35 feet high, eight at each end, and fifteen on each side. The architrave from the first was adorned with ninety-two metopes sculptured in high relief. Shields and votive inscriptions were subsequently placed there by Alexander the Great, in B.C. 338 ( <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Alex.</title>16</bibl>).

 the battle of the gods and giants; on the south, that of the Centaurs and Lapithae; on the west, the victory of the Athenians over the Amazons; and on the north, the destruction of Troy. The sculptures of the eastern pediment represented the birth of the goddess, those of the western the strife of Athené with Poseidon for the possession of Attica. These pediments are 93 feet long, and 11 feet 4 inches high. The <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, or temple proper, is 194 feet long, and 69 1/2 feet wide, with six columns at each end, 33 feet in height. Opposite the outermost columns at each end are <seg lang="la">antae</seg>, formed by the prolongation of the side walls of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> (see plan under <ref type="cross" target="crossacropolis">Acropolis</ref>).

It was divided longitudinally into three parts by <figure id="fig.01180.2">
<head orig="From the Frieze of the Parthenon.">From the Frieze of the Parthenon.</head>
</figure> <cb /> two rows of nine columns each, and above these was a second row of columns forming an upper story. The central space was open to the sky (hypaethral). At its western end, under a protecting canopy, stood the statue of the goddess, wrought in gold and ivory, the masterpiece of Phidias (see <ref type="cross" target="crossathene">Athené</ref>, near the end). The western chamber of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> was fronted by a portico, and was called by the special name of the Parthenon. Within this smaller chamber were kept vessels for use in the sacred processions, with various small articles of gold or silver. Modern writers have hitherto generally identified this small chamber with the <foreign lang="greek">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign> (lit. back-chamber), which was used as the treasury, or State bank, of Athens; but it is held by Dörpfeld that this term should be confined to the corresponding chamber of the early temple south of the Erechtheum.</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages the temple was converted into a church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and then into a mosque, and remained in good preservation 
<pb n="1181" /><cb /> till 1687. In that year, during the siege of Athens by the Venetians, the building was blown up by a bomb which fell into a powder magazine that the Turks had stored there, and, with the exception of the two pediments, it was almost completely destroyed.

Their tactics, of which the Romans had fatal experience in their first wars with them, became so celebrated as to pass into a proverb. Their mail-clad horsemen spread like a cloud around the hostile army, and poured in a shower of darts; and then evaded any closer conflict by a rapid flight, during which they still shot their arrows backward upon the enemy.</p>
 <p>Under the Persian Empire, the Parthians, with the Chorasmii, Sogdii, and Arii, formed the sixteenth satrapy: under Alexander and the Greek kings of Syria, Parthia and Hyrcania together formed a satrapy. About B.C. 250 they revolted <figure id="fig.01181">
<head orig="Parthians. (From a Roman Coin.)">Parthians. (From a Roman Coin.)</head>
</figure> from the Seleucidae, under a chieftain named Arsaces, who founded an independent monarchy, the history of which is given under <ref type="cross" target="crossarsaces">Arsaces</ref>. During the period of the downfall of the Syrian kingdom, the Parthians overran the provinces east of the Euphrates, and about B.C. 130 they overthrew the kingdom of Bactria, so that their empire extended over Asia from the Euphrates to the Indus, and from the Indian Ocean to the Paropamisus, or even to the Oxus; but on this northern frontier they had to maintain a continual conflict with the nomad tribes of Central Asia. On the west their <cb /> progress was checked by Mithridates and Tigranes, till those kings fell successively before the Romans, who were thus brought into collision with the Parthians. After the memorable destruction of Crassus and his army, B.C. 53 (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscrassus">Crassus</ref>, p. 424), the Parthians threatened Syria and Asia Minor; but their progress was stopped by two signal defeats, which they suffered from Antony's legate Ventidius, in 39 and 38. The preparations for renewing the war with Rome were rendered fruitless by the contest for the Parthian throne between Phraates IV. and Tiridates, which led to an appeal to Augustus, and to the restoration of the standards of Crassus, B.C. 20; an event to which the Roman poets often allude in terms of flattery to Augustus, almost as if he had conquered the Parthian Empire. It is to be observed that the poets of the Augustan Age use the names Parthi, Persae, and Medi indifferently. <figure id="fig.01181.2">

 <p>The Parthian Empire had now begun to decline, owing to civil contests and the defection of the governors of provinces, and had ceased to be formidable to the Romans. There were, however, continual disputes between the two empires for the protectorate of the kingdom of Armenia. In consequence of one of these disputes Trajan invaded the Parthian Empire (A.D. 115-117), and obtained possession for a short time of Mesopotamia; but his conquests were surrendered under Hadrian, and the Euphrates again became the boundary of the two empires. There were other wars at later periods, which resulted in favour of the Romans, who took Selencia and Ctesiphon, and made the district of Osroëné a Roman province. The exhaustion which was the effect of these wars at length gave the Persians the opportunity of throwing off the Parthian yoke. Led by Artaxerxes (Ardshir), they put an end to the Parthian kingdom of the Arsacidae, after it had lasted 476 years, and established the Persian dynasty of the Sassanidae, A.D. 226. See <ref type="cross" target="crossarsaces">Arsaces</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssassanidae">Sassanidae</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Parthians were of Scythic origin, but during the more flourishing period of the Empire adopted many of the usages of Greek civilization, including the Greek language (as the official form of speech) and to some extent the Greek religion. As the Empire declined, however, this superficial cultivation wore off, and by the second century A.D. even the Greek language fell into total disuse.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παρύσατις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Παρυσάτις</foreign>). The daughter of Artaxerxes I. Longimanus, king of Persia. She was given by her father in marriage to her own brother Darius, surnamed Ochus, who, in B.C. 424, succeeded Xerxes II. on the throne of Persia. The feeble character of Darius threw the chief power into the hands of Parysatis, whose administration was little else than a series of murders. Four of the sons grew up to manhood. The eldest of these, Artaxerxes Mnemon, was born before Darius had obtained the sovereign power, and on this pretext Parysatis sought to set aside his claims to the throne in favour of her second son Cyrus. Failing in this attempt, she nevertheless interfered after the death of Darius, in B.C. 405, to prevent Artaxerxes from putting Cyrus to death, and prevailed upon the king to allow him to return to his satrapy in Asia Minor. After the death of Cyrus at the battle of Cunaxa (B.C. 401), she did not hesitate to display her grief for the death of her favourite son by bestowing funeral honours on his mutilated remains; and she subsequently succeeded in getting into her power all the authors of the death of Cyrus, whom she put to death by the most cruel tortures. She afterwards poisoned Statira, the wife of Artaxerxes. The feeble and indolent king was content to banish her to Babylon; and it was not long before he recalled her to his court, where she soon recovered all her former influence. Of this she availed herself to turn his suspicions against Tissaphernes, whom she had long hated as having been the first to discover the designs of Cyrus to his brother, and who was now put to death by Artaxerxes at her instigation (B.C. 396). She appears to have died soon afterwards. See Xen. <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>i. 1</bibl>;  <bibl n="Aesch.

He originated a new school, which was not immediately connected with any of the existing tendencies of art, but was founded on a careful study of nature and the masterpieces of earlier sculptors. It aimed above all things at correctness of form, combined with elegance of representation and a mastery of technique. Pasiteles chased in silver a representation of the infant Roscius ( <title>De Div.</title> i. 79), and executed an ivory statue of Iupiter for the temple dedicated by Metellus (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

 <p>A Roman historian born about B.C. 19 of a distinguished Campanian family. Entering the army, he accompanied Gaius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, on an expedition to the East (A.D. 2). Two years later he served with Tiberius in Germany, attaining the rank of military tribune and <seg lang="la">praefectus equitum.</seg> With Tiberius he remained for some eight years and became <seg lang="la">legatus </seg> (<title>C.

 <p>In the year 30, he wrote his history at the request of the consul M. Vinicius, and probably died in the following year. It is believed that he was executed because of his connection with <ref type="cross" target="crossseianus">Seianus</ref> (q.v.). The history is in two books, of which a portion is lost after the eighth section of the first book, and also the opening. The title of the work is <title>Historiae Romanae ad M. Vinicium Consulem Libri Duo.</title> It is a succinct compendium of universal history (with especial reference to the history of Rome), beginning with the settlement of Magna Graecia and extending to his own times. The latter portion of the narrative is more diffuse than the first part. His method is to seize upon the striking points of his subject and to dwell upon them, leaving less important events in abeyance. His treatment is therefore rather that of an annalist than an historian, and his style is unfinished. His facts are in the main trustworthy, but his fulsome praise of Tiberius detracts from the value of the narrative of his own times. The text is in a very unsatisfactory condition. Only one MS. survived to modern times, and was lost in the seventeenth century, after being copied by Beatus Rhenanus at Amerbach. There are editions of the text by Orelli <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1835)</bibl>; Kritz (annotated) <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1840)</bibl>; Haase <bibl default="NO">(2d ed.

<head orig="Patricii">Patricii</head>

 <p> (literally the relatives of the <seg lang="la">patres</seg>, or heads of families of the old tribes. [See <ref type="cross" target="crossgens">Gens</ref>.]). In the oldest times of Rome the actual citizens who constituted the <title>populus Romanus.</title> They were divided into three tribes—<title>Ramnes, Tities</title>, and <title>Luceres</title>, each consisting of ten <seg lang="la">curiae.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscuria">Curia</ref>.) The union of these latter formed the national assembly, the Comitia Curiata. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.) Besides these there were originally only <seg lang="la">clientes</seg>, settlers enjoying no legal rights, with the citizens for their protectors (or <seg lang="la">patroni</seg>). Afterwards, when a new element of the population, endowed with partial citizenship, called the <ref type="cross" target="crossplebs">plebs</ref> (q.v.), sprang up from the settlement of subjugated Latin tribes, the <seg lang="la">patricii</seg> stood in contrast to them as old citizens possessing full rights. Later, the plebeians received a fuller citizenship through the centurial constitution framed by Servius Tullius (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscenturia">Centuria</ref>), while they gained at the same time the right of voting in the Comitia Centuriata, composed of patricians and plebeians, together with the obligation of serving in the field and paying taxes, hitherto obligatory on the patricians alone. In contrast to the plebeians, the patricians thus formed a hereditary aristocracy, with the exclusive right to hold public offices, whether civil or religious. Nothing short of a decision by the Comitia Curiata could either remove any one from the patrician body or (on rare occasions) enrol a plebeian among the patricians. The contraction of marriages between patricians and plebeians was not allowed till B.C. 445. A violent struggle arose between the two parties, after the establishment of the Republic in B.C. 510, on the subject of the admission of the plebeians to State offices. This struggle lasted till B.C. 300, and the patricians were, step by step, forced to give up their exclusive right to one office after another. First of all, they had to give up the quaestorship (B.C. 409), then the consulate (367), the dictatorship (356), the censorship (351), the praetorship (338), and finally the most important priestly offices, the pontificate and the augurship (300). Only politically unimportant offices were left reserved for them, the temporal office of <cb /> <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi>, and the priestly offices of <seg lang="la">rex sacrorum</seg> and the three <seg lang="la">flamines maiores.</seg> The political importance which the patrician Comitia Curiata possessed, through its right to confirm the decisions of the Comitia Centuriata, was lost in B.C. 286. The Comitia Tributi, in which the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> had the preponderance, thus became the most important organ of the democracy.</p>
 <p>An aristocracy of holders of public offices was thus formed, consisting of the patricians together with the more important plebeian families. The members of such families, whether patrician or plebeian, were called <seg lang="la">nobiles.</seg> The number of patrician families dwindled greatly owing to the Civil Wars (on their number towards the end of the Republic, see <ref type="cross" target="crossgens">Gens</ref>). Caesar and Augustus increased them by introducing plebeian families, and subsequent emperors gave the patriciate as a distinction. Under Constantine the Great <seg lang="la">patricius</seg> became a personal title, which conferred a rank immediately below the consuls. The external distinctive marks of a patrician were the <seg lang="la">tunica laticlavia</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstunica">Tunica</ref>) and a peculiar sort of shoe (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscalceus">Calceus</ref>) adorned with an ivory crescent (<seg lang="la">lunula</seg>).

Patrocles held, both under Seleucus and Antiochus, an important government over some of the eastern provinces of the Syrian Empire. During the period of his holding this position, he collected accurate geographical information, which he afterwards published to the world; but though he is frequently cited by Strabo, who placed the utmost reliance on his accuracy, neither the title nor exact subject of his work is mentioned. It seems clear, however, that it included a general account of India as well as of the countries on the banks of the Oxus and the Caspian Sea. Patrocles regarded the Caspian Sea as a gulf or inlet of the ocean, and maintained the possibility of sailing thither by sea from the Indian Ocean (Strabo, ii. p. 69).

While still a boy Patroclus involuntarily slew Clysonymus, son of Amphidamas. In consequence of this accident he was taken by his father to Peleus at Phthia, where he was educated together with Achilles. He is said to have taken part in the expedition against Troy on account of his attachment to Achilles. He fought bravely against the Trojans until his friend withdrew from the scene of action, when Patroclus followed his example. But when the Greeks were hard pressed, he begged Achilles to allow him to put on his armour, and with his men to hasten to 
<pb n="1185" /><cb />
 the assistance of the Greeks. Achilles granted the request, and Patroclus succeeded in driving back the Trojans and extinguishing the fire which was raging among the ships. He slew many enemies, and thrice made an assault upon the walls of Troy; but he was suddenly struck by Apollo, and became senseless. In this state Euphorbus ran him through with his lance from behind, and Hector gave him the last and fatal blow. Hector also took possession of his armour. A long struggle now ensued between the Greeks and Trojans for the body of Patroclus; but the former obtained possession of it, and brought it to Achilles, who was deeply grieved, and vowed to avenge the death of his friend. Thetis protected the body with ambrosia against decomposition until Achilles had leisure solemnly to burn it with funeral sacrifices. His ashes were collected in a golden urn which Dionysus had once given to Thetis, and were deposited under a mound, where the remains of Achilles were subsequently buried. Funeral games were celebrated in his honour. Achilles and Patroclus met again in the lower world; or, according to others, they continued after their death to live together in the island of Leucé.

He was consul a second time in 216 with C. Terentius Varro. This was the year of the memorable defeat at Cannae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshannibal">Hannibal</ref>.) The battle was fought against the advice of Paulus; and he was one of the many distinguished Romans who perished in the engagement, refusing to fly from the field when a tribune of the soldiers offered him his horse.

He was one of the best specimens of the high Roman nobles. He would not condescend to flatter the people for the offices of the State, maintained with strictness severe discipline in the army, was deeply skilled in the law of the augurs, to whose college he belonged, and maintained throughout life a pure and unspotted character. He was elected curule aedile in B.C. 192; was praetor in 191, and obtained Further Spain as his province, where he carried on war with the Lusitani; and was consul in 181, when he conquered the Ingauni, a Ligurian people. For the next thirteen years he lived quietly at Rome, devoting most of his time to the education of his children. He was consul a second time in 168, and brought the war against Perseus to a conclusion by the defeat of the Macedonian monarch, near Pydna, on the 22d of June. Perseus shortly afterwards surrendered himself to Paulus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossperseus">Perseus</ref>.) Paulus remained in Macedonia during the greater part of the following year as proconsul, and arranged the affairs of Macedonia in conjunction with ten Roman commissioners, whom the Senate had despatched for the purpose. Before leaving Greece he marched into Epirus, where, in accordance with a cruel command of the Senate, he gave to his soldiers seventy towns to be pillaged because they had been in alliance with Perseus. The triumph of Paulus, which was celebrated at the end of November, 167, was the most splendid that Rome had yet seen. It lasted three days. Before the triumphal car of Aemilius walked the captive monarch of Macedonia and his children, and behind it were his two illustrious sons, Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Scipio Africanus the younger, both of whom had been adopted into other families. But the glory of the conqueror was clouded by family misfortune. <cb /> At this very time he lost his two younger sons; one, twelve years of age, died only five days before his triumph, and the other, fourteen years of age, only three days after his triumph. The loss was all the severer, since he had no son left to carry his name down to posterity. In 164 Paulus was censor with Q. Marcius Philippus, and died in 160, after a long and tedious illness. The fortune he left behind him was so small as scarcely to be sufficient to pay his wife's dowry. The <title>Adelphi</title> of Terence was brought out at the funeral games exhibited in his honour. Aemilius Paulus was married twice. By his first wife, Papiria, the daughter of C. Papirius Maso, consul 231, he had four children—two sons, one of whom was adopted by Fabius Maximus and the other by P. Scipio, and two daughters, one of whom was married to Q. Aelius Tubero, and the other to M. Cato, son of Cato the censor. He afterwards divorced Papiria; and by his second wife, whose name is not mentioned, he had two sons, whose death has been recorded above, and a daughter, who was a child at the time that her father was elected to his second consulship.</p>

<head orig="Pausanias">Pausanias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Παυσανίας</foreign>). (1) A Spartan of the Agid branch of the royal family, the son of Cleombrotus and nephew of Leonidas. Several writers incorrectly call him king; but he only succeeded his father Cleombrotus in the guardianship of his cousin Plistarchus, the son of Leonidas, for whom he exercised the functions of royalty from B.C. 479 to the period of his death. In 479, when the Athenians called upon the Lacedaemonians for aid against the Persians, the Spartans sent a body of 5000 Spartans, each attended by seven Helots, under the command of Pausanias. At the Isthmus, Pausanias was joined by the other Peloponnesian allies, and at Eleusis by the Athenians when he took command of the united armies, the other Greek generals forming his council. The allied forces numbered 110,000 men. Near Plataeae in Boeotia Pausanias defeated the Persians under Mardonius 
<pb n="1187" /><cb />
 and thus assured the independence of Greece. For his own reward, Pausanias received one tenth of the spoils ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 10</bibl>-85; <bibl n="Diod.  11. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xi. 29</bibl>-33).</p>
 <p>In the year 477 the Greeks sent out a fleet under Pausanias to drive the Persians from the islands. He attacked Cyprus and subdued the greater part, and then sailed to Byzantium, which he succeeded in taking. After this victory Pausanias began to aim at personal dominion for himself rather than success for his country, being evidently dazzled by his unbroken and brilliant successes. His ambition seems to have looked for a tyranny over the whole of Greece, and to have conceived the plan of securing the aid of the Persian king in the accomplishment of this design. Among the prisoners taken at Byzantium were some Persians connected with the royal family. These he sent to the king, with a letter, in which he offered to bring Sparta and the rest of Greece under his power, and proposed to marry his daughter. His offers were gladly accepted, and whatever amount of troops and money he required for accomplishing his designs. Pausanias now set no bounds to his arrogant and domineering temper. The allies were so disgusted by his conduct that they all, except the Peloponnesians and Aeginetans, voluntarily offered to transfer to the Athenians that pre-eminence of rank which Sparta had hitherto enjoyed. In this way the Athenian confederacy first took its rise. Reports of the conduct and designs of Pausanias reached Sparta, and he was recalled and put upon his trial; but the evidence respecting his meditated treachery was not yet thought sufficiently strong. Shortly afterwards he returned to Byzantium, without the orders of the ephors, and renewed his treasonable intrigues. He was again recalled to Sparta, was again put on his trial, and again acquitted. But even after this second escape he still continued to carry on his intrigues with Persia. At length a man, who was charged with a letter to Persia, having his suspicions awakened by noticing that none of those sent previously on similar errands had returned, counterfeited the seal of Pausanias and opened the letter, in which he found directions for his own death. He carried the letter to the ephors, who prepared to arrest Pausanias; but he took refuge in the temple of Athené Chalcioecus. The ephors stripped off the roof of the temple and built up the door; the aged mother of Pausanias is said to have been among the first who laid a stone for this purpose. When he was on the point of expiring, the ephors took him out lest his death should pollute the sanctuary. He died as soon as he got outside, B.C. 470. He left three sons behind him, Plistoanax, afterwards king, Cleomenes, and Aristocles. See Bulwer's unfinished novel, <title>Pausanias the Spartan.</title></p>
 <p>(2) Son of Plistoanax, and grandson of the preceding, was king of Sparta from B.C. 408 to 394. In 403 he was sent with an army into Attica, and secretly favoured the cause of Thrasybulus and the Athenian exiles, in order to counteract the plans of Lysander. In 395 Pausanias was sent with an army against the Thebans; but in consequence of the death of Lysander, who was slain under the walls of Haliartus, on the day before Pausanias reached the spot, the king agreed to withdraw his forces from Boeotia. On his return to Sparta he was impeached, and seeing that a fair trial was not to be hoped for, went into voluntary exile, and was condemned to death. He was living at Tegea in <cb /> 385, when Mantinea was besieged by his son Agesipolis, who succeeded him on the throne.</p>
 <p>(3) King of Macedonia, the son and successor of Aeropus. He was assassinated in the year of his accession by Amyntas II., 394.</p>
 <p>(4) A pretender to the throne of Macedonia, made his appearance in 367, after Alexander II. had been assassinated by Ptolemaeus. Eurydicé, the mother of Alexander, sent to request the aid of the Athenian general, Iphicrates, who expelled Pausanias from the kingdom.</p>
 <p>(5) A Macedonian youth of distinguished family, from the province of Orestis. Having been shamefully treated by Attalus, he complained of the outrage to Philip; but as Philip took no notice of his complaints, he directed his vengeance against the king himself. He shortly afterwards murdered Philip at the festival held at Aegae, 336, but was slain on the spot by some officers of the king's guard. Suspicion rested on Olympias and Alexander of having been privy to the deed; but with regard to Alexander, at any rate, the suspicion is probably totally unfounded. There is a story that Pausanias, while meditating revenge, having asked the sophist Hermocrates which was the shortest way to fame, the latter replied, that it was by killing the man who had performed the greatest achievements.</p>
 <p>(6) A celebrated Greek traveller and geographer, a native of Lydia. He explored Greece, Macedonia, Asia, and Africa; and then, in the second half of the second century A.D., settled in Rome, where he composed a <title>Periegesis</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περιήγησις</foreign>) or Itinerary of Greece in ten books. Book I. includes Attica and Megaris; II., Corinth with Sicyon, Phlius, Argolis, Aegina, and the other neighbouring islands; III., Laconia; IV., Messenia; V., VI., Elis and Olympia; VII., Achaea; VIII., Arcadia; IX., Boeotia; X. , Phocis and Locris. The work is founded on notes, taken on the spot, from his own observation and inquiry from the natives of the country, on the subject of the religious cults and the monuments of art and architecture. Together with these there are topographical and historical notices, in working up which Pausanias took into consideration the accounts of other authors, especially of Polemon (A.D. 150), poets as well as prose writers. Although his account is not without numerous inaccuracies, omissions, and mistakes, it is yet of inestimable value for our knowledge of ancient Greece, especially with regard to its mythology, folk-lore, and religious cults, but above all for the history of Greek art. The composition of his work, especially in the earlier books, shows little skill in plan, execution, or style, and, while accurate, shows that he did not grasp the distinction between legend and history.</p>
 <p>The best editions of Pausanias are those of Siebelis, 5 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1822-28)</bibl>; and Schubart and Walz, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1838-40; reprint by Teubner, Leipzig, 1862 and 1881)</bibl>.

<head orig="Pegăsus">Pegasus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πήγασος</foreign>). The celebrated winged horse, whose origin is thus related: When Perseus struck off the head of Medusa, with whom Poseidon had had intercourse in the form of a horse or a bird, there sprang from her Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus. The latter received this name because he was believed to have made his appearance near the sources (<foreign lang="greek">πηγαί</foreign>) of Oceanus. He ascended to the seats of the immortals, and afterwards lived in the palace of Zeus, for whom he carried thunder and lightning. According to this view, which is apparently the most ancient, Pegasus was the thundering horse of Zeus; but later writers describe him as the horse of Eos, and place him among the stars. Pegasus also acts a prominent part in the combat of Bellerophon against the Chimaera. In order to kill the Chimaera, it was necessary for Bellerophon to obtain possession of Pegasus. For this purpose the soothsayer Polyidus at Corinth advised him to spend a night in the temple of Athené. As Bellerophon was asleep in the temple, the goddess appeared to him in a dream commanding him to sacrifice to Poseidon, and gave him a golden bridle. When he awoke he found the bridle, offered the sacrifice, and caught Pegasus while he was drinking at the well Pirené. According to some, Athené herself tamed and bridled Pegasus, and surrendered him to Bellerophon. After he had conquered the Chimaera he endeavoured to rise up to heaven upon his winged horse, but fell down upon the earth. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbellerophon">Bellerophon</ref>.) Pegasus was also regarded as the horse of the Muses, and in this connection is more celebrated in modern times than in antiquity; for with the ancients he had no connection with the Muses, except producing with his hoof the inspiring fountain Hippocrené.</p>
 <p>The story about this fountain runs as follows: When the nine Muses engaged in a contest with the nine daughters of Pierus on Mount Helicon, all became darkness when the daughters of Pierus began to sing; whereas, during the song of the 
<pb n="1190" /><cb /> Muses, heaven, the sea, and all the rivers stood still to listen, and Helicon rose heavenward with delight, until Pegasus, on the advice of Poseidon, stopped its ascent by kicking it with his hoof. From this kick there arose Hippocrené, the inspiring well of the Muses, on Mount Helicon, which, for this reason, Persius calls <seg lang="la">fons caballinus.</seg> Others, again, relate that Pegasus caused the well to gush forth because he was thirsty. Pegasus is often seen represented in ancient works of art with Athené and Bellerophon.

He first appears in history about the beginning of the fifth century A.D., when we find him residing at Rome. In the year 409 or 410, when Alaric was threatening Rome, Pelagius, accompanied by his disciple and ardent admirer Caelestius, passed over to Sicily, from thence proceeded to Africa, and leaving Caelestius at Carthage, sailed for Palestine. The fame of his sanctity had preceded him, for upon his arrival he was received with great warmth by St. Jerome and many other distinguished fathers of the Church. Soon afterwards the opinions of Pelagius were denounced as heretical; and in A.D. 417 Pelagius and Caelestus were anathematized by Pope Innocentius. Their doctrines included a denial of the tenet of original sin; a belief in the possibility of a sinless life on earth; and a rejection of the teaching of the Church with regard to grace. Pelagius also believed in the freedom of the human will. The date and circumstances of his death are not known. A very few only of the numerous treatises of Pelagius have descended to us. They are printed with the works of St. Jerome. There are special monographs on Pelagius by Wiggers <bibl default="NO">(Eng. tr. Andover, 1840)</bibl>; Jacobi <bibl default="NO">(1842)</bibl>; Wörter <bibl default="NO">(1866)</bibl>; and Klasen <bibl default="NO">(1882)</bibl>.

<head orig="Pelasgi">Pelasgi</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πελασγοί</foreign>). A name given to the earliest (prehistoric) inhabitants of Greece. In Homer the name applied now to a people in Asia Minor dwelling near Ilium ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 840" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 840</bibl>), and now to people inhabiting various parts of Greece. Thus, Argos is called Pelasgian (id ii. 681), and the god worshipped at Dodona is the “Pelasgian” Zeus (id. xvi. 233). Pelasgians are also spoken of as dwelling in Crete (<title>Odyss.</title> xix. 177). Herodotus tells us that the earliest name that Greece bore was <foreign lang="greek">Πελασγία</foreign>, and ascribes a Pelasgic origin to some of the Greek peoples, as the Arcadians, Athenians, Aeolians, etc. (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 146" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 146</bibl>; vii. 94<bibl n="Hdt.  95" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 95</bibl>; viii. 44). He draws a definite distinction between the Pelasgi and the Hellenes proper, as being different in both race and language (i. 56, 58). Thucydides agrees with Herodotus, and goes a step further in identifying them with the Tyrrheni. He also mentions them as found in the island of Lemnos, on which see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossetruria">Etruria</ref>, p. 625.</p>
 <p>Modern scholars, in general, regard the Pelasgi as a prehistoric people, probably non-Aryan in their racial affinities, and possibly to be identified with the same branch as the Etruscans, who came to Greece from Asia at a period earlier than that of the Indo-European migration. Still others use the name as designating the Indo-Europeans before the time of their separation into Greeks and Italians. To them are usually ascribed certain religious cults, which are in their origin non-Hellenic, such as that of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscabeiri">Cabeiri</ref> (q.v.) and of Zeus at Dodona; and also the architectural remains popularly called Cyclopean.

<div2 id="crosspeleus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Peleus">Peleus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πηλεύς</foreign>). A king of Thessaly, son of Aeacus, monarch of Aegina, and the nymph Endeïs, the daughter of Chiron. Having been accessory, 
<pb n="1191" /><cb /> along with Telamon, to the death of their brother Phocus, he was banished from his native island, but found an asylum at the court of Eurytus, son of Actor, king of Phthia in Thessaly. He married Antigoné, the daughter of Eurytus, and received with her, as a marriage portion, the third part of the kingdom. Peleus was present with Eurytus at the chase of the Calydonian boar; but having unfortunately killed his father-in-law with the javelin which he had hurled against the animal, he was again doomed to be a wanderer. His second benefactor was Acastus, king of Iolcos; but here again he was involved in trouble through a false charge brought against him by Astydamia, or, as Horace calls her, Hippolyte, the queen of Acastus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacastus">Acastus</ref>.) To reward the virtue of Peleus, as fully shown by his resisting the blandishments of Astydamia, the gods resolved to give him a goddess in marriage. The spouse selected for him was the sea-nymph Thetis, who had been wooed by Zeus himself and his brother Poseidon; but Themis having declared that her child would be greater than his sire, the gods withdrew ( <title>Isth.</title> viii. 58 foll.). Others say that she was courted by Zeus alone till he was informed by Prometheus that, if he had a son by her, that son would dethrone him. Others, again, maintain that Thetis, who was reared by Heré, would not assent to the wishes of Zeus, and that the god, in his anger, condemned her to espouse a mortal; or that Heré herself selected Peleus for her spouse ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24. 59" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiv. 59</bibl>). Chiron, being made aware of the will of the gods, advised Peleus to aspire to the favour of the nymph of the sea, and instructed him how to win her. He therefore lay in wait, and seized and held her fast, though she changed herself into every variety of form, becoming fire, water, a serpent, and a lioness. The wedding was solemnized on Mount Pelion; the gods all honoured it with their presence, and bestowed armour on the bridegroom. Chiron gave him the famous ashen spear afterwards wielded by his son; and Poseidon bestowed on him the immortal Harpyborn steeds Balius and Xanthus. The offspring of this union was the celebrated Achilles. According to one account, Peleus was deserted by his goddess-wife for not allowing her to cast the infant Achilles into a caldron of boiling water, to try if he were mortal. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossachilles">Achilles</ref>.) This, however, is a post-Homeric fiction, since Homer represents Peleus and Thetis as dwelling together all the lifetime of their son. Of Peleus it is farther related that he survived his son and even grandson ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 11. 493" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xi. 493</bibl>), and died in misery in the island of Cos. It was at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis that the goddess of Discord threw the apple of gold into the middle of the assembled deities, with which was connected so much misfortune for both the Trojans and the Greeks.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πελίας</foreign>). A son of Poseidon and Tyro, a daughter of Salmoneus. Poseidon once visited Tyro in the form of the river-god Enipeus, with whom she was in love, and she became by him the mother of Pelias and Neleus. To conceal her shame, their mother exposed the two boys, but they were found and reared by some countrymen. They subsequently learned their parentage; and after the death of Cretheus, king of Iolcus, who <cb /> had married their mother, they seized the throne of Iolcus, to the exclusion of Aeson, the son of Cretheus and Tyro. Pelias soon afterwards expelled his own brother Neleus, and thus became sole ruler of Iolcus. After Pelias had long reigned over Iolcus, Iason, the son of Aeson, came to Iolcus and claimed the kingdom as his right. In order to get rid of him, Pelias sent him to Colchis to fetch the golden fleece. Hence arose the celebrated expedition of the Argonauts. After the return of Iason, Pelias was cut to pieces and boiled by his own daughters (the Peliades), who had been told by Medea that in this manner they might restore their father to vigour and youth. His son Acastus held funeral games in his honour at Iolcus, and expelled Iason and Medea from the country.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πελοπίδας</foreign>). A Theban general and statesman, son of Hippoclus. He was descended from a noble family, and inherited a large estate, of which he made a liberal use. He lived always in the closest friendship with Epaminondas, to whose simple frugality, as he could not persuade him to share his riches, he is said to have conformed his own mode of life. He took a leading part in expelling the Spartans from Thebes, B.C. 379; and from this time until his death there was not a year in which he was not intrusted with some important command. In 371 he was one of the Theban commanders at the battle of Leuctra, so fatal to the Lacedaemonians, and joined Epaminondas in urging the expediency of immediate action. In 369 he was also one of the generals in the first invasion of the Peloponnesus by the Thebans. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepaminondas">Epaminondas</ref>.) In 368 Pelopidas was sent again into Thessaly, on two separate occasions, in consequence of complaints against Alexander of Pherae. On his first expedition Alexander of Pherae sought safety in flight, and Pelopidas advanced into Macedonia to arbitrate between Alexander II. and Ptolemy of Alorus. Among the hostages whom he took with him from Macedonia was the famous Philip, the father of Alexander the Great. On his second visit to Thessaly, Pelopidas went simply as an ambassador, not expecting any opposition, and unprovided with a military force. He was seized by Alexander of Pherae, and was kept in confinement at Pherae till his liberation in 367 by a Theban force under Epaminondas. In the same year in which he was released he was sent as ambassador to Susa to counteract the Lacedaemonian and Athenian negotiations at the Persian court. In 364 the Thessalian towns again applied to Thebes for protection against Alexander, and Pelopidas was appointed to aid them. His forces, however, were dismayed by an eclipse of the sun (June 13), and, therefore, leaving them behind, he took with him into Thessaly only three hundred horse. On his arrival at Pharsalus he collected a force which he deemed sufficient, and marched against Alexander, treating lightly the great disparity of numbers, and remarking that it was better as it was, since there would be more for him to conquer. At Cynoscephalae a battle ensued, in which Pelopidas drove the enemy from their ground, but he himself was slain as, burning with resentment, he pressed rashly forward to attack Alexander in person. The Thebans and Thessalians made great lamentations for his death, and the latter, having earnestly requested leave to bury him, celebrated his funeral with extraordinary splendour. <cb />

<div2 id="crosspeloponnesian-war" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</head>

 <p> A name given to the great contest between Athens and her allies on the one side, and the Peloponnesian confederacy, headed by Sparta, on the other, which lasted from B.C. 431 to 404. The war, which is one of the most memorable and epoch-making in the history of Europe, was a consequence of the jealousy with which Sparta and Athens regarded each other, as States each of which was aiming at supremacy in Greece, as the heads respectively of the Dorian and Ionian races, and as patrons of the two opposite forms of civil government, oligarchy and democracy. The war was eagerly desired by a strong party in each of those States, but it was necessary to find an occasion for commencing hostilities, especially as a truce for thirty years had been concluded between Athens and Sparta in the year B.C. 445. Such an occasion was presented by the affairs of Corcyra and Potidaea. In a quarrel, which soon became a war, between Corinth and Corcyra, respecting Epidamnus, a colony of the latter State (B.C. 436), the Corcyreans applied to Athens for assistance. Their request was granted, as far as the conclusion of a defensive alliance between Athens and Corcyra, and an Athenian fleet was sent to their aid, which, however, soon engaged in active hostilities against the Corinthians. Potidaea, on the isthmus of Pallené, was a Corinthian colony, and, even after its subjection to Athens, continued to receive every year from Corinth certain functionaries or officers (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδημιουργοί</foreign>). The Athenians, suspecting that the Potidaeans were inclined to join in a revolt, to which Perdiccas, king of Macedon, was instigating the towns of Chalcidicé, required them to dismiss the Corinthian functionaries, and to give other pledges of their fidelity. The Potidaeans refused, and, with most of the other Chalcidian towns, revolted from Athens and received aid from Corinth. The Athenians sent an expedition against them, and, after defeating them in battle, laid siege to Potidaea (B.C. 432). The Corinthians now obtained a meeting of the Peloponnesian confederacy at Sparta, in which they complained of the conduct of Athens with regard to Corcyra and Potidaea. After others of the allies had brought their charges against Athens, and after some of the Athenian envoys, who happened to be in the city, had defended the conduct of their State, the Spartans first, and afterwards all the allies, decided that Athens had broken the truce, and they resolved upon immediate war; King Archidamus alone recommended some delay.</p>
 <p>In the interval necessary for preparation, an attempt was made to throw the blame of commencing hostilities upon the Athenians by sending three several embassies to Athens with demands of such a nature as could not be accepted. In the assembly which was held at Athens to give a final answer to these demands, Pericles, who was now at the height of his power, urged the people to engage in the war, and laid down a plan for the conduct of it. He advised the people to bring all their movable property from the country into the city, to abandon Attica to the ravages of the enemy, and not to suffer themselves to be provoked to give them battle with inferior numbers, but to expend all their strength upon their navy, which might be employed in carrying the war into the enemy's territory, and in collecting supplies from subject States; and further, not to attempt any new conquest 
<pb n="1193" /><cb /> while the war lasted. His advice was adopted, and the Spartan envoys were sent home with a refusal of their demands, but with an offer to refer the matters in difference to an impartial tribunal, an offer which the Lacedaemonians had no intention of accepting. After this the usual peaceful intercourse between the rival States was discontinued. Thucydides (ii. 1) dates the beginning of the war from the early spring of the year B.C. 431, the fifteenth of the thirty years' truce, when a party of Thebans made an attempt, which at first succeeded, but was ultimately defeated, to surprise Plataea.</p>
 <p>The truce being thus openly broken, both parties addressed themselves to the war. The Peloponnesian confederacy included all the States of Peloponnesus except Achaia (which joined them afterwards) and Argos, and without the Peloponnesus, Megaris, Phocis, Locris, Boeotia, the island of Leucas, and the cities of Ambracia and Anactorium. The allies of the Athenians were Chios and Lesbos, besides Samos and the other islands of the Aegaean which had been reduced to subjection (Thera and Melos, which were still independent, remained neutral), Plataea, the Messenian colony in Naupactus, the majority of the Acarnanians, Corcyra, Zacynthus, and the Greek colonies in Asia Minor, in Thrace and Macedonia, and on the Hellespont. The resources of Sparta lay chiefly in her land forces, which, however, consisted of contingents from the allies, whose period of service was limited; the Spartans were also deficient in money. The Athenian strength lay in the fleet, which was manned chiefly by foreign sailors, whom the wealth collected from the allies enabled them to pay. Thucydides informs us that the cause of the Lacedaemonians was the more popular, as they professed to be deliverers of Greece, while the Athenians were fighting in defence of a dominion which had become odious through their tyranny, and to which the States which yet retained their independence feared to be brought into subjection.</p>
 <p>In the summer of the year B.C. 431 the Peloponnesians invaded Attica under the command of Archidamus, king of Sparta. Their progress was slow, as Archidamus appears to have been still anxious to try what could be done by intimidating the Athenians before proceeding to extremities. Yet their presence was found to be a greater calamity than the people had anticipated; and when Archidamus made his appearance at Acharnae, they began loudly to demand to be led out to battle. Pericles firmly adhered to his plan of defence, and the Peloponnesians returned home. Before their departure the Athenians had sent out a fleet of a hundred sail, which was joined by fifty Corcyrean ships, to waste the coasts of Peloponnesus; and towards the autumn Pericles led the whole disposable force of the city into Megaris, which he laid waste. In the same summer the Athenians expelled the inhabitants of Aegina from their island, which they colonized with Athenian settlers. In the winter there was a public funeral at Athens for those who had fallen in the war, and Pericles pronounced over them an oration, the substance of which is preserved by Thucydides (ii. 35-46). In the following summer (B.C. 430) the Peloponnesians again invaded Attica under Archidamus, who now entirely laid aside the forbearance which he had shown the year before, and left <cb /> scarcely a corner of the land unravaged. This invasion lasted forty days. In the meantime, a grievous pestilence broke out in Athens, and raged with the more virulence on account of the crowded state of the city. Of this terrible visitation Thucydides, who was himself a sufferer, has left a minute and apparently faithful description (ii. 46 foll.). The murmurs of the people against Pericles were renewed, and he was compelled to call an assembly to defend his policy. He succeeded so far as to prevent any overtures for peace being made to the Lacedaemonians, but he himself was fined, though immediately afterwards he was reëlected general. While the Peloponnesians were in Attica, Pericles led a fleet to ravage the coasts of Peloponnesus. In the winter of this year Potidaea surrendered to the Athenians on favourable terms ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 70" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 70</bibl>). The next year (B.C. 429), instead of invading Attica, the Peloponnesians laid siege to Plataea. The brave resistance of the inhabitants forced their enemies to convert the siege into a blockade. In the same summer, an invasion of Acarnania by the Ambracians and a body of Peloponnesian troops was repulsed; and a large Peloponnesian fleet, which was to have joined in the attack on Acarnania, was twice defeated by Phormion in the mouth of the Corinthian Gulf. An expedition sent by the Athenians against the revolted Chalcidian towns was defeated with great loss.</p>
 <p>In the preceding year (B.C. 430) the Athenians had concluded an alliance with Sitalces, king of the Odrysae in Thrace, and Perdiccas, king of Macedon, on which occasion Sitalces had promised to aid the Athenians to subdue their revolted subjects in Chalcidicé. He now collected an army of 150,000 men, with which he first invaded Macedonia, to revenge the breach of certain promises which Perdiccas had made to him the year before, and afterwards laid waste the territory of the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans, but he did not attempt to reduce any of the Greek cities. About the middle of this year Pericles died. The invasion of Attica was repeated in the next summer (B.C. 428), and immediately afterwards all Lesbos except Methymné revolted from the Athenians, who laid siege to Mitylené. The Mitylenaeans begged aid from Sparta, which was promised, and they were admitted into the Spartan alliance. In the same winter a body of Plataeans, amounting to 220, made their escape from the besieged city in the night, and took refuge in Athens. In the summer of B.C. 427 the Peloponnesians again invaded Attica, while they sent a fleet of forty-two galleys, under Alcidas, to the relief of Mitylené. Before the fleet arrived Mitylené had surrendered, and Alcidas, after a little delay, sailed home. In an assembly which was held at Athens to decide on the fate of the Mitylenaeans, it was resolved, at the instigation of Cleon, that all the adult citizens should be put to death, and the women and children made slaves; but this barbarous decree was repealed the next day. The land of the Lesbians (except Methymné) was seized and divided among Athenian citizens, to whom the inhabitants paid a rent for the occupation of their former property. In the same summer the Plataeans surrendered; they were massacred, and their city was given up to the Thebans, who razed it to the ground. In the year B.C. 426 the Lacedaemonians were deterred from invading Attica by earthquakes. An expedition against Aetolia, under the 
<pb n="1194" /><cb /> Athenian general Demosthenes, completely failed; but afterwards Demosthenes and the Acarnanians routed the Ambracians, who nearly all perished. In the winter (B.C. 426-425) the Athenians purified the island of Delos, as an acknowledgment to Apollo for the cessation of the plague.</p>
 <p>At the beginning of the summer of B.C. 425 the Peloponnesians invaded Attica for the fifth time. At the same time the Athenians, who had long directed their thoughts towards Sicily, sent a fleet to aid the Leontini in a war with Syracuse. Demosthenes accompanied this fleet, in order to act, as occasion might offer, on the coast of Peloponnesus. He fortified Pylus on the coast of Messenia, the northern headland of the modern Bay of Navarino. In the course of the operations which were undertaken to dislodge him, a body of Lacedaemonians, including several noble Spartans, got blockaded in the island of Sphacteria, at the mouth of the bay, and were ultimately taken prisoners by Cleon and Demosthenes. Pylus was garrisoned by a colony of Messenians, in order to annoy the Spartans. After this event the Athenians engaged in vigorous offensive operations, of which the most important was the capture of the island of Cythera by Nicias early in B.C. 424. This summer, however, the Athenians suffered some reverses in Boeotia, where they lost the battle of Delium, and on the coasts of Macedonia and Thrace, where Brasidas, among other exploits, took Amphipolis. The Athenian expedition to Sicily was abandoned, after some operations of no great importance, in consequence of a general pacification of the island, which was effected through the influence of Hermocrates, a citizen of Syracuse. In the year B.C. 423 a year's truce was concluded between Sparta and Athens, with a view to a lasting peace. Hostilities were renewed in B.C. 422, and Cleon was sent to cope with Brasidas, who had continued his operations even during the truce. A battle was fought between these generals at Amphipolis, in which the defeat of the Athenians was amply compensated by the double deliverance which they experienced in the death both of Cleon and Brasidas. In the following year (B.C. 421) Nicias succeeded in negotiating a peace with Sparta for fifty years, the terms of which were a mutual restitution of conquests made during the war and the release of the prisoners taken at Sphacteria. This treaty was ratified by all the allies of Sparta except the Boeotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megarians. This peace never rested on any firm basis. It was no sooner concluded than it was discovered that Sparta had not the power to fulfil her promises, and Athens insisted on their performance. The jealousy of the other States was excited by a treaty of alliance which was concluded between Sparta and Athens immediately after the peace, and intrigues were commenced for the formation of a new confederacy, with Argos at the head. An attempt was made to draw Sparta into alliance with Argos, but it failed. A similar overture subsequently made to Athens met with better success, chiefly through an artifice of Alcibiades, who was at the head of a large party hostile to the peace, and the Athenians concluded a treaty offensive and defensive with Argos, Elis, and Mantinea for one hundred years (B.C. 420). In the year B.C. 418 the Argive confederacy was broken up by their defeat at the battle of Mantinea, and a peace, and soon after an alliance, was made between Sparta <cb /> and Argos. In the year B.C. 416 an expedition was undertaken by the Athenians against Melos, which had hitherto remained neutral. The Melians surrendered at discretion; all the males who had attained manhood were put to death; the women and children were made slaves; and subsequently five hundred Athenian colonists were sent to occupy the island ( <bibl n="Thuc.  5. 116" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.v. 116</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The fifty years' peace was not considered at an end, though its terms had been broken on both sides, till the year B.C. 415, when the Athenians undertook their daring and tragic expedition to Sicily. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssyracusae">Syracusae</ref>.) Sicily proved a rock against which their resources and efforts were fruitlessly expended. And Sparta, which furnished but a commander and a handful of men for the defence of Syracuse, soon beheld her antagonist reduced, by a series of unparalleled misfortunes, to a state of the utmost distress and weakness. The accustomed procrastination of the Spartans, and the timid policy to which they ever adhered, alone preserved Athens in this critical moment, or at least retarded her downfall. Time was allowed for her citizens to recover from the panic and consternation occasioned by the news of the Sicilian disaster; and instead of viewing hostile fleets, as they had anticipated, ravaging their coasts and blockading the Piraeus, they were enabled still to dispute the empire of the sea and to preserve the most valuable of their dependencies. Alcibiades, whose exile had proved so injurious to his country, since it was to his counsels alone that the successes of her enemies are to be attributed, now interposed in her behalf, and by his intrigues prevented the Persian satrap, Tissaphernes, from placing at the disposal of the Spartan admiral that superiority of force which must at once have terminated the war by the complete overthrow of the Athenian Republic ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8." default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii.</bibl>). The temporary revolution which was effected at Athens by his contrivance also, and which placed the State at variance with the fleet and army stationed at Samos, afforded him another opportunity of rendering a real service to his country by moderating the violence and animosity of the latter. The victory of Cynossema and the subsequent successes of Alcibiades, now elected to the chief command of the forces of his country, once more restored Athens to the command of the sea, and, had she reposed that confidence in the talents of her generals which they deserved and her necessities required, the efforts of Sparta and the gold of Persia might have proved unavailing. But the second exile of Alcibiades, and, still more, the iniquitous sentence which condemned to death the generals who fought and conquered at Arginusae, sealed the fate of Athens; and the battle of Aegos Potamos at length terminated a contest which had been carried on, with scarcely any intermission, during a period of twenty-seven years, with a spirit and animosity unparalleled in the annals of warfare. Lysander now sailed to Athens, receiving as he went the submission of the allies, and blockaded the city, which surrendered after a few months (B.C. 404) on terms dictated by Sparta, with a view of making Athens a useful ally by giving the ascendency in the State to the oligarchical party.</p>
 <p>The history of the Peloponnesian War was written by Thucydides, upon whose accuracy and impartiality, as far as his narrative goes, we may place the fullest dependence. His history ends 
<pb n="1195" /><cb /> abruptly in the year B.C. 411. For the rest of the war we have to follow Xenophon and Diodorus. The value of Xenophon's history is impaired by his prejudice, and that of Diodorus by his carelessness.

<div2 id="crosspeloponnesus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Peloponnēsus">Peloponnesus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πελοπόννησος</foreign>). Now the Morea; the southern part of Greece, or the peninsula, which was connected with Hellas proper by the isthmus of Corinth. It is said to have derived its name—Peloponnesus, or the “island of Pelops”— from the mythical Pelops. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspelops">Pelops</ref>.) This name does not occur in Homer. In his time the peninsula was sometimes called Apia, from Apis, son of Phoroneus, king of Argos, and sometimes Argos, which names were given to it on account of Argos being the chief power in Peloponnesus at that period. On the east and south there are three great gulfs—the Argolic, Laconian, and Messenian. The ancients compared the shape of the country to the leaf of a plane-tree; and its modern name, the Morea, which first occurs in the twelfth century of the Christian era, was given to it on account of its resemblance to a mulberry-leaf. Peloponnesus was divided into various provinces, all of which were bounded on one side by the sea, with the exception of Arcadia, which was in the centre of the country. These provinces were Achaia in the north, Elis in the west, Messenia in the west and south, Laconia in the south and east, and Corinthia in the east and north. An account of the geography of the peninsula is given under these names. The area of Peloponnesus is computed to be 7779 English square miles, and it probably contained a population of upwards of a million in the flourishing period of Greek history.</p>
 <p>The Peloponnesus was originally inhabited by Pelasgians. Subsequently the Achaeans, who belonged to the Aeolic race, settled in the eastern and southern parts of the peninsula, in Argolis, Laconia, and Messenia; and the Ionians in the northern part, in Achaia; while the remains of the original inhabitants of the country, the Pelasgians, collected chiefly in the central part, in Arcadia. Eighty years after the Trojan War, according to mythical chronology, the Dorians, under the conduct of the Heraclidae, invaded and conquered Peloponnesus, and established Doric States in Argolis, Laconia, and Messenia, whence they extended their power over Corinth, Sicyon, and Megara. Part of the Achaean population remained in these provinces as tributary subjects to the Dorians, under the name of Perioeci; while others of the Achaeans passed over to the north of the Peloponnesus, expelled the Ionians, and settled in this part of the country, which was called after them Achaia. The Aetolians, who had invaded the Peloponnesus along with the Dorians, settled in Elis, and became intermingled with the original inhabitants. The peninsula remained under Doric influence during the most important period of Greek history, and opposed to the great Ionic city of Athens. After the conquest of Messenia by the Spartans it was under the supremacy of Sparta till the overthrow of the power of the latter by the Thebans at the battle of Leuctra, B.C. 371.

<div2 id="crosspelops" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pelops">Pelops</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πέλοψ</foreign>, “Black-face”). A grandson of Zeus and son of Tantalus and Dioné, the daughter of Atlas. Some writers call his mother Euryanassa or Clytia. He was married to Hippodamia, by whom he became the father of Atreus, Thyestes, Dias, Cynosurus, Corinthius, Hippalmus (Hippalcmus or Hippalcimus), Hippasus, Cleon, Argius, Alcathoüs, Aelius, Pittheus, Troezen, Nicippé, and Lysidicé, known collectively as the Pelopidae. By Axioché or the nymph Danaïs he is said to have been the father of Chrysippus. Pelops was king of Pisa in Elis, and from him the great southern peninsula of Greece was believed to have derived its name Peloponnesus. According to a tradition which became very general in later times, Pelops was a Phrygian, who was expelled by Ilus from Phrygia (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 8. 622" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>viii. 622</bibl>), and thereupon migrated with his great wealth to Pisa. Others describe him as a Paphlagonian, and call the Paphlagonians themselves <foreign lang="greek">Πελοπήϊοι</foreign>. Others again represent him as a native of Greece; and there can be little doubt that in the earliest traditions Pelops was described as a native of Greece and not as a foreign immigrant; in them, also, he is called the tamer of horses and the favourite of Poseidon. The legends about Pelops consist mainly of (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the story of his being cut to pieces and boiled; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) of his contest with Oenomaüs and Hippodamia; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of his relation to his sons, to which may be added the honours paid to his remains.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The first tells how Tantalus, the favourite of the gods, once invited them to a repast, and on that occasion killed his own son, and having boiled him set the flesh before them that they might eat it. But the immortal gods, knowing what it was, did not touch it; Demeter alone, being absorbed by grief for her lost daughter, consumed the shoulder of Pelops. Hereupon the gods ordered Hermes to put the limbs of Pelops into a caldron, and thereby restore him to life. When the process was over, Clotho took him out of the caldron, and as the shoulder consumed by Demeter was wanting, the goddess supplied its place by one made of ivory; his descendants (the Pelopidae), as a mark of their origin, were believed to have one shoulder as white as ivory.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) As an oracle had declared to Oenomaüs that he should be killed by his son-in-law, he refused giving his daughter Hippodamia in marriage to any one. But since many suitors appeared, Oenomaüs declared that he would bestow her hand upon the man who should conquer him in the chariot-race, but that he should kill all who were defeated by him. Among other suitors Pelops also presented himself; but when he saw the heads of his conquered predecessors stuck up above the door of Oenomaüs he was seized with fear, and endeavoured to gain the favour of Myrtilus, the charioteer of Oenomaüs, promising him half the kingdom if he would assist him in conquering his master. Myrtilus agreed, and drew out the linchpins of the chariot of Oenomaüs. In the race the chariot of Oenomaüs broke down, and he was thrown out and killed. Thus Hippodamia became the wife of Pelops. But as Pelops had now gained his object, he was unwilling to keep faith with Myrtilus; and accordingly, as they were driving along a cliff, he threw Myrtilus into the sea. As Myrtilus sank he cursed Pelops and 
<pb n="1196" /><cb />
 his whole race. Pelops returned with Hippodamia to Pisa in Elis, and soon also made himself master of Olympia, where he restored the Olympian Games with greater splendour than they had ever been celebrated before.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Chrysippus was the favourite of his father, and was, in consequence, envied by his brothers. The eldest two among them, Atreus and Thyestes, with the connivance of Hippodamia, accordingly murdered Chrysippus, and threw his body into a well. Pelops, who suspected his sons of the murder, expelled them from the country. Hippodamia, dreading the anger of her husband, fled to Midea in Argolis, whence her remains were afterwards conveyed by Pelops to Olympia.</p>
 <p>Pelops, after his death, was honoured at Olympia above all other heroes. His tomb, with an iron sarcophagus, existed on the banks of the Alpheus, not far from the temple of Artemis, near Pisa. The spot on which his sanctuary (<foreign lang="greek">Πελόπιον</foreign>) stood in the Altis was said to have been dedicated by Heracles, who also offered to him the first sacrifices. The magistrates of the Eleans likewise offered to him there an annual sacrifice, consisting of a black ram, with special ceremonies. The name of Pelops was so celebrated that it was constantly used by the poets in connection with his descendants and the cities they inhabited. Hence we find Atreus, the son of Pelops, called <title>Pelopeïus Atreus</title>, and Agamemnon, the grandson or great-grandson of Atreus, called <title>Pelopeïus Agamemnon.</title> In the same way Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, and Hermioné, the wife of Menelaüs, are each called by Ovid <title>Pelopeïa virgo.</title> Vergil ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 2. 193" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>ii. 193</bibl>) uses the phrase <title>Pelopea moenia</title> to signify the cities in Peloponnesus which Pelops and his descendants ruled over; and in like manner Mycenae is called by Ovid <title>Pelopeïades Mycenae.</title>

The hearth of the house was their altar, and on it were sculptured the figures of the two Penates beside that of the Lar.

Penelopé, however, exerted every resource which her ingenuity could suggest to protract the period of her decision: among others she declared that she would make choice of one of them as soon as she should have completed a web that she was weaving (intended as a funeral ornament for the aged Laertes); but she baffled their expectations by undoing at night what she had accomplished during <cb /> the day. This artifice has given rise to the proverb of “Penelopé's web,” or “to unweave the web of Penelopé” (<title>Penelopes telam retexere</title>), applied to whatever labour appears to be endless. For three years this artifice succeeded, but on the beginning of a fourth a disclosure was made by one of her female attendants; and the faithful and unhappy Penelopé, constrained at length by the renewed importunities of her persecutors, agreed, at their instigation, to bestow her hand on him who should shoot an arrow from the bow of Odysseus through a given number of axe-eyes placed in succession. An individual disguised as a beggar was the successful archer. This was no other than Odysseus, who had just returned to Ithaca. The hero then directed his shafts at the suitors, and slew them all. The character of Penelopé has been variously represented, some writers saying that she was unfaithful to Odysseus with all the suitors, and that from this intercourse was born Pan; but it is the more general version that she is to be considered as a model of conjugal and domestic virtue.

<head orig="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περδίκκας</foreign>). (1) The founder of the Macedonian monarchy according to Herodotus (viii. 137). He and his two brothers Gauanes and Aëropus were Argives who settled near Mount Bermius, whence they gradually conquered a part of the territory that was later known as Macedonia. Other writers, however, make Caranus the founder of the kingdom and Perdiccas only the fourth among the early kings. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaranus">Caranus</ref>.) Perdiccas was succeeded by his son Argaeus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmacedonia">Macedonia</ref>.</p>
 <p>(2) The son and successor of Alexander I. of Macedonia, reigning from B.C. 454 to 413. Shortly before the Peloponnesian War, Perdiccas 
<pb n="1199" /><cb /> was at war with the Athenians, who sent a force to support his brother Philip, and Derdas, a Macedonian chieftain, against the king, while the latter espoused the cause of Potidaea, which had shaken off the Athenian yoke, B.C. 432 ( <bibl n="Diod.  12. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xii. 34</bibl>). In the following year peace was concluded between Perdiccas and the Athenians, but it did not last long, and he was during the greater part of his reign on hostile terms with the Athenians. In B.C. 429 his dominions were invaded by Sitalces, king of the powerful Thracian tribe of the Odrysians, but the enemy was compelled, by want of provisions, to return home ( <bibl n="Diod.  12. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xii. 50</bibl>). It was in great part at his instigation that Brasidas in B.C. 424 set out on his celebrated expedition to Macedonia and Thrace. In the following year (B.C. 423), however, a misunderstanding arose between him and Brasidas; in consequence of which he abandoned the Spartan alliance, and concluded peace with Athens ( <bibl n="Thuc.  4. 82" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iv. 82</bibl>). Subsequently we find him at one time in alliance with the Spartans and at another time with the Athenians; and it is evident that he joined one or other of the belligerent parties according to the dictates of his own interest at the moment.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Perdiccas III.</hi>, king of Macedonia, B.C. 364-359, was the second son of Amyntas II., by his wife Eurydicé. On the assassination of his brother Alexander II., by Ptolemy of Alorus, B.C. 367, the crown of Macedonia devolved upon him by hereditary right, but Ptolemy virtually enjoyed the sovereign power as guardian of Perdiccas till B.C. 364, when the latter caused Ptolemy to be put to death, and took the government into his own hands ( <bibl n="Just.  7. 4" default="NO">Just.vii. 4</bibl>). Of the reign of Perdiccas we have very little information. We learn only that he was at one time engaged in hostilities with Athens on account of Amphipolis, and that he was distinguished for his patronage of men of letters. He fell in battle against the Illyrians in B.C. 359.</p>
 <p>(4) Son of Orontes, a Macedonian of the province of Orestis, was one of the most distinguished of the generals of Alexander the Great. He accompanied Alexander throughout his campaign in Asia; and the king, on his death-bed, is said to have taken the royal signet ring from his finger and given it to Perdiccas (Q. Curt. x. 5, 4). After the death of the king (B.C. 323), Perdiccas had the chief authority intrusted to him under the command of the new king Arrhidaeus, who was a mere puppet in his hands, and he still further strengthened his power by the assassination of his rival Meleager. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmeleager">Meleager</ref>.) The other generals of Alexander regarded him with fear and suspicion; and at length his ambitious schemes induced Antipater, Craterus, and Ptolemy to unite in a league and declare open war against Perdiccas. Thus assailed on all sides, Perdiccas determined to leave Eumenes in Asia Minor, to make head against their common enemies in that quarter, while he himself marched into Egypt against Ptolemy. He advanced without opposition as far as Pelusium, but found the banks of the Nile strongly fortified and guarded by Ptolemy, and was repulsed in repeated attempts to force the passage of the river; in the last of which, near Memphis, he lost great numbers of men. Thereupon his troops, who had long been discontented with Perdiccas, rose in mutiny and put him to death in his own tent ( <bibl n="Diod.  18. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xviii. 14</bibl>-36). <cb />

Perdix is sometimes confounded with Talos or Calos, and it is best to regard the various legends respecting Perdix, Talos, and Calos as referring to one and the same person—namely, according to the mythographers, a nephew of Daedalus. The inventions ascribed to him are the saw, the idea of which is said to have been suggested to him by the back-bone of a fish, or the teeth of a serpent; the chisel; the compasses; the potter's wheel. His skill excited the jealousy of Daedalus, who threw him headlong from the temple of Athené on the Acropolis, but the goddess caught him in his fall, and changed him into the bird which was named after him, <foreign lang="greek">πέρδιξ</foreign>, the partridge.

Under the Republic, duoviri were still appointed as presiding judges, till this gradually fell into disuse, and trials of the kind came in general to be dealt with by the popular court. In earlier times the penalty was death by hanging on a tree, by throwing from the Tarpeian Rock, or by beheading; later, banishment, and after the tribunes brought cases of perduellio before the Comitia Tributa, fines as well.

 <p>(2) A celebrated city of Asia Minor, the capital of the kingdom of Pergamum, and afterwards of the Roman province of Asia, was situated in the district of South Mysia called Teuthrania, on the north bank of the river Caïcus, about twenty miles from the sea. The kingdom of Pergamum was founded about B.C. 280 by Philetaerus, who had been intrusted by Lysimachus with the command of the city. The successive kings of Pergamus were: <ref type="cross" target="crossphiletaerus">Philetaerus</ref>, b.c. 280-263; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Eumĕnes I.</hi>, 263-241; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Attălus I.</hi>, 241-197; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Eumĕnes II.</hi>, 197- 159; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Attălus II. Philadelphus</hi>, 159-138; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Attălus III. Philomētor</hi>, 138-133. The kingdom reached its greatest extent after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by the Romans, in B.C. 190, when the Romans bestowed upon Eumenes II. the whole of <cb /> Mysia, Lydia, both Phrygias, Lycaonia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia. It was under the same king that the celebrated library was founded at Pergamus, which for a long time rivalled that of Alexandria, and the formation of which occasioned the invention of parchment, <title>charta Pergamena.</title> This library became the centre of a school of great importance in the history of ancient learning; amoung its leaders were such distinguished men as Crates of Mallos, who introduced philological studies into Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilologia">Philologia</ref>.) The Pergamene Library was afterwards presented by Antony to Cleopatra and united with the Alexandrian. On the death of Attalus III., in B.C. 133, the kingdom, by a bequest in his will, passed to the Romans. The city was an early seat of Christianity, and is one of the Seven Churches of Asia to which the Apocalyptic epistles are addressed. Among the celebrated natives of the city were the rhetorician Apollodorus and the physician Galen. The place is now called Bergama; and here were excavated in 1875-86, by Humann, Bohn, Conze, and others for the German government, many remains of magnificent buildings, such as temples, porticoes, theatres, baths, etc.

<head orig="Periander">Periander</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περίανδρος</foreign>). (1) Son of Cypselus, whom he succeeded as tyrant of Corinth in B.C. 625, and reigned forty years, to B.C. 585. His rule was mild and beneficent at first, but afterwards became oppressive. According to the common story, this change was owing to the advice of Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus, whom Periander had consulted on the best mode of maintaining his power, and who is said to have taken the messenger through a cornfield, cutting off as he went the tallest ears, and then to have dismissed him without committing himself to a verbal answer. The action, however, was rightly interpreted by Periander, who proceeded to rid himself of the most powerful nobles in the State. He made his power respected abroad as well as at home; and besides his conquest of Epidaurus, mentioned below, he kept Corcyra in subjection. He was, like many of the other Greek tyrants, a patron of literature and philosophy, and Arion and Anacharsis were in favor at his court. He was very commonly reckoned among the Seven Sages, though by some he was excluded from their number, and Myson of Chenae in Laconia was substituted in his place.</p>
 <p>The private life of Periander was marked by misfortune and cruelty. He married Melissa , daughter of Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus. She bore him two sons, Cypselus and Lycophron, and was passionately beloved by him; but he is said to have killed her by a blow during her pregnancy, having been roused to a fit of anger by a false accusation brought against her. His wife's death embittered the remainder of his days, partly through the remorse which he felt for the deed, partly through 
<pb n="1201" /><cb />
 the alienation of his younger son Lycophron, inexorably exasperated by his mother's fate. The young man's anger had been chiefly excited by Procles, and Periander, in revenge, attacked Epidaurus, and, having reduced it, took his father-inlaw prisoner. Periander sent Lycophron to Corcyra; but when he was himself advanced in years, he summoned Lycophron back to Corinth to succeed to the tyranny, seeing that Cypselus, his elder son, was unfit to hold it, from deficiency of understanding. Lycophron refused to return to Corinth as long as his father was there; thereupon Periander offered to withdraw to Corcyra if Lycophron would come home and take the government. To this he assented; but the Corcyraeans, not wishing to have Periander among them, put Lycophron to death. Periander shortly afterwards died of despondency, at the age of eighty, and after a reign of forty years, according to Diogenes Laertius. He was succeeded by a relative, Psammetichus, son of Gordias. See Herod. iii. 48-53; v. 92; Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5. 12." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>v. 12.</bibl></p>
 <p>(2) Tyrant of Ambracia, and contemporary with his more famous namesake of Corinth, to whom he was also related, being the son of Gorgus, who was son or brother to Cypselus. Periander was deposed by the people about B.C. 585 ( <title>V. H.</title> xii. 35).

<div2 id="crosspericles" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Perĭcles">Pericles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περικλῆς</foreign>). (1) The greatest of Athenian statesmen. He was the son of Xanthippus and Agaristé, both of whom belonged to the noblest families of Athens. The fortune of his parents procured for him a careful education, which his extraordinary abilities and diligence turned to the best account. He received instruction from Damon , Zeno of Elea, and Anaxagoras. With Anaxagoras he lived on terms of the most intimate friendship till the philosopher was compelled to retire from Athens. From this great and original thinker Pericles was believed to have derived not only the cast of his mind, but the character of his eloquence, which, in the elevation of its sentiments and the purity and loftiness of its style, was the fitting expression of the force and dignity of his character and the grandeur of his conceptions. Of the oratory of Pericles no specimens remain to us, but it is described by ancient writers as characterized by singular force and energy. He was described as thundering and lightening when he spoke, and as carrying the weapons of Zeus upon his tongue ( <bibl n="Quint.  10. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.x. 1</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  82" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 82</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In B.C. 469 Pericles began to take part in public affairs, forty years before his death, and was soon regarded as the head of the more democratic part in the State in opposition to Cimon. He gained the favour of the people by the laws which he succeeded in passing for their benefit. Thus it was enacted through his means that the citizens should receive from the public treasury the price of their admittance to the theatre, amounting to two oboli apiece; that those who served in the courts of the Heliaea should be paid for their attendance; and that those citizens who served as soldiers should likewise be paid. It was at his instigation that his friend Ephialtes proposed, in 461, the measure by which the Areopagus was deprived of those functions which rendered it formidable as an antagonist to the popular party. This success was followed by the ostracism of Cimon, who was charged with Laconism, and Pericles was thus placed at the head of public affairs at Athens. Pericles was distinguished as a general as well as a statesman, and frequently commanded the Athenian armies in their wars with the neighbouring States. In 454 he commanded the Athenians in their campaigns against the Sicyonians and Acarnanians; in 448 he led the army which assisted the Phocians in the Sacred War; and in 445 he rendered the most signal service to the State by recovering the island of Euboea, which had revolted from Athens. Cimon had been previously recalled from exile without any opposition from Pericles, but had died in 449. On his death the aristocratic party was headed by Thucydides, the son of Melesias; but on the ostracism of the latter in 444 the organized opposition of the aristocratic party was broken up, and Pericles was left without a rival. Throughout the remainder of his political course 
<pb n="1202" /><cb />
 no one appeared to contest his supremacy; but the boundless influence which he possessed was never perverted by him to sinister or unworthy purposes. So far from being a mere selfish demagogue, he neither indulged nor courted the multi<figure id="fig.01202">
<head orig="Pericles. (Vatican.)">Pericles. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> tude. The next important event in which Pericles was engaged was the war against Samos, which had revolted from Athens, and which he subdued after an arduous campaign, 440. The poet Sophocles was one of the generals who fought with Pericles against Samos ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 115" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 115</bibl>-117).</p>
 <p>For the next ten years, till the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians were not engaged in any considerable military operations. During this period Pericles devoted especial attention to the Athenian navy, as her supremacy rested on her maritime superiority, and he adopted various judicious means for consolidating and strengthening her empire over the islands of the Aegaean. The funds derived from the tribute of the allies and from other sources were, to a large extent, devoted by him to the erection of those magnificent temples and public buildings which rendered Athens the wonder and admiration of Greece. Under his administration the Propylaea and the Parthenon and the Odeum were erected as well as numerous other temples and public buildings. With the stimulus afforded by these works architecture and sculpture reached their highest perfection, and some of the greatest artists of antiquity were employed in erecting or adorning the buildings. The chief direction and oversight of the public edifices was intrusted to Phidias. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossphidias">Phidias</ref>.) These works, calling into activity almost every branch of industry and commerce at Athens, diffused universal prosperity while they proceeded, and thus contributed in this, as well as in other ways, to maintain the popularity and influence of Pericles. But he still had many enemies, who were not slow to impute to him base and unworthy motives. From the comic poets Pericles had to sustain numerous attacks. They exaggerated his power, spoke of his party as Pisistratids, and called upon him to swear that he was not about to assume the tyranny. His high character and strict probity, however, rendered all these attacks harmless. But as his enemies were unable to ruin his reputation by these means, they attacked him through his friends. His friends Phidias and Anaxagoras, and his mistress <ref type="cross" target="crossaspasia">Aspasia</ref> (q.v.), were all accused before the people. Phidias was condemned and cast into prison; Anaxagoras was also sentenced to pay a fine and leave Athens (see <ref type="cross" target="crossanaxagoras">Anaxagoras</ref>); and Aspasia was only acquitted through the entreaties and tears of Pericles ( <bibl n="Plut. Per. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Per.</title>24</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The Peloponnesian War has been falsely ascribed to the ambitious schemes of Pericles. It is true that he counselled the Athenians not to yield to the demands of the Lacedaemonians, and he pointed out the immense advantages which the Athenians possessed in carrying on the war; but he did <cb /> this because he saw that war was inevitable; and that as long as Athens retained the great power which she then possessed, Sparta would never rest contented. On the outbreak of the war in 431 a Peloponnesian army under Archidamus invaded Attica; and upon his advice the Athenians conveyed their movable property into the city and their cattle and beasts of burden to Euboea, and allowed the Peloponnesians to desolate Attica without opposition. Next year (430), when the Peloponnesians again invaded Attica, Pericles pursued the same policy as before. In this summer a plague made its appearance in Athens. The Athenians, being exposed to the devastation of the war and the plague at the same time, began to turn their thoughts to peace, and looked upon Pericles as the author of all their distresses, inasmuch as he had persuaded them to go to war. Pericles attempted to calm the public ferment; but such was the irritation against him that he was sentenced to pay a fine ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 64" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 64</bibl>). The ill-feeling of the people having found this vent, Pericles soon resumed his accustomed sway, and was again elected one of the generals for the ensuing year (429). Meantime Pericles had suffered in common with his fellow-citizens. The plague carried off most of his near connections. His son Xanthippus, a profligate and undutiful youth, his sister, and most of his intimate friends died of it. Still he maintained unmoved his calm bearing and philosophic composure. At last his only surviving legitimate son, Paralus, a youth of greater promise than his brother, fell a victim. The firmness of Pericles then at last gave way; as he placed the funeral garland on the head of the lifeless youth, he burst into tears and sobbed aloud. He had one son remaining, his child by Aspasia; and he was allowed to enroll this son in his own tribe and give him his own name. In the autumn of 429 Pericles himself died of a lingering sickness. He survived the commencement of the war two years and six months. The name of the wife of Pericles is not mentioned. She had been the wife of Hipponicus, by whom she was the mother of Callias. She bore two sons to Pericles, Xanthippus and Paralus. She lived unhappily with Pericles, and a divorce took place by mutual consent, when Pericles connected himself with Aspasia. Of his strict probity he left the decisive proof in the fact that at his death he was found not to have added a single drachma to his hereditary property. His greatest fault as a statesman was his inability to see that personal government in the long run is injurious to a nation; for it impairs the capacity of the people for self-government, and on the death of the chief leaves them helpless and inexperienced. On his death-bed his friends were commenting on his victories and triumphs, when he interrupted them with the remark, “That which you have left unnoticed is that of which I am the proudest; no Athenian ever wore mourning through any act of mine.” His life is sketched for us by Thucydides and Plutarch. See also the sketch by E. Abbott <bibl default="NO">(London, 1891)</bibl>; and for a comprehensive account of his times, Lloyd, <bibl default="NO"><title>The Age of Perikles</title> (London, 1875)</bibl>; Filleul, <bibl default="NO"><title>Histoire du Siècle de Periclès</title> (Paris, 1873)</bibl>; also Frey, <bibl default="NO"><title>Leben des Perikles</title> (Bern, 1889)</bibl>.</p>

<head orig="Perioeci">Perioeci</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">περίοικοι</foreign>, “those dwelling about,” from <foreign lang="greek">περιοικέω</foreign>). A name used by Greek writers of a subject population dwelling in the vicinity of some particular dominant city, or in the rural provinces under its control, personally free but devoid of political rights. The name is more properly applied to a class found in Laconia who were probably in their origin partly representatives of the original Achaian stock conquered by the Dorian invaders and partly a mixed race resulting from the marriage of the Dorians with the Achaians. (See E. Curtius, <title>History of Greece</title>, Eng. trans. ii. ch. i.) They possessed lands, and are stated to have been settled in a hundred towns (Strabo, viii. p. 557), among which were Gythium on the coast, Thyrca, and Amyelae. Clinton (<title>Fasti Hellenici</title>, App. ch. xxii.) estimates roughly their number at the time of the Persian Wars as between 60,000 and 70,000 souls.</p>
 <p>The perioeci were engaged partly in farming, partly in manufacturing and in trade. They paid taxes to the State, and were bound to perform military service either as hoplites or as light-armed troops. The perioecic inhabitants of Sciritis formed a special body of light infantry. After the Peloponnesian War the perioeci constituted the bulk of the Spartan army, and they were eligible to the inferior commands. Having no civil rights, they were completely subject to the Spartans proper, and in case of insubordination they could be put to death by the ephors without trial. On rare occasions a perioecus is found in a high office, as in the case mentioned by Thucydides (viii. 22), where one of them was admiral of an allied Chian fleet; but they seem never to have been put over Spartans. The name <foreign lang="greek">περίοικοι</foreign> is also used of other subject populations as a convenient term (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 159" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 159</bibl>), but these were not perioeci in the Laconian sense of the word.</p>

 and the Daughter” (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Μητὴρ καὶ ἡ Κόρη</foreign>). Being the infernal goddess of death, she is also called a daughter of Zeus and Styx. In Arcadia she was worshipped under the name of Despoena, and was called a daughter of Poseidon Hippius and Demeter, said to have been brought up by the Titan Anytus. Homer describes her as the wife of Hades, and the formidable, venerable, and majestic queen of the Shades, who rules over the souls of the dead, along with her husband. Hence she is called by later Roman writers Iuno Inferna, Averna, and Stygia; and the Erinyes are said to have been her daughters by Pluto. Groves sacred to her are placed by Homer in the western extremity of the earth, on the borders of the lower world, which is itself called the house of Persephoné. The story of her being carried off by Hades or Pluto against her will is not mentioned by Homer, who simply describes her as the wife and queen of Hades. Her abduction is first mentioned by Hesiod. The account of it, which is the most celebrated part of her story, and the wanderings of her mother in search of her, and the worship of <figure id="fig.01205">

In the mystical theories of the Orphics, Persephoné is described as the all-pervading goddess of nature, who both produces and destroys everything; and she is therefore mentioned along, or identified with, other mystic divinities, such as Isis, Rhea, Gê, Hestia, Pandora, Artemis, and Hecaté. This mystic Persephoné is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus, Iacchus, Zagreus, or Sabazius.</p>
 <p>Persephoné frequently appears in works of art. She is represented either with the grave and severe character of an infernal Heré or as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box, in the act of being carried off by Pluto. Her symbols are a torch or torches, a cornucopia, ears of corn, pomegranates, or a cock as heralding the dawn (i. e. a new life).

<head orig="Persepŏlis">Persepolis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περσέπολις, Περσαίπολις</foreign>; in the Middle Ages, Istakhar; now Takhti-Jemshid, i. e. “Throne of Jemshid,” or Chil-Minar, i. e. “Forty Pillars”). The Greek name, probably translated from the Persian name which is not recorded, of <cb /> the great city which succeeded Pasargada as the capital of Persis and of the Persian Empire. From the circumstance, however, of the conquest of the Babylonian Empire taking place about the time when Persepolis attained this dignity, it appears to have been seldom used as the royal residence. Neither Herodotus, Xenophon, Ctesias, nor the sacred writers during the Persian period, mention it at all; though they often speak of Babylon, Susa, and Ecbatana as the capitals of the Empire. It is only from the Greek writers after the Macedonian conquest that we learn its rank in the Empire, which appears to have consisted chiefly in its being one of the two burial places of the Persian kings (the other being Pasargada), and also a royal treasury; for Alexander found in the palace immense riches, which were said to have accumulated from the time of Cyrus. Its foundation is sometimes ascribed to Cyrus the Great, but more generally to his son Cambyses. It was greatly enlarged and adorned by Darius I. and Xerxes, and preserved its splendour till after the Macedonian conquest, when it was burned; Alexander, as the story goes, setting fire to the palace with his own hand at the end of a revel by the instigation of the courtesan Thaïs in B.C. 331. It was not, however, so entirely destroyed as some historians represent. It appears frequently in subsequent history, both ancient and mediaeval. It is now deserted, but its ruins are considerable, though too dilapidated to give any good notion of Persian architecture, and they are rich in cuneiform inscriptions. In the days of its splendour a great plaza or species of platform was crowned with palaces, halls, and altars. Here were stored the treasures which Alexander rifled; and here was kept the copy of the Avesta (see <ref type="cross" target="crosszoroaster">Zoroaster</ref>), written on 12,000 oxhides in letters of gold.</p>
 <p>Among the ruins still existing three groups are distinguished by archaeologists: first, the Forty Pillars proper, with the so-called “Mountain of Tombs” or “Throne of Jamshid,” after a fabulous king who is said to have founded the city; second, the Naksh-in-Rustam, a collection of tombs; and third, a building now called “the Haram of Jamshid.” The first group is the most important, being the terrace already mentioned, built of cyclopean masonry, and extending 1500 feet in one 
<pb n="1206" /><cb />
 direction and 800 in another. It was once surrounded by triple walls of a height varying from about 48 to 100 feet. There are still to be distinguished on the central platform the so-called “Great Hall of Xerxes,” the Palace of Xerxes, and the Palace of Darius. The stone used for these structures is dark grayish marble cut into enormous square blocks, and highly polished. The ascent to this platform is by two double flights of steps nearly 22 feet in width and only 3 1/2 inches high, so that they have been ascended in modern times on horseback. The portals still exhibit huge figures of animals, 15 feet high, and not unlike the Assyrian bulls of Nineveh. The cuneiform inscriptions are ascribed to Xerxes.</p>
 <p>Persepolis was situated in the heart of Persis, in the part called Hollow Persis (<foreign lang="greek">κοίλη Περσίς</foreign>), not far from the border of the Carmanian Desert, in a beautiful and healthy valley, through which runs the river Araxes. After Alexander's time the place was of secondary importance. It was plundered by Antiochus in B.C. 164, and later was the residence of a Persian viceroy.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περσεύς</foreign>). Son of Zeus and Danaë, the daughter of Acrisius. A sketch of his fabulous history has already been given under a previous article (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdanae">Danaë</ref>); and it remains here but to relate the particulars of his enterprise against the Gorgons. When Perseus had made his rash promise to Polydectes, by which he bound himself to bring the latter the Gorgon 's head, he retired full of grief to the extremity of the island of Scyros, where Hermes came to him, promising that he and Athené would be his guides. Hermes brought him first to the Graiae (see <ref type="cross" target="crossphorcydes">Phorcydes</ref>), whose eye and tooth he stole and would not restore until they had furnished him with directions to the abode of the nymphs who were possessed of the winged shoes, the magic wallet, and the helmet of Pluto which made the wearer invisible. Having obtained from the Graiae the requisite information, he came to the nymphs, who gave him their precious possessions: he then flung the wallet over his shoulder, placed the helmet on his head, and fitted the shoes to his feet. Thus equipped, and <cb /> <figure id="fig.01206">
<head orig="Perseus and Andromeda. (Marble relief in the Naples Museum.)">Perseus and Andromeda. (Marble relief in the Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> grasping the short curved sword (<foreign lang="greek">ἅρπη</foreign>) which Hermes gave him, he mounted into the air, accompanied by the gods, and flew to the ocean, where he found the three Gorgons asleep. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgorgo">Gorgones</ref>.) Fearing to gaze on their faces, which changed the beholder to stone, he looked on the head of Medusa as it was reflected on his shield, and, Athené guiding his hand, he severed it from her body. The blood gushed forth, and with it the winged steed Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon, for Medusa was at that time pregnant by Poseidon. Perseus took up the head, put it into his wallet, and set out on his return. The two sisters awoke, and pursued the fugitive; but, protected by the helmet of Pluto, he eluded their vision, and they were obliged to give over the bootless chase ( <title>Scut.</title> 220-230; Pausan. v. 18, 1). Perseus pursued his aërial route, and after having, in the course of his journey, punished the inhospitality of <ref type="cross" target="crossatlas">Atlas</ref> (q.v.) by changing him into a rocky mountain (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 4. 626" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>iv. 626</bibl> foll.), he came to the country of the Ethiopians. Here he liberated Andromeda (see <ref type="cross" target="crossandromeda">Andromeda</ref>), whom he married. He is also said to have come to the Hyperboreans, by whom he was hospitably received. On his return to Seriphos, he found his mother with Dictys in a temple, whither they had fled from the violence of Polydectes. Perseus then went to the palace of Polydectes, and metamorphosed him and all his guests, and, some say, the whole island, into stone ( <title>Pyth.</title> xii. 10). He then presented the kingdom to Dictys. He gave the winged sandals and the helmet to Hermes, who restored them to the nymphs and to Pluto, and the head of Gorgon to Athené, who placed it in the middle of her shield or breast-plate. Perseus then went to Argos, accompanied by 
<pb n="1207" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Danaë and Andromeda. Acrisius, remembering the oracle, escaped to Larissa, in the country of the Pelasgians; but Perseus followed him, in order to persuade him to return. Some writers state that Perseus, on his return to Argos, found Proetus, who had expelled his brother Acrisius, in possession of the kingdom; and that Perseus slew Proetus, and was afterwards killed by Megapenthes, the son of Proetus. The more common tradition, however, relates that when Teutamidas, king of Larissa, celebrated games in honour of his guest Acrisius, Perseus, who took part in them, accidentally hit the foot of Acrisius with the discus, and thus killed him. Acrisius was buried outside the city of Larissa, and Perseus, leaving the kingdom of Argos to Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, received from him in exchange the government of Tiryns. According to others, Perseus remained in Argos, and successfully opposed the introduction of the Bacchic orgies. Perseus is said to have founded the towns of Midea and Mycenae. By Andromeda he became the father of Perses, Aïcaeus, Sthenelus, Heleus, Mestor, Electryon, Gorgophoné, and Autochthé. Perseus was worshipped as a hero in several places in Greece and even in Egypt ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 91" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 91</bibl>).

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Perses</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Περσεύς</foreign>). The last king of Macedonia, the eldest son of Philip V. He reigned eleven years, from B.C. 178 to 168. Before his accession he persuaded his father to put to death his younger brother Demetrius, whom he suspected that the Roman Senate intended to set up as a competitor for the throne on the death of Philip. Immediately after his accession he began to make preparations for war with the Romans, which he knew to be inevitable, though seven years elapsed before actual hostilities commenced. The war broke out in B.C. 171. The first year of the war was marked by no striking action. The consul P. Licinius Crassus first suffered a defeat in Thessaly in an engagement between the cavalry of the two armies, but subsequently gained a slight advantage over the king's troops. The second year of the war (B.C. 170), in which the consul A. Hostilius Mancinus commanded, also passed over without any important battle, but was, on the whole, favourable to Perseus. The third year (B.C. 169), in which the consul Q. Marcius Philippus commanded, again produced no important results. The length to which the war had been unexpectedly protracted, and the ill success of the Roman arms, had by this time excited a general feeling in favour of the Macedonian monarch; but the ill-timed avarice of Perseus, who refused to advance the sum of money which Eumenes, king of Pergamus, demanded, deprived him of this valuable ally; and the same unseasonable niggardliness likewise deprived him of the services of <figure id="fig.01207">
<head orig="Coin of Perseus, King of Macedonia.">Coin of Perseus, King of Macedonia.</head>
</figure> <cb /> twenty thousand Gallic mercenaries, who had actually advanced into Macedonia to his support, but retired on failing to obtain their stipulated pay. He was left to carry on the contest against Rome single-handed.</p>
 <p>The fourth year of the war (B.C. 168) was also the last. The new consul, L. Aemilius Paulus, defeated Perseus with great loss in a decisive battle fought near Pydna, on June 22, B.C. 168. Perseus took refuge in the island of Samothrace, where he shortly afterwards surrendered with his children to the praetor Cn. Octavius. When brought before Aemilius he is said to have degraded himself by the most abject supplications; but he was treated with kindness by the Roman general. The following year he was carried to Italy, where he was compelled to adorn the splendid triumph of his conqueror (November 30, B.C. 167), and afterwards cast into a dungeon, from whence, however, the intercession of Aemilius procured his release, and he was permitted to end his days in an honourable captivity at Alba. He survived his removal thither a few years, and died, according to some accounts, by voluntary starvation, while others, fortunately with less probability, represent him as falling a victim to the cruelty of his guards, who deprived him of sleep. Perseus had been twice married; the name of his first wife, whom he is said to have killed with his own hand in a fit of passion, is not recorded; his second, Laodicé, was the daughter of Seleucus IV. Philopator. He left two children —a son, Alexander, and a daughter, both apparently by his second marriage, as they were mere children when carried to Rome. Besides these, he had adopted his younger brother Philip, who appears to have been regarded by him as the heir to his throne, and who became the partner of his captivity. See Livy, bks. xl.-xliv.; and Polyb. bks. xxiv., xxvi., xxvii., xxix.

<head orig="Persia">Persia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Περσική</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">γῆ, Περσίς</foreign>; Lat. <ref type="cross" target="crosspersis">Persis</ref>, more rarely <ref type="cross" target="crosspersia">Persia;</ref> old <title>Pārsa</title>). The original home of the ancient Persians, and later the chief province of the great Persian Empire, is the small territory in the southwestern corner of the Iranian tableland. In this limited and original sense, Persia corresponds exactly to the present Province of Fārs or Fārsistān with the capital Shīrāz. On the north it was bounded by Media, on the east by Karmania, on the southwest by the Persian Gulf, and on the northwest by the province of Susiana. The latter had from the time of Cyrus been closely united with Persia (Strabo, p. 727). Persis was separated from Media by the Parachoathras Mountains, the most southerly spur of the Taurus. Persia is a highland rising in terraces to a height of 5000 metres, intersected by many clefts, with approaches on most sides only by difficult rocky passes. In consequence of its isolated position, the oriental peoples, before the time of Alexander, had only a scanty knowledge of the land. The flat coast line was intolerably hot, sandy, and unfruitful; but in the interior the climate was everywhere favorable, temperate, and for the latitude almost raw, on account of the elevated position; the valleys and plains productive and well watered, with many clear rivers and lakes, where all kinds of waterfowl made their homes, covered with fertile meadows and gardens, and pasturage for horses and cattle, and, in parts, with forests and game. Wine and all fruits except olive oil were produced. 
<pb n="1208" /><cb /> The northern portion of Persia, on the other hand, is cold and snow is frequent. As a whole, Persia was intended by nature more for a grazing than for an agricultural country. The largest inland river is the Araxes (now Bundemir), which empties into a salt lake, with its tributary the Medos (now Pulvar). In the fruitful plain of the Medos in the centre of the country, sixty kilometres northeast of the present Shīrāz, over 1000 metres high, in a mild and healthful climate, lay the capital Persepolis (later Istakhr). Next to Susa, Persepolis was the largest and most beautiful city in the land. Here stood the costly and strong royal citadel (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ βασίλεια</foreign>), the extensive ruins of whose walls, terraces, halls, and state apartments are still extant. Twelve kilometres down the river was the rock-hewn grave city of the Achaemenids (now Naksh-i-Rustem). Persepolis remained the nominal capital of the kingdom even after the kings had moved their residence to Susa and in mid-summer to Ecbatana. The original seat of the dynasty lay two days' journey northeast of Persepolis, in the so-called lower Persis, on the little river Cyrus, the present Murghāb. There stood the ancient royal city of Pasargadae with the palace and the still preserved tomb of Cyrus (Strabo, p. 727 ff.; Arrian, <title>Indica</title>, 40; <bibl n="Ptol.  6. 7" default="NO">Ptol.vi. 7</bibl><bibl n="Ptol.  8" default="NO">Ptol., 8</bibl>). In a wider sense the name Persia embraces the whole Persian nation of Iranian race, which should rather be called Irān. The broad highland of Irān, from the Tigris to the Indus, from the Indian Ocean to the Oxus and the Caspian Sea, is divided into halves by the great salt desert in its midst —western Irān with the States of Media and Persia, and northeastern Irān with Sogdiana, Chorasmia, Bactria, Areia, and Arachosia. These divisions are united only in the north by a narrow inhabitated strip, Hyrcania. The old geographers confined the term <foreign lang="greek">Ἀριανή</foreign> to Eastern Irān. The feeling of national unity existed in all the tribes; their common name was once that of Aryan. Darius emphasizes first of all the fact that he is a Persian, the son of a Persian, and secondarily that he is an Aryan, of Aryan race. The Medes, too, according to Herodotus (vii. 62), anciently called themselves Aryans. The national unity of all Irān, a national dream even in the old heroic legends, was fully realized only once, under the Achaemenids. The empire of the Sassanids did not succeed in recovering the whole east of Irān. The present Persia fully includes only western Irān, and extends eastward not far beyond the eastern edge of the salt desert. The greater part of the ancient eastern Irān is occupied by Afghans and Turcomans.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Ethnology</hi>.—The inhabitants of Persis were originally a genuine mountain race of shepherds. Herodotus, Xenophon, and others describe the ancient Persians (old Pārsa, formerly, according to <bibl n="Hdt.  vii" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  61" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 61</bibl>, called Atrei) as an energetic, brave, contented race, of inordinate self-esteem, accustomed to hardships but not lacking in finer traits, fond of rude pleasures, of strict discipline, with a certain sense of justice, and of sound morals. The Persian sculptures show a noble profile, with long, straight nose, and carefully arranged beard. They ate only once a day, but then heartily, and drank wine freely. The life of men of station was consumed in hunting, travelling, archery, and war. The Persians served in the army from the twentieth to the fiftieth year. The soldiers wore the <cb /> characteristic pointed felt hat (<foreign lang="greek">τιάρα</foreign>), a coloured coat and breeches, and carried a light shield, a short spear, a long bow with thirty arrows, and the short dagger-sword (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκινάκης</foreign>). Commerce was unknown among them, as were also rapine and thieving; lying, developed in the East to a virtue, they abhorred, at least in theory. Next to lying, incurring debt was considered the greatest disgrace. Polygamy and paederasty were customary. Large families of children were esteemed honourable and the king offered yearly prizes for them. Education was undertaken by the State; the sons of nobles were brought up as pages at the court, where they were prepared for the high State offices. All kinds of bodily exercise and truthfulness were required of the youth, and they were early accustomed to hardship and watchfulness. They studied the sciences, traditions, natural history, and arboriculture ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 133" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 133</bibl> ff.;  <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Anab.</title>i. 9</bibl>; <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Cyrop.</title>i. 2</bibl>; viii. 8). Even Herodotus blames their fatal eagerness to imitate foreign customs. Thus in place of their ancient simple leather garments, they took from the more civilized Medes a more highly adorned dress (purple caftan, necklaces, and bracelets, <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cyrop.</title>i. 3</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cyrop., 2</bibl>), false hair, and a blasé air of fashion, and wherever they heard of a new form of amusement they introduced it. With their growing dominion and under the influence of foreign customs the Persians rapidly deteriorated. Luxury, debauchery, and effeminacy destroyed their former discipline and bodily excellence. Cruelty and barbarity on the part of those in authority, extortion, crime, and injustice became the order of the day (Agathias, ii. 30;  <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 8. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Cyrop.</title>viii. 8</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. Cyrop., 6</bibl>). The traditional origin of the Persian satraps is quite incredible.</p>
 <p>The Persian nation was divided into various tribes, each possessing its own special portion of farming and pasture land. Of the ruling nobility, to which all other classes were subject, there were according to Herodotus three orders: the Pasargadae, Maraphii, and Maspii. Of these the Pasargadae were the highest; from them sprang the dynasty of the Achaemenids, who raised themselves from petty tribal chiefs and princes to national sovereigns. The king was permitted to select his wives only from the six highest families of the land, and the six “First of the Persians” had free access to the king.</p>
 <p>The Iranian languages belong to the Indogermanic stock. In spite of strong dialectic differences, a specific Iranian type is unmistakably noticeable in all. Their common characteristic marks are the change of s to h, the preference for fricatives, and the great development of sibilants. Old- Pers. hanti (“they are”)=Skt. santi, Lat. sunt; hindu (Indus)=Skt. Sindhu; fra=Skt. pra, <foreign lang="greek">πρό</foreign>; thri (three)=mod. Pers. si=Skt. tri.</p>
 <p>Old Persian stands on a very primitive stage, still very close to Sanskrit. The sentence from an inscription “Aüramazdā hya imām bumim adā hya avam asmānam adā hya martīyam adā” (“Ormuzd, who created this earth, who created that heaven, who created man”), would read in Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">asuro medhasvi ya imAm bhUmim adhAd yo 'mum as/mAnam adhAd yo martyam adhAt.</foreign> Characteristic is the change of the Iranian z to d; adam (I)=Avestan azem; and f for Eastern Iranian hv: Vindafarnā (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰνταφέρνης</foreign>)=Avestan Vindat-hvarenāo. The final syllable is greatly maimed: abara= Skt. abharat (“he bore”). 
<pb n="1209" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The ancient Persians left no real literature. Remains of a lost heroic epic of Eastern Irān are to be found in the Avestā. But we have a fairly accurate knowledge of the language of the old Persians from the rock-inscriptions in which Darius I. and his successors perpetuated their deeds in plain, almost clumsy style. The most extensive of these inscriptions are those of Darius on the smoothed rock-face of Mount Behistān in Media, 426 lines, with a twofold translation. These Persian inscriptions are written in the simplest form of cuneiform, and, so far as they are not destroyed by the action of the weather or wantonly, they have been almost completely deciphered. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscuneiform">Cuneiform</ref>.) Of the language of the Medes we know only a few words through the Greeks; it probably resembled Old Persian. The dog was called by the Medes spakō ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 110" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 110</bibl>), in the Avestā spā. The home of the very primitive language of the Avestā cannot be determined.</p>
 <p>From the Old Persian was developed the Middle Persian or Pahlavī, the literary and official language under the Sassanids. A peculiar cryptographic system (with Semitic ideograms), and a very defective and ambiguous alphabet, make this language unnecessarily difficult. While the Old Persian is still rich in grammatical forms, the Pahlavī shows great poverty. Still further poverty is shown in the Modern Persian (from the tenth century A.D. the national language of modern Persia), the last stage of development in the local speech of the Persians. The purest Modern Persian is still spoken around Shīrāz.</p>
 <p>Among the arts architecture and sculpture hold the first place. Monumental structures are confined exclusively to the numerous royal palaces, and of their former magnitude the ruins of Susa and the far more imposing remains of Persepolis are silent witnesses. Their luxury and extravagance were a source of amazement to the Greeks. Founded by Darius, most of them were enlarged and finished by his successors. According to the detailed description of Polybius (x. 27), the palace in Ecbatana at the time of the Achaemenids (whether during the period of the Medes is questionable) was covered with silver tiles, and a great part of the interior was coated with gold and silver plates. And so it may have been in Persepolis. But while the Median palace was a wooden structure, the material in Persepolis is a durable stone. The treatment of the stone shows a high degree of workmanship; walls and columns are ornamented with reliefs and inscriptions. The architectural style was drawn from the Babylonian and Assyrian, but was not a slavish imitation. The palace of Persepolis lay on a terrace of ten metres in height, with the rear towards a mountain. It was protected by an ingenious threefold wall and brazen doors. The interior contained the dwelling and reception rooms of the king and his highest officials, as well as the treasure-chambers. (Cf. the description of <bibl n="Diod.  17. 71." default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvii. 71.</bibl>) The slender columns are twenty metres high and end in lofty, delicate capitals. The whole produced an effect of towering and imposing elegance and gigantic dimensions.</p>
 <p>The numerous sculptures excavated do not depict single episodes in the life of the king, but form a common symbolic picture-language, glorifying the splendour of the kingdom and its far-reaching might. The composition is in general stiff and <cb /> <figure id="fig.01209">
<head orig="Specimen of Persian Sculpture from Persepolis.">Specimen of Persian Sculpture from Persepolis.</head>
</figure> monotonous, but is carefully elaborated in details; the faces expressionless, but the forms lifelike and natural, the dress, weapons, etc., reproduced with great fidelity.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Religion</hi>.—The Perso-Iranian national religion has from the oldest times been the Zoroastrian, with its belief in a good and an evil spirit (Ormuzd, ahurō mazdāo; Ahriman, anro mainyush), worship of moral and natural powers (Asha, “law”; Rashnu, “justice”; Mithra, “sun”), purity of body and soul, after death a strict balancing of good and evil deeds, with the rewards of paradise or the punishments of hell, a last judgment, resurrection of the dead, marriage of relatives, etc. In all probability the teachings of <ref type="cross" target="crosszoroaster">Zoroaster</ref> (q.v.) originated in the East and spread westward into Media. The external and internal history of the Zoroastrian doctrine until it became a fully developed national church is still dark. In Media the Magi, one of the Median orders, became the privileged priestly class. The Magi, doubtless under the Median supremacy, carried the religious movement to Persis, and there also remained in exclusive and lasting possession of the priestly dignity. Without Magi no one could make a sacrifice ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 132" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 132</bibl>), for they alone possessed the priestly mysteries; they also were soothsayers and interpreters of dreams. They had great respect and influence in public and private affairs; they conducted the education of the princes from the seventh year and constantly surrounded the king's person. They dressed in white and wore a felt turban, the cheek-pieces of which concealed the mouth (Avesta, paitidāna).</p>
 <p>Cyrus was undoubtedly an orthodox Zoroastrian; the belief in the resurrection arose under 
<pb n="1210" /><cb /> Cambyses ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 62</bibl>). Darins in his inscriptions constantly emphasizes the fact that he is ruler through the grace of Aüramazda; Ahriman is naturally not mentioned by name. The cult of the goddess Anaitis (Anāhita) and that of Mithra, which afterwards became almost international, was not officially introduced into Persia until the time of Artaxerxes II.</p>
 <p>In their descriptions of Persian sacrificial rites, the details given by Western writers agree in all essentials with the ordinances of the Avesta ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 131" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 131</bibl>; Strabo, p. 732; <title>De Is.</title> 46). The Persians had neither images of the gods nor real temples. They offered a garlanded sacrificial animal under the open heavens, while the Magi, holding in their hands a bundle of tamarisk twigs (the barsom), chanted the sacred passages. They sacrificed to the highest god, Ormuzd; to the sun and moon, but especially to fire and water—to fire, by burning dry wood and dropping fat on it; they offered worship to water, by some lake, river, or spring. The dog and the birds were sacred creatures; the dog they held as inviolable as men. On the other hand, it was considered a righteous deed to kill as many harmful animals as possible.</p>
 <p>The Perso-Iranian funeral rites are the strict consequence of the belief that all dead things were unclean and forfeited to the evil spirit. It was a mortal sin to defile the pure elements, fire and water. (Fire could not even be blown upon, under penalty of death.) The ecclesiastical prescriptions concerning burial, as later set down in the Avesta, seem for a long time to have been repugnant to the Persians, and only gradually to have supplanted the old customs. According to Xenophon ( <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 8. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cyrop.</title>viii. 7</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 25" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cyrop., 25</bibl>), Cyrus, when dying, ordered his body to be buried. Herodotus (i. 140) tells of the Magi that they do not bury their dead until dogs and birds have torn them. Whether the Persians did the same is not certain; at any rate they buried the corpse only after having covered it with wax. But the prescription of the Avesta indicates that the naked corpse was exposed to the vultures on an elevation (dakhma) outside the city, and that only subsequently the bones were buried in the open field. Not until the Sassanid period did this become the usual practice, as the description in Agathias, ii. 21, 22 proves. Procopius relates that a Persian who had buried his wife was sentenced to death (<title>Bell. Pers.</title> i. 7). When Damassius and his companions covered <cb /> a body lying on the ground with earth, the latter had disappeared in the morning, and during the night a spirit appeared to them in a dream, warning them to bury the dead, because the earth, the mother of all, received no tribute (Agathias, ii. 31). Evidence is not wanting that the custom existed as early as the time of Alexander, at least in Bactria. Alexander's Grecian governor in Bactria was almost driven out because he wished to forbid the exposure of the dead ( <title>De Abst.</title> iv. 21).</p>
 <p>The Zoroastrian priesthood and sect fell into decay with the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. Under the Sassanids it was restored, and under the royal protection reached a position of power as the organized State religion which it had never possessed before. It gradually succumbed to the advance of Islam, and in the Persia of to-day there are very few Zoroastrians. More numerous are the <figure id="fig.01210">

</figure> adherents of the old national religion, who have found refuge in and about Bombay—the Parsees.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—The history of Persia is lost in the little-known period of Median supremacy. The Persian kings are vassals of the Median kings, who, on their side, freed themselves from Assyrian dominion after long struggles. The founder of the Median dynasty is Deioces, who, in the first half of the seventh century B.C., raised the Median tribes from confusion and anarchy to an organized state under a central royal power ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 96" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 96</bibl> foll.), for a time probably still a tributary vassal of the Assyrian king, but paving the way for the Median war of independence from the Assyrian yoke. He built the royal capital Ecbatana (old HagmatPers. āna, later Hamadān). His son Phraortes (646-625) was the real founder of the Median supremacy. He subdued Persis and portions of the rest of Irān (“all Asia, one 
<pb n="1211" /><cb /> tribe after the other,” <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 102" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 102</bibl>), and finally entered into an attack on Assyria, for which, however, he paid with his life. His successor Cyaxares (624-585) was the most important king of Media, and raised the young nation to the highest power. He gave the country a firm organized military system. His expedition against Assyria, which brought him victorious before Nineveh, had to be broken off, as the Scythians were meantime invading and devastating all Irān. Cyaxares freed his land from this plague by stratagem ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 106" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 106</bibl>). Even then he made Armenia and Cappadocia as far as the Halys subject to himself, and is said to have pushed his dominion eastward over Hyrcania, Parthia, and Bactria. In alliance with Nabopolassar of Babylon, he destroyed Nineveh, and divided the Assyrian Empire among his allies. His son Astyages (584- 550) was the last king of his race. Herodotus tells only of his fall, which was brought about by the son of his vassal in the small but energetic district of Persis.</p>
 <p>Cyrus (Kūrush), 559-530, belonged to the highest order of Persian nobility—the Pasargadae. His family, which already occupied a leading position in Persis, traced its origin to Achaemenes (Hakhāmani). Xenophon ( <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cyrop.</title>i. 2</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cyrop., 1</bibl>), in opposition to Herodotus (i. 91-107), makes the father of Cyrus king of Persia. Babylonian inscriptions call his great-grandfather Teispes “king of the city of Anshan.” According to this, the Achaemenids had long ruled as kings in Persis under the suzerainty of the great kings of Media.</p>
 <p>Myths early gathered about the youth of Cyrus and his ascension to the throne. The romantic story in Herodotus (i. 107-130) is familiar. The Persians under Cyrus revolt against Astyages; he sends against them Harpagus, who, however, from private enmity, is favourable to Cyrus. A large part of the Median army goes over to Cyrus, and Astyages is conquered and taken alive. The <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> is told differently in DamascenusNicol. , <title>Fragm.</title> 66 (after Ctesias). But Xenophon's account makes Cyrus gain the power most easily of all by marrying the daughter and heiress of the last Median king Cyaxares, a son of Astyages, receiving Media as a dowry ( <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 8. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cyrop.</title>viii. 5</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 19" default="NO" valid="yes"> Cyrop., 19</bibl>). But Herodotus and Xenophon agree that Cyrus, on his mother's side, was a grandson of Astyages. The account of Herodotus is corrected and in part confirmed by the Babylonian inscriptions (cf. Rawlinson in the <title>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Soc. XII.</title>, new series, p. 70; PinchesTh. , <title>Transactions of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch. VII.</title>, Bauer Ad., <title>Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie</title>, 1882, p. 497).</p>
 <p>In these inscriptions it is related that Astyages took the field against Cyrus, but his soldiers revolted and surrendered him to Cyrus. Briefly, therefore, the circumstances were probably the following. In the year 559 Cyrus succeeds his father Cambyses as viceroy in Persis. He frees Persis and Susia, which was connected with it, from the Median suzerainty, and so becomes the first sovereign king of Persis and Susia. Astyages makes war upon him, and in the decisive battle at Pasargadae (Strabo, p. 730) loses his liberty and his Empire (550). After a short existence and rapid growth the Median sovereignty had given place to the Persian. In Media itself the acquirement of Ecbatana, which was shortly afterwards accomplished, seems to have completed <cb /> the transfer of the powers without any long resistance; the Medes soon became reconciled to the new order. For them the change meant not a foreign domination, but only a change of dynasty; the political aim of the Median Empire—the conquest of Asia—remained undisturbed. Since all accounts agree that Astyages had no son, Cyrus was the natural pretender for the throne, and only anticipated his time somewhat. And with the new Persian sovereign the place of the unloved Astyages (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 123" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 123</bibl>; Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> v. 8, 15) was occupied by a man who combined daring energy with paternal kindness. The Persian nobles, indeed, played the first parts, and Persian soldiers formed the military nucleus of the Empire. On the other hand, the less civilized victors willingly submitted themselves to the higher culture of the conquered. The Persians adopted their dress, customs, and vices from the Medes, together with the whole system of court and State, as they had already adopted their religion. Although to foreign eyes the Median name long retained its lustre, the national wall of division between Persians and Medes seems gradually to have fallen away and both races to have been mingled in a national unity. The court resided for a portion of the year in Media. Medes occupied high State positions and commands. From this time Persia, Susia, and Media formed the powerful kernel of the nation.</p>
 <p>Not so willingly did the other vassal States of the Median kingdom give their adherence to their new lords; their revolts caused Cyrus many wars ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 177" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 177</bibl>; <bibl n="Just.  1. 7" default="NO">Just.i. 7</bibl>). Even before Cyrus was involved in the second great war, the former vassal countries westward to the Halys were subject to him. Here followed at once the collision with his powerful neighbour Lydia. Once already, under Cyaxares, a bloody war had broken out between the two rival Empires, which continued with varying results for five years, and was finally calmed through the diplomatic intervention of the kings of Babylon and Cilicia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 74</bibl>). The fall of his brother-in-law and the rapid rise of the insatiable Cyrus forced the ruler of Sardis, Croesus, into war. After assuring himself of the alliance of Babylon, Egypt, and Sparta ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 77</bibl> foll.), he crossed the Halys in the year 547, anticipating an attack of Cyrus, and carried devastation into Cappadocia, a Persian protectorate ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 76</bibl>). The first battle occurred at Pteria, but was not decisive ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 76</bibl>). There Croesus began the return march, to occupy winter-quarters in Lydia. Cyrus pursued with forced marches, gained a decisive victory over the Lydians at Sardis before the auxiliaries which had been requested arrived, and shut the king up in the capital, which, after a siege of two weeks, was stormed and plundered. Cyrus eventually showed mercy to the captured Croesus, and took him with him to court in Persia, leaving the complete subjection of Lydia to his Median governors Mazares and Harpagus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 162" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 162</bibl>). Not alone all the Greek towns on the west coast of Asia Minor, which were tributary to Lydia, but also Miletus, Lycia, Caria, and Cilicia recognized the Persian authority either willingly or by force. Cyrus himself, immediately after the capture of Sardis, was summoned to the eastern part of the monarchy, to Bactria, by new 
<pb n="1212" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01212">

</figure>
 revolts. All of Upper Asia to the eastern border of Irān is from this time on under his sway. Sardis became the firm centre of the western half of the Empire. Lydia was divided into two provinces, the governors of which resided at Sardis and Dascyleion ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 120" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 120</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Now, when his Empire reached from the Iaxartes to the west coast of Asia Minor, only Babylon stood between him and the supreme power in Asia. In the year 539 Cyrus made an incursion into Babylonian territory ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 190" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 190</bibl> foll.; Berosus, <title>Fragm.</title> 14). In the very first battle the troops of the enemy mutinied. King Nabonidus of Babylon fled. The strong capital surrendered without resistance, and the whole Babylonian territory, together with the vassal States, of which Syria was the most important, yielded willingly to Cyrus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 19</bibl>), who, in this case also, showed himself not as a barbarous, oppressive conqueror, but as the new father of the country. He allowed the sanctuaries and palaces of Babylon to remain unharmed. It was quite in the character of the ancient Persians, who were not in the least religious fanatics, that he should tolerate and protect the old Babylonian religion. Cyrus was accustomed to treat the dispossessed princes with consideration, and to retain them in his service as governors. Through his wise policy, he was able to make moral conquests, and became the least sanguinary of the great conquerors of the Orient. His followers also, notably Darius, pursued this moderate policy in cases of conquest, not of rebellion.</p>
 <p>The crown treasures of the conquered lands Cyrus took as spoils of war and stored up in his palaces, thus laying the foundation of the inexhaustible reserves of money of the later Persian Empire. These supplies indirectly benefited the Persians, for it is said that as often as Cyrus entered the territory of Persia he gave a piece of gold to every Persian man and woman (<bibl n="Xen. Cy. 8.5.19" default="NO"><title>Cyrop.</title> viii. 5, 19</bibl>; <cb /> Damas. <title>Fragm.</title> 66). To his Persians he was always the national king; the heads of the nobility of Persis were nearest to the throne, and their counsel was of weight in important decisions.</p>
 <p>Cyrus is said to have met his death in an expedition against a nomad race beyond the Iaxartes— the Massagetae, according to Herodotus, the Derbiccae, according to Ctesias. At all events, it was one of the wild Turanian tribes which, with their plundering inroads, had long been the scourge of Northern Irān. But the reports are conflicting. His military science probably failed in the inhospitable steppes of Central Asia before the crafty tactics of these rider hordes. His army was cut to pieces; Herodotus says that he himself fell in the battle, Ctesias that he died from the wounds received there. His body was entombed at Pasargadae, in the shade of the park, in a chamber upon a small stone pyramid. There Alexander saw his golden coffin (Strabo, p. 730). Cyrus had two sons, Cambyses and Smerdis, by his wife Cassandané, who died before him. Of his daughters, Atossa is best known.</p>
 <p>He was succeeded by his eldest son, Cambyses (Kabujiya), B.C. 529-522, an imperious, passionate man, whose notorious intemperance ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 34</bibl>) at times developed into delirium. While the Persians considered Cyrus as their father, they looked on the new sovereign as their master ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 89" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 89</bibl>). Cambyses inherited the active disposition of his father. His first expedition against Egypt involved immense armies. The Phoenician ports, as well as Cyprus, which had recently revolted from Egypt and voluntarily submitted to Persia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 19</bibl>), were obliged to mobilize their fleets to afford naval support to the land attack. Samos also at the time entered into voluntary alliance with Persia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 44</bibl>). Cambyses first caused his younger brother Smerdis (Bardiya), whose loyalty he distrusted, to be murdered 
<pb n="1213" /><cb /> secretly by Prexaspes. A Greek fugitive, Thanes, led the army through the Arabian Desert ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 4</bibl>). At Pelusium Cambyses met the army of Psammetichus III., who had shortly before succeeded King Amasis. The Egyptian army was completely vanquished, Memphis was taken after a short siege, and Psammetichus made prisoner. In the year 525 the old kingdom of the Pharaohs was made a province of the Persian Empire. In general, Cambyses held to the policy of recognizing and respecting foreign nationality; no change was made in religion or government except that a satrap took the place of the Pharaohs. But the unbridled king personally outraged the people by brutal excesses, such as the desecration of the corpse of Amasis ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 16</bibl>) and his private mockery of their sacred things.</p>
 <p>From Egypt Cambyses planned great expeditions to the west and south. The naval expedition against Carthage was abandoned, because the Phoenicians refused to move against their own colony. A land force perished utterly in the sands of the Libyan Desert ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 26</bibl>). The expedition under his own command against Aethiopia was not entirely fruitless, but entailed heavy losses ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 25</bibl>). These failures increased his madness to a still higher point; he killed the bull Apis in rage ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 27</bibl>), and by ill-treatment caused the death of his own sister, whom he had married according to Persian custom.</p>
 <p>Cambyses remained in Egypt until the year 522, when suddenly disquieting reports came from Persia, which, in consequence of his long absence, seems for a long time to have been in a state of fermentation. A Magian, Gaumāta, whose brother was the steward of Cambyses, took advantage of the universal dissatisfaction, and, favoured by a certain resemblance to the murdered Smerdis ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 61</bibl> even gives him the same name), proclaimed himself to be the latter, and inflamed the land against the rightful king. Only a few initiated persons knew of the murder of Smerdis. Through great mildness and still greater promises the usurper quickly succeeded. Persia, Media, and the provinces gave him their allegiance, and Cambyses was practically a dethroned prince. From this point we can test the statements of Herodotus by the inscriptions of Darius. While on his homeward journey to punish the usurper, he met his death in Syria by his own hand, or through carelessness, as Herodotus (iii. 64) thinks. The position of the Achaemenid dynasty was precarious. The people considered the pretender the real Bardiya, who would now have been the legitimate successor to the throne, as Cambyses died childless. Certain expressions of doubt seem to have been checked by the new tyrant with great cruelty. He must have feared most of all being unmasked by the Persian grandees, and therefore he never received them, nor allowed himself to be seen publicly, which was quite contrary to etiquette. Herodotus makes him reside in Susa, but according to the inscriptions his fate overtook him in a Median fortress. Seven <cb /> Persian nobles, with Darius at their head, who had secretly discovered the truth, formed a conspiracy, surprised the castle, and struck Gaumāta down.</p>
 <p>It had been neither a Median revolt against Persian sovereignty ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 130" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 130</bibl>) nor a religious uprising of the Magi, but the game of chance of a political adventurer, whom fortune favoured for a short time through a rare combination of circumstances. But for the moment the whole wrath of the insulted Persian nobility was turned against the Magi, and it would have needed little to end the day with a night of St. Bartholomew for all the Magi ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 79" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 79</bibl>). Darius, the head of the conspiracy, was proclaimed king. The story of Herodotus that the choice was to be made among the seven by lot or chance is a later addition. In fact Darius was the only rightful heir to the throne. He was descended from a collateral branch of the Achaemenids, which from the time of Teïspes had separated from the now extinct chief line. The genealogy of the family, according to Herodotus and the inscriptions, is the following: <figure /></p>
 <p>When he ascended the throne as governor of Persis his father was still alive ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 70" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 70</bibl>), but appears to have resigned all claim to the succes<figure id="fig.01213">
<head orig="Persian Intaglio Cylinder. (Dieulafoy.)">Persian Intaglio Cylinder. (Dieulafoy.)</head>
</figure> sion to the avenger of his order. The other conspirators were rewarded with hereditary privileges.</p>
 <p>The new king, Darius I. (Dārayavaüsh), (521-485), was in his thirtieth year. He entered into the inheritance of the Achaemenids at a critical period. The short interregnum had relaxed the empire of Cyrus in all its points. The provinces were everywhere uneasy—rebels and pretenders sprang up in every direction. The revolt first broke out in Susiana, but was quickly repressed. The uprising in Babylon was more serious, where a pretended son of Nabonidus placed himself at the head of the rebels; the fortress was taken only after a hard siege—according to Herodotus, through the craft of Zopyrus. While Darius was still fighting in Babylonia, Persia and Media revolted at the same 
<pb n="1214" /><cb /> time. The rebellion spread eastward to Margiana, westward over Armenia and Assyria, only the outer provinces remaining quiet. It seemed that the end of the empire had come, but the young king remained unshaken through all the storms, and the Persian and Median armies stood faithful. Only a great man could meet this gigantic task. Through years of sharp fighting he forced the seceding countries to return, one after the other, and disarmed the rebels. Later on he set up a proud memorial of these deeds in the great rock-inscriptions of Behistan.</p>
 <p>By the end of the year 519 the great rebellion had been crushed forever; the Empire, twentythree countries from the Nile to the Iaxartes, was again under his undisputed sway. He proceeded at once to unite the Empire more closely by reorganizing the government, and in accordance with the traditions of his house to extend his boundaries. To the east the Empire was extended to the Indus after he had carefully explored the lands of the Indus by ship ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 44</bibl>), and the same were annexed ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 139" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 139</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The great expedition to the Danube against the Scythians, on the other hand, was only partially successful. There were probably various reasons for this expedition. Perhaps those mysterious, restless savages, who, from the time of Cyaxares, had been held in hostile memory, again attracted attention; perhaps this far-seeing man intended to surround Greece from the north, and so wished to secure first the right flank. Darius is said to have placed 700,000 men in the field, while his Ionian subjects supplied 600 ships ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 87" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 87</bibl>). From the latter the Samian engineer Mandrocles constructed the famous bridge of ships over the Bosporus, on which in 515 Darius crossed to Europe. While the land force travelled north over the Balkan, the Ionians received command to break up the bridge, to put into the Danube, and to construct another bridge there. On the Danube the Getae alone offered an obstinate resistance, and he proceeded across the river into a wholly unknown region, while the Ionians were to wait sixty days for his return, and hold the bridge during that period. Most of the operations in the present Bessarabia were brought to nothing by the skilful equestrian tactics of the enemy, who came and disappeared with the speed of lightning, and never allowed themselves to be grasped. The Persian army was thus led deeper and deeper into the inhospitable steppes, and at last forced by lack of supplies and exhaustion to return. After heavy losses Darius succeeded in getting back to the bridge over the Danube, which fortunately, thanks to the faithfulness of Histiaeus of Miletus, had not yet been broken up. The sole result was the subjugation of the Thracian cities by Megabazus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 10</bibl>), followed by that of the Grecian ports Paeonia and Macedonica ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 15</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  26. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., xxvi. 18</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Persia and Greece had thus come into dangerous proximity, and the inevitable collision from the Persian side must have been long foreseen. A slight cause set the stone rolling. Exiled Greeks from Naxos applied to Aristagoras, governor of Miletus, for Persian aid against their city, whose freedom they were willing to sacrifice to their private revenge. The Persian king gave them assistance through the satrap of Sardis. The command was, however, divided between Aristagoras <cb /> and Megabates, and the rivalry of the two generals caused the failure of the undertaking. The offended Aristagoras revenged himself: in the year 500 he gave the signal for a general uprising of the Ionian cities, which he had for some time been planning with Histiaeus. In the freedom-loving Greek cities the tyrants introduced by Persia (cf. <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 98" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 98</bibl>) had long been found a burden, and the spirit of revolt found in them ample nourishment. First a republic was proclaimed in Miletus, and the fleet returning from Naxos was seized. At the same time aid was asked from the mother-country, but only Athens and Eretria responded with twenty-five ships, which were the beginning of all misfortune for Greeks and barbarians ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 97" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 97</bibl>). The forces of Aristagoras moved upon Sardis and burned the city. Next the Greek cities on the Hellespont and almost the whole of Cyprus and Caria joined the revolt. But soon the Persian army was in the field, operating in conjunction with the fleet provided by Phoenicia. Cyprus was first reconquered, and the revolt suppressed in Asia Minor by three Persian armies after battles of varying results. The decisive naval battle occurred at Ladé, where the Ionian fleet was completely overcome by the combined Phoenician, Cyprian, and Egyptian fleets. Miletus, the home of the revolt, was taken and destroyed, after holding out for six years, 500-494 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 20</bibl>). The vengeance of the victors was terrible; Milesian maidens were carried off to the Persian harems, the men banished, and the flourishing country of the Ionians devastated and depopulated. For the Athenians and Eretrians also the Persian monarch had planned a similar chastisement. In the spring of 492 the land forces under Mardonius set out, supported by an enormous fleet. But the army had little success in Thrace, and the fleet was shipwrecked at Athos. A second and larger expedition started in 490 under Datis and Artaphernes, this time by sea only. The course was laid past Naxos, which was conquered. Then Eretria was burned, and its inhabitants carried off to the interior of Asia. This expedition came to its end on the memorable Plain of Marathon (490). The Greek victory has evidently been greatly exaggerated. Probably the Greeks, after having avoided battle for a long time, fell upon the Persians as they were departing, when the greater part of the army, especially the powerful cavalry, had already embarked. The Persian generals contented themselves with the results in Naxos and Euboea and abandoned the campaign. If Darius had commanded in person, the result would probably have been a different one.</p>
 <p>Another piece of bad news troubled the closing days of the king's life. Egypt, which up to this time had borne the easy yoke, now rose against Persia. Thus the unyielding monarch saw himself confronted with a twofold war, but in the midst of extensive preparations he was overtaken by death after a reign of thirty-six years (485). With him died the greatest ruler that Irān ever produced, the ideal of an enlightened despot, trained in a hard school, filled with his high calling, wise in his choice of means and persons, fitted by his energy and wariness for the greatest achievements.</p>
 <p>Darius was not alone a conqueror like Cyrus, an augmenter of his Empire, which he raised from 
<pb n="1215" /><cb /> twenty-three to thirty lands, but also a wise and practical organizer. His predecessors had appointed governors (satraps) as need arose; Darius divided the kingdom into fixed governmental districts (satrapies), and regulated the powers of the satraps (<hi rend="italic">khshathrapāvan</hi>). They held a prince's court in the provincial capitals, and were the chief heads of the government, the law, and the military in their provinces. They were responsible immediately to the sovereign. In order to prevent any possible schemes of independence, Darius caused them to be watched by persons in whom he reposed special confidence. He himself made annual tours of inspection. The commanders of fortresses in the provinces were appointed directly by the king. Besides, he fixed definitely the tax to be imposed on each province, and so assured the Empire as well as the crown a definite revenue, whereas formerly the taxes had consisted in so-called presents ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 89" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 89</bibl>) —i. e. voluntary tribute. Only the original Persia was untaxed. The rest of the provinces paid a land tax in proportion to the yield of the soil, Babylonia being taxed most heavily. There were, besides, indirect taxes, duties, taxes on products, etc. The direct taxes alone amounted annually to about twelve million dollars.</p>
 <p>Intercourse and trade were fostered by Darius by means of military roads and canals. His courier post was renowned, by means of which he sent his commands through the whole Empire in the shortest possible time ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 98" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 98</bibl>).</p>
 <p>His descendants were quite numerous. Some of his sons were born when he was still a private citizen. The succession descended according to Persian custom to Xerxes, the first son born after his accession to the throne.</p>
 <p>Xerxes (Khshayārsha) (485-465) was the eldest son of the imperious Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, who had been successively the wife of Cambyses, Pseudo-Smerdis, and Darius. Soon after his accession Egypt was subdued (484). He was at first little disposed to continue the war against Greece, but finally followed the promptings of the war-party under the ambitious Mardonius, and for fully four years was actively employed in making preparations. The army was concentrated at Sardis. In the spring of 480 Xerxes marched with the land forces through Thrace and Macedonia, while the fleet sailed to Therma. The defeat of the Spartans at Thermopylae, where the Persians avenged Marathon, and the doubtful result of the sea-fight at Artemisium, were compensated by the brilliant victories of Salamis, Plataeae, and Mycalé. The chances of war were by no means so unfavourable to Greece as they had appeared in the momentary discouragement at first. The numerical advantage of the Persians was very great; but the patriotic legend has enormously exaggerated the number of actual combatants in making it reach the total of two and a half millions ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 185" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 185</bibl>). It was, moreover, a contest between a people fighting for their country and a soldiery brought together from all quarters, partly by force, who had little to lose by defeat. The boastful Persian generals committed a mistake <cb /> in wholly undervaluing their antagonists. In organization, tactics, and generalship the Greeks were far superior to the Asiatics, and the great masses of the Persian army could not be used to the best advantage in the Grecian territory. Even before Plataeae Xerxes had lost all courage and quickly removed his Persians to a place of safety, leaving Mardonius with the choicest Persian troops. He retired at once to his luxurious capitals in the interior, sinking into the inactive life of the harem, while the Greeks, especially under the leadership of Timon, made greater and greater progress in the liberation of their countrymen on the islands and the Asiatic coast. The European possessions of the Persians were lost forever.</p>
 <p>In the year 465 Xerxes and his eldest son Darius were murdered in a revolt in the palace. Under Xerxes began the chain of misrule, seldom interrupted, which slowly undermined the existence of the nation. The fate of the dynasty was determined almost alone by palace revolts, court intrigues, and the rule of women and favourites. The inner history of the Empire, its growing decay, is hidden from our knowledge, as Herodotus, the fullest source of information, breaks off with the battle of Mycalé, and the Persian inscriptions after Xerxes become more and more scanty. In its external history the Greeks remain the chief factor; Persian money and intrigues play an important part in Greece.</p>
 <p>Xerxes was succeeded by his youngest son Artaxerxes I. Longimanus (Artakhshathra) (464-425). In his long reign only two events are important— a revolt in Egypt, supported by Athens, but repressed by the battle of Memphis, and the conclusion of peace with Athens (449), through which the Aegean and the Greek colonies in Asia were taken from the Persian dominion. <figure id="fig.01215">
<head orig="Seal of Artaxerxes I. (Dieulafoy.)">Seal of Artaxerxes I. (Dieulafoy.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>His only legitimate son, Xerxes II., was murdered after a very short reign by his half-brother, Secydianus; but the murderer was himself put to death by another illegitimate son of Artaxerxes, Orthus, previously satrap of Hyrcania. Orthus himself ascended the throne as Darius II. (Nothus), (423-405). In his reign an opportunity was offered to Persia of regaining its lost power in the Aegean and the whole west coast. When in the Peloponnesian War the hegemony of Persia's hereditary enemy, Athens, was broken, the Persian court entered into relations with Sparta through the satraps Tissaphernes of Lydia and Pharnabazus of Phrygia. In return for subsidies Sparta was to give over to Persia all the coast region lost by the peace of 449. For a long time the alliance accepted by Sparta could not be put into effect, owing to the 
<pb n="1216" /><cb /> rivalry of the two satraps and the perfidy of Tissaphernes, and the Athenians for a time had a decided advantage. A change came only when the Persian prince, Cyrus, an energetic and ambitious young man, received the chief command of the troops of Asia Minor. He sought a close alliance with Sparta; subsidies were freely given, and with this assistance Sparta was enabled to force Athens to a peace.</p>
 <p>About this time Darius II. died, and his death occasioned the well-known contest for the throne. His wife Parysatis, an imperious, intriguing woman, had borne him two sons, the elder, Arsicas, before his accession, and younger, Cyrus, when queen. Her efforts to gain the succession for her younger and far more gifted favourite son Cyrus, as being the real king's son, had no result. Arsicas ascended the throne as Artaxerxes II. (Mnemon) in 405. He placed his younger brother as satrap over Asia Minor. But Tissaphernes, the professed friend of Cyrus, defamed him to his brother, and it was only through the protection of his mother that he escaped imprisonment. Returning to his satrapy, he assured himself of troops from every side in Greece, in order to gain forcible possession of the throne. In the spring of 401 he began an expedition with 13,000 Greek auxiliaries and his own army of Asiatics, ostensibly against rebels in his own satrapy. Again he was betrayed by Tissaphernes. At Cunaxa Cyrus met an enormous royal army. The mere appearance of the Greek soldiers put the Asiatics to terror and flight; but Cyrus ventured too far into the conflict, and fell. The sudden end of this knightly youth, who was entitled to great hopes, is tragic. The adventurous return of 10,000 Greeks is familiar from Xenophon's <title>Anabasis.</title></p>
 <p>Sparta had openly sided with Cyrus against the great king, and the relations between the two States were therefore strained. Tissaphernes, returned to his post of satrap in Asia Minor, demanded submission from all the Ionian cities which had gone over to Cyrus. They refused, and asked help of Sparta, which, in spite of the still existing alliance, forbade Tissaphernes to attack the cities; and, as Tissaphernes paid no attention to this prohibition, war broke out in 401 between Sparta and Persia. The war dragged along, and the Spartans gained no important results until Agesilaus received the chief command, when they invested the provinces of Asia Minor. In its difficulties the Persian court now made use of Athenian aid. The Athenian admiral Conon commanded the newly equipped Persian fleet, and conquered the Spartans at Cnidos (397). Mutual exhaustion ended the war with the peace of Antalcidas (387), which the Persian king practically dictated. In it Persia claimed the whole Asiatic sea-coast and some islands, such as Cyprus, as its property.</p>
 <p>The last years of Artaxerxes were occupied with numerous revolts among the satraps. Personally he is said to have been mild and peaceloving ( <title>Artax.</title> 30). He showed fatal weakness towards the women of the court, and his life was a series of intrigues and quarrels. In his last days he named his oldest son Darius as his successor, but the latter became involved in a conspiracy against his father, and was beheaded. His ambitious son Ochus caused the murder of two older brothers who stood in his way, and after his father's death in 358 ascended the throne <cb /> as Artaxerxes III. He was a thorough despot, pursuing his ends without scruple, shrinking at no cruelty. By his severity and by his wise policy he lifted the decaying kingdom once more to its former power. At his accession all the western part of the Empire was in turmoil. Hardly was the rebellious satrap of Phrygia conquered when Phoenicia and Cyprus revolted. His generals were unsuccessful in their operations against the rebelling king Tennes of Sidon and Mentor of Rhodes. The monarch placed himself at the head of a large army, which was strengthened by Greek soldiers supplied in accordance with the terms of the alliance. Sidon fell through the treachery of Tennes, and was fearfully punished. The fall of the capital soon reduced the rest of Phoenicia, and Cyprus was reconquered.</p>
 <p>The most important task before Artaxerxes was to reconquer Egypt, which, for more than sixty years, had remained independent. His two generals Bagoas and Mentor, who had come over to his side, operated so skilfully under his command on the field, and not less with threats, that king Nectanebus of Egypt soon abandoned his cause as lost and fled to Aethiopia. The defenceless land, after a severe punishment, was again made part of the Persian Empire. Mentor became satrap of the sea-coast of Asia Minor; Bagoas remained near the king as minister, and appears to have been the originator of the plot to kill the king by poison, which was carried out in 338; Bagoas, who remained master of the situation, placed Arses, the youngest son of Artaxerxes, on the throne (338-336). But as the latter did not show himself pliant, he was removed in the third year of his reign.</p>
 <p>Bagoas now placed on the throne a distant relative of the murdered king, Darius III. (Codomannus), a great-grandson of Darius II. (336-320). When Bagoas once more attempted his old manoeuvre, he was himself forced to drink the poison. Darius was perhaps the most worthy of the Achaemenids at the time to fill the high station, but he was not man enough to ward off the threatening evils. Even at the time of his accession there was imminent danger of war from the uprisings in Macedonia. The <seg lang="la">casus belli</seg>, if, indeed, any was needed, dated from the time of Artaxerxes III. When, in the year 340, Philip was besieging the town of Perinthus, opposite the Persian territory, Persian auxiliaries, in union with Athens, had relieved the town. Philip himself had planned an expedition against the Persian king, ostensibly as the avenger of Greece. On the threshold of his undertaking Philip was assassinated, apparently not without instigation on the part of Persia (Arrian, <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 2. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>ii. 14</bibl>). The young Alexander, whom Darius at first wholly undervalued, at once took up the great plans of his father as soon as Greece was completely pacified. Darius in vain sought to counteract his extensive preparations. Darius's right-hand and first general was the Rhodian Memnon, a brother of Mentor, a man as skilful and energetic as his renowned brother. He alone planned earnestly for the safety of the Empire, when indecision, suspicion, and great egoism controlled the other Persian commanders.</p>
 <p>In the spring of 334 Alexander crossed the Hellespont with not more than 30,000 infantry, 4500 horsemen, and 182 ships. At the Granicus, where, 
<pb n="1217" /><cb /> against the advice of Memnon and with no plan of action, the Persian army offered battle, Alexander gained his first brilliant victory. Sardis capitulated without a blow. In Ephesus he was greeted as a liberator; Miletus and Halicarnassus alone defended themselves bravely. At the end of the year Alexander was in possession of Asia Minor as far as the Taurus. Only Memnon threatened him with danger. Memnon crossed to the sea unhindered, and was on the point of carrying the war into Europe behind Alexander's back when death overtook him. His death was the most severe blow to the Persian cause. Nothing now obstructed Alexander's victorious course. In an unfavourable position at Issus, Darius himself opposed him with an immense army, and was completely routed with great losses (333). The Persian army was scattered, and Darius fled across the Euphrates. In order to protect the rear, Alexander occupied Phoenicia and Egypt (332). In the spring of 331 he marched towards the heart of the Persian monarchy, after having rejected various overtures of peace from the Persian king. Darius had concentrated in Assyria another immense army from the inexhaustible resources of the Persian Empire. The decisive battle of Arbela and Gaugamela completely shattered the Persian colossus. Darius did not even await the issue of the day, but was among the first to flee to Media. Without a blow, Babylon and Susa opened their gates. In the middle of the winter Alexander stood before the passes of Persis, in which the satrap Ariobarzanes, with a small army, successfully opposed him. Alexander imitated the Persian manoenvre of Thermopylae. Persepolis capitulated, and immense treasures fell into Alexander's hands. At his command the royal citadel was burned, and the town was given over to plunder. Persis was completely reduced to subjection. In the spring of 330 Alexander went to Ecbatana, and pressed hard in pursuit of the fleeing Darius. Meantime Bessus, satrap of Bactria, had gained possession of the government of all Ariana, and had been taken prisoner by Darius in his retreat. When Alexander was close at his heels Bessus struck Darius down. Alexander found only the corpse of the last of the Achaemenids. Bessus for a time maintained himself as King Artaxerxes IV. in the far east of Irān, and organized the defence of Bactria and Sogdiana with much skill. But beyond the Oxus he was surrendered by his own people, and later on was crucified in Ecbatana. Bactria quickly yielded, but Sogdiana for a long time offered stout resistance, and not until 327 did it, the last bulwark of Iranian independence, fall completely into the hands of the great Macedonian.</p>
 <p>Persian history from this time is absorbed in the history of Alexander, the Diadochi, and the Parthian kingdom under the Arsacids. Not until the year A.D. 224 was a new Persian nation born, under the dynasty of the Sasanids.</p>

 <p>A well known Roman satirist, the third in order among the writers of that form of literature. He was born A.D. 34 at Volaterrae, in Etruria, of a good equestrian family. Losing his father when six years old, at the age of twelve he went to Rome, and enjoyed the instruction of the most eminent teachers, more especially of one for whom he had the greatest reverence, Annaeus <ref type="cross" target="crosscornutus">Cornutus</ref> (q.v.), who initiated him in the Stoic philosophy and introduced him to the acquaintance of Lucan. After the first poetic attempts of his youth, which he himself burned, his energies were directed to satiric verse, under the influence of Lucilius and Horace. On his early death, in the year 62, the six satires which he left, after some slight revision by Cornutus, were published by his friend, the poet Caesius Bassus. A short introduction in fourteen scazonic trimeters is possibly spurious. In these Persius deals with the moral corruption of his age, from the standpoint of a Stoic preacher of ethics. Both in thought and expression a tendency to echo Horace is constantly apparent. (See Werther, <title>De Persio Horatii Imitatore</title> [Halle, 1883].) He composed slowly, and appears to be himself conscious that he has no true poetic faculty. His mode of expression is frequently difficult and involved to the verge of obscurity. The need of explanations was accordingly felt in comparatively early times; but the collection of scholia bearing the name of Cornutus shows hardly any traces of ancient learning. Many of the terse phrases and lines of Persius have passed into literature, the most famous being the <title>O quantum est in rebus inane</title> (i. 1); <seg lang="la">pulchrum est digito monstrari</seg> (i. 28); <seg lang="la">rara avis</seg> (i. 46); <seg lang="la">tecum habita; noris quam sit tibi curta supellex</seg> (iv. 52); and the striking lines in the Third Satire (35-38). In fact, many of the epigrammatic lines of Juvenal seem to have been suggested by the earlier satirist. (See Wilcke's monograph [Stendal, 1869].) The language of Persius is often tinged with the vocabulary and usage of the plebeian Latin, as he writes in the character of a plain, blunt man—the very opposite of his real self. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.</p>
 <p>The best MSS. of Persius are the Codex Montepessulanus (of Montpellier) and a Codex Vaticanus, of the ninth or tenth centuries. Few classic authors are represented by so many codices, as the moral tone of Persius made him a favourite throughout the Middle Ages.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πρόσωπον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προσωπεῖον</foreign>).

 <p>Death-masks of gold have been found in tombs at Mycenae and elsewhere; at Carthage masks of clay were also similarly used. In Egypt they were placed upon the case containing the mummy. See also <ref type="cross" target="crossimagines">Imagines</ref>. <figure id="fig.01218">

 <p>For theatrical purposes, masks were made of linen, of bark, of leather, and sometimes of wood. Their introduction in dramatic performances is ascribed to <ref type="cross" target="crosschoerilus">Choerilus</ref> (q.v.) of Samos about B.C. 500, and to <ref type="cross" target="crossaeschylus">Aeschylus</ref> (q.v.); but their use really goes back to the mummery in honour of Dionysus, at whose festivals in early Greece the face was painted with the lees of wine or covered with leaves. The opening for the eyes was not larger than the pupil of the actor's eyes behind the mask. The masks themselves sometimes merely covered the face, like masks in modern times; but sometimes, also, they covered the whole head down to the shoulders. The wig worn by the tragic actors <figure id="fig.01218.2">
<head orig="Masks. (Pompeii.)">Masks. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> was usually if not always a part of the mask. Phrynichus is said by Suidas (s. v.) to have first made comic masks. The varieties of masks were very numerous, representing every possible sort of character, age, sex, and condition. Pollux (iv. 133, etc.) enumerates twenty-eight typical kinds of mask, six for old men, eight for young men, eleven for women, and three for slaves. Gellius thinks that the mouth of the mask was arranged so as to intensify the sound of the actor's voice (v. 7); but this is doubtful. <figure id="fig.01218.3">

 <p>At Rome masks were not used in early times, but only wigs. They were probably first introduced in B.C. 110 by Roscius, who was homely and had a squint.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Πέτρα</foreign>). The name of several cities built on rocks, or in rocky places, of which the most celebrated was in Arabia Petraea, the capital, first of the Idumaeans, and afterwards of the Nabathaeans. It lies in the midst of the mountains of Seir, just half way between the Dead Sea and the head of the Aelanitic Gulf of the Red Sea, in a valley or, rather, ravine, surrounded by almost inaccessible precipices, which is entered by a narrow gorge on the east, the rocky walls of which approach so closely as in some places hardly to permit two horsemen to ride abreast. On the banks of the river which runs through this ravine stood the city itself, and some fine ruins of its public buildings still remain. These ruins are chiefly of the Roman period, when Petra had become an important city as a centre of the caravan traffic of the Nabathaeans. It maintained its independence under the Romans till the time of Trajan, by whom it was taken. It was the chief city of Arabia Petraea; and under the later Empire the capital of Palaestina Tertia.

After the loss of the battle of Pharsalia (48), Petreius crossed over to Africa, and took an active part in the campaign in 46, which was brought to an end by the decisive defeat of the Pompeian

<head orig="Petronius">Petronius</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, or (possibly) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus</hi>. A Roman novelist probably to be identified with an accomplished voluptuary at the court of Nero. He was one of the chosen companions of Nero, and was regarded as director-in-chief of the imperial pleasures, the judge whose decision upon the merits of any proposed scheme of enjoyment was held as final (<seg lang="la">elegantiae arbiter</seg>). The influence thus acquired excited the jealous suspicions of Tigellinus. Petronius was accused of treason; and believing that destruction was inevitable, he resolved to die as he had lived, and to excite admiration by the frivolous eccentricity of his end. Having caused his veins to be opened, he from time to time checked the flow of blood by the application of bandages. During the intervals he conversed with his friends, and even showed himself in the public streets of Cumae, where these events took place; so that at last, when he collapsed from exhaustion, his death (A.D. 66), although compulsory, appeared to be the result of natural and gradnal decay. He is said to have despatched in his last moments a sealed document to the emperor, taunting him with his brutal excesses ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xvi. 18</bibl><bibl n="Tac. Ann. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. Ann., 19</bibl>; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 20</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The remarkable work which is traditionally ascribed to this person and which has come down to modern times in an incomplete form, was originally written in at least 16 books, with the title <title>Satira</title> or <title>Satiricon.</title> It is in prose, with many passages in verse scattered through it as quotations, or as compositions of characters introduced in the novel. The book is a sort of comic romance, in which the adventures of a certain Encolpius and his companions in the south of Italy, chiefly in Puteoli or its environs (on the place see H. W. Hayley in <title>Harvard Studies in Class. Philology</title> for 1892), are made a vehicle for exposing the false taste and vices of the age. Unfortunately the vices of the personages introduced are depicted with such fidelity that we are perpetually disgusted by the obscenity of the descriptions. The longest section is generally known as the Dinner of Trimalchio (<title>Cena Trimalchionis</title>), presenting us with a caricatured account of a fantastic banquet, such as the gourmands of the Empire were wont to exhibit on their tables. Next in interest is the well-known tale of the Ephesian Matron, which is really older than the time of Petronius, and is found in various forms in the literature of many peoples, even in the Chinese; and which in English is introduced into one of the sermons of Jeremy Taylor. It is probably the best if not the only remaining specimen of a Milesian Tale. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnovels-and-romances">Novels and Romances</ref>.) The novel is also remarkable for its pictures of low life, and for the specimens which it gives of the Latin of the uneducated classes (<seg lang="la">sermo plebeius</seg>), of which it is the most important literary example. The dialogue is amusing, abounding in idiomatic expressions, popular maxims, <cb /> ungrammatical language, and slang. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.</p>
 <p>A remarkable attempt at fraud by one François Nodot in the seventeenth century is associated with the history of the text of Petronius. Nodot professed to have got possession of a complete copy of Petronius with no <seg lang="la">lacunae</seg>, found, he said, at the sack of Belgrade. His text was printed at Rotterdam in 1693, but was at once seen to be a forgery; yet as it gives a continuous narrative instead of the fragmentary one of the genuine text its additions are sometimes printed (in different type) in editions of Petronius.</p>
 <p>There are twenty-one existing manuscripts of Petronius, the most important being the Codex Traguriensis in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. It was found at Trau in Dalmatia in 1663, and contains the <title>Cena Trimalchionis.</title> See Beck, <bibl default="NO"><title>The Age of Petronius</title> (Cambridge, Mass., 1856)</bibl>, and the account of the MSS. in Bücheler's large edition.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φαίακες, Φαίηκες</foreign>). A fabulous people in Homer, to whom Odysseus came in his wanderings (<bibl n="Homer Od. 5.280" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>vi.-viii.</bibl>). They were as like to the gods as the Giants and Cyclopes, seeing them face to face. Originally settled in Hyperia, they were compelled, by the violence of their neighbours, the Cyclopes, to migrate, under their king Nausithoüs, son of Poseidon and Periboea, daughter of Eurymedon, the last king of the Giants, to the happy island of Scheria, where they built a city. On the arrival of Odysseus, their ruler was Alcinoüs, the son of Nausithoüs; his wife was Areté, his brother's daughter, and besides many sons he was the father of the fair Nausicaa, Odysseus's preserver. Far from the turmoil of the world, the Phaeaces are described as leading a life of undisturbed happiness, in the enjoyment of the goods wherewith they are richly blessed; above all, Alcinoüs, who had the fairest of orchards and a most beautiful palace. Their business was solely with the sea, with shipping, and the provision of all that belongs to it. Their ships were of wondrous sort. Without steersman or rudder, divining of themselves the wishes and thoughts of all men, and knowing all lands, they traversed the sea swift as a bird or a thought, wrapped in mist and darkness, yet never suffered wreck or loss. When the ship, that brought the sleeping Odysseus in one night to Thrace, returned, Poseidon, of whose envious malice a prophecy had long ago bidden them beware, changed it to a rock in sight of harbour, and the Phaeaces were in fear that the rest of the saying would come true, and mountains rise up all round their city. Though it is obvious that the Phaeaces and their abodes, Hyperia and Scheria, are purely mythical, the kingdom of Alcinoüs was early identified as Corcyra (Corfu). He had a shrine there, and the harbour was named after him. Near the island was also shown the petrified ship. Hence the later Argonautic legends made even Iason and Medea touch at Corcyra on their flight from Aeëtes, and, like Odysseus, find protection and help from Alcinoüs.

<head orig="Phaedrus">Phaedrus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φαῖδρος</foreign>). (1) An Epicurean philosopher, who was head of the Epicurean School at Athens while Cicero was a student there (B.C. 80). He died in the year 70, and was succeeded by Patron. He wrote a treatise on the gods (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Θεῶν</foreign>), a fragment of which was found at Herculaneum in 1806. (Edition by Petersen [Hamburg, 1883].) From it Cicero largely drew his materials for the first book of the <title>De Natura Deorum.</title> See Schwenke in Jahn's <title>Neue Jahrbücher</title>, 119, 49; 129.</p>
 <p>(2) A Roman writer of poetical fables. By birth a Macedonian of the district of Pieria, he came early to Rome as a slave, and acquired a knowledge of Roman literature while still a boy. If the traditional title of his five books of fables after Aesop is to be trusted (<title>Phaedri, Augusti liberti, fabulae Aesopiae</title>), he was set free by Augustus. To Phaedrus belongs the credit of introducing fable-writing into Latin poetical literature—a fact of which he was fully conscious, but which secured him neither relief from his miserable position, nor recognition on the part of the educated public; his patrons seem to have been only freedmen like himself. In fact, he even drew upon himself, by his two first published books, the illwill and persecution of the all-powerful favourite of Tiberius, Seianus, who suspected in them malicious reference to contemporary events. In consequence, he did not publish the remaining books till after the fall of Seianus in A.D. 31 and the death of Tiberius in 37.</p>
 <p>The five books are preserved, though not in a complete form. Whether the further collection of thirty-two fables, transcribed from a MS. in the fifteenth century by Archbishop Nicolo Perotti (<title>Fabulae Perottianae</title>) —and published at Naples in 1809—are a genuine work of Phaedrus, is doubtful. The matter of the fables is only to a small extent borrowed from Aesop. Some include stories from history, partly referring to the present or immediate past. In relation to the Greek originals, the material is not always skilfully used, 
<pb n="1222" /><cb />
 especially in the “morals.” The drawing of the characters is at first very cramped, but is afterwards more broadly treated; the language fluent and, in general, correct; the metre, too (iambic senarius), used with strictness, though wanting the purity which, in this kind of verse, became general from the time of Catullus. About the tenth century an author, calling himself Romulus, drew up a prose version of Phaedrus, which served as a model for the mediaeval collections of fables.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φαέθων</foreign>, “the shining”). A name that occurs in Homer as an epithet or surname of Helios (the Sun), and is used by later writers as a proper name for Helios; but it is more commonly known as the name of a son of Helios by the Oceanid Clymené, the wife of Merops. The genealogy of Phaëthon, however, is not the same in all writers, for some call him a son of Clymenus, the son of Helios by Meropé, or a son of Helios by Proté, or, lastly, a son of Helios by the nymph Rhodé or Rhodos. He received the significant name of Phaëthon from his father, and was afterwards presumptuous and ambitious enough to request his father to allow him, for one day, to drive the chariot of the sun across the heavens. Helios was induced, by the entreaties of his son and of Clymené, to yield; but the youth being too weak to check the horses, they rushed out of their usual track, and came so near the earth as almost to set it on fire. Thereupon Zeus killed him with a flash of lightning, and hurled him down into the river <cb /> Eridanus. His sisters, the Heliades or Phaëthontiades, who had yoked the horses to the chariot, were metamorphosed into poplars, and their tears into amber.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φάλαγξ</foreign>). The Greek term for the order of battle in which heavy infantry were drawn up, in an unbroken line, several ranks deep. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossexercitus">Exercitus</ref>.) The most famous phalanx was that formed by King Philip, constituting the chief strength of the Macedonian army. It was first eight, afterwards twelve to sixteen deep. In the eight-rank formation, the lances (<foreign lang="greek">σάρισσαι</foreign>) being eighteen feet long, those of all ranks could be presented to the enemy. They were grasped with the right hand at the butt, and, with the left, four feet from the butt end; hence, the lances of the first rank projected fourteen feet, while the spear-heads of the last rank were level with, or just in front of, the men in the front rank. In the deeper formation, and after the reduction of the length of the sarissa to fourteen feet, only the first five ranks presented their weapons to the front; the rest held them slanting over the shoulders of their comrades in front. The name phalanx, or <foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>, 
<pb n="1223" /><cb />
 was also applied to the separate regiments of the <foreign lang="greek">φαλαγγῖται</foreign>. The line of each such phalanx was divided, from front to rear, into four chiliarchies (<foreign lang="greek">χιλιαρχίαι</foreign>), each chiliarchy into four syntagmata (<foreign lang="greek">συντάγματα</foreign>), each syntagma into four tetrarchies (<foreign lang="greek">τετραρχίαι</foreign>). The importance of this formation lay in its power of resistance to hostile onset, and in the weight with which it fell, when impelled against the enemy's lines. Its weaknesses were want of mobility, the impossibility of changing front in face of the enemy, and unsuitability for close, hand-to-hand engagement. The Roman legions also fought in phalanx in the older times before Camillus. Under the emperors the phalanx was used, after about the second century A.D., in fighting against barbaric nations.

<div2 id="crossphalaris" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Phalăris">Phalaris</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φάλαρις</foreign>). The infamous tyrant of Agrigentum, notorious for his cruelty; he was killed in a popular revolt in B.C. 549. His reign probably commenced about B.C. 570, and is said to have lasted sixteen years. He was a native of Agrigentum, and appears to have been raised by his fellow-citizens to some high office in the State, of which he afterwards availed himself to assume a despotic authority. He was engaged in frequent wars with his neighbours, and extended his power and dominion on all sides, though more frequently by stratagem than open force. He perished by a sudden outbreak of the popular fury, in which it appears that Telemachus, the ancestor of Theron, must have borne a conspicuous part. No circumstance connected with Phalaris is more celebrated than the brazen bull in which he is said to have burned alive the victims of his cruelty, and of which we are told that he made the first experiment upon its inventor, Perillus. This latter story has much the air of an invention of later times, but it is mentioned as early as Pindar (<title>Pyth.</title> i. 185).

In B.C. 411 and the following years he rendered active assistance to the Lacedaemonians in their war against the Athenians. When Dercyllidas and, subsequently, Agesilaüs passed over into Asia to protect Asiatic Greeks against the Persian power, we find Pharnabazus connecting himself with Conon to resist the Lacedaemonians. In 374 Pharnabazus invaded Egypt in conjunction with Iphicrates; but the expedition failed, chiefly through the dilatory proceedings and the excessive caution of Pharnabazus. The character of Pharnabazus is eminently distinguished by generosity and openness.

(See <ref type="cross" target="crossmithridates">Mithridates VI</ref>.) After the death of his father Pharnaces hastened to make his submission to Pompey, who granted him the kingdom of the Bosporus with the titles of friend and ally of the Roman people. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, Pharnaces seized the opportunity to reinstate himself in his father's dominions, and made himself master of the whole of Colchis and the lesser Armenia. He defeated Domitius Calvinus, the lieutenant of Caesar in Asia, but was shortly afterwards defeated by Caesar himself in a decisive action near Zela (B.C. 47). The battle was gained with such ease by Caesar that he informed the Senate of his victory by the words, <title>Veni, vedi, veci.</title> In the course of the same year Pharnaces was again defeated, and was slain by Asander, one of his generals, who hoped to obtain his master's kingdom.

He gained his first victory B.C. 438, and imitated the style of Crates, whose actor he had been. Crates and Pherecrates very much modified the coarse satire and vituperation of which this sort of poetry had previously been the vehicle, and constructed their comedies on the basis of a regular plot and with more dramatic action. Pherecrates did not, however, abstain altogether from personal satire, for we see by the fragments of his plays that he attacked Alcibiades, the tragic poet Melanthius, and others. He invented a new metre, which was named, after him, the <title>Pherecratean.</title> The system of the verse is <figure /> ¯ <figure /> ˘ ˘ <figure /> ¯, which may be best explained as a choriambus, with a spondee for its base and a long syllable for its termination.

<head orig="Phidias">Phidias</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φειδίας</foreign>). The greatest sculptor and statuary of Greece. Of his personal history we possess but few details. He was a native of Athens, was the son of Charmides, and was born about the time of the battle of Marathon, B.C. 490. He began to work as a statuary about 464, and one of his first great works was the statue of Athené Promachos, which may be assigned to about 460. This work must have established his reputation; but it was surpassed by the splendid productions of his own hand, and of others working under his direction, during the administration of Pericles. That statesman not only chose Phidias to execute the principal statues which were <cb /> to be set up, but gave him the oversight of all the works of art which were to be erected.</p>
 <p>Of these works the chief were the Propylaea (q. v.) of the Acropolis, and, above all, the temple of Athené on the Acropolis, called the Parthenon, on which, as the central point of the Athenian polity and religion, the highest efforts of the best of artists were employed. There can be no doubt that the sculptured ornaments of this temple, the remains of which form one of the glories of the British Museum (see <ref type="cross" target="crosselgin-marbles">Elgin Marbles</ref>), were executed under the immediate superintendence of Phidias; but the colossal statue of the divinity made of ivory and gold, which was enclosed within that magnificent shrine, was the work of the artist's own hand. The statue was dedicated in 438. Having finished his great work at Athens, he went to Elis and Olympia, which he was now invited to adorn. He was there engaged for about four or five years from 437 to 434 or 433, during which time he finished his statue of the Olympian Zeus, the greatest of all his works.</p>
 <p>On his return to Athens he fell a victim to the jealousy against his great patron, Pericles, which was then at its height. The party opposed to Pericles, thinking him too powerful to be overthrown by a direct attack, aimed at him in the persons of his most cherished friends—Phidias, Anaxagoras, and Aspasia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspericles">Pericles</ref>.) Phidias was first accused of peculation; but this charge was at once refuted, as, by the advice of Pericles, the gold had been affixed to the statue of Athené in such a manner that it could be removed and the weight of it examined. The accusers then charged Phidias with impiety, in having introduced into the battle of the Amazons, on the shield of the goddess, his own likeness and that of Pericles. On this latter charge Phidias was thrown into prison, where he died from disease, in 432.</p>
 <p>Of the numerous works executed by Phidias for the Athenians the most celebrated was the statue of Athené in the Parthenon, to which refer<figure id="fig.01226">

This statue was of that kind of work which the Greeks called “chryselephantine”— that is, the statue was formed of plates of ivory laid upon a core of wood or stone for the flesh parts, while the drapery and other ornaments were of solid gold. The statue stood in the foremost and larger chamber of the temple (<foreign lang="greek">πρόδρομος</foreign>). It represented the goddess standing, clothed with a tunic reaching to the ankles, with her spear in her left hand and an image of Victory four cubits high in her right: she was girded with the aegis, and had a helmet on her head, and her shield rested on the ground by her side. The height of the statue was twenty-six cubits, or nearly forty feet, including the base. The eyes were of a kind of marble, nearly resembling ivory, perhaps painted to imitate the iris and pupil; there is no sufficient authority for the statement, which is frequently made, that they were of precious stones.

<pb n="1227" /><cb /> statue, which, as above stated, was removable at pleasure, is said by Thucydides to have been forty talents, or about $470,000 (ii. 13).</p>
 <p>Still more celebrated than his statue of Athené was the colossal ivory and gold statue of Zeus, which Phidias made for the great temple of this god, in the Altis or sacred grove at Olympia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossolympia">Olympia</ref>.) This statue was regarded as the masterpiece not only of Phidias, but of the whole range of Grecian art, and was looked upon not so much as a statue, but rather as if it were the actual manifestation of the present deity. It was placed in the <foreign lang="greek">πρόδρομος</foreign>, or front chamber, of the temple directly facing the entrance. It was only visible, however, on great festivals; at other times it was concealed by a magnificent curtain. The god was represented as seated on a throne of cedarwood, adorned with gold, ivory, ebony, stones, and colours, crowned with a wreath of olive, holding in his right hand an ivory and gold statue of Victory, and in his left hand supporting a sceptre, which was ornamented with all sorts of metals, and surmounted by an eagle. The throne was brilliant both with gold and stones and with ebony and ivory, and was ornamented with figures both painted and sculptured. The statue almost reached to the roof, which was about sixty feet in height. The idea which Phidias essayed to embody in this, his greatest work, was that of the supreme deity of the Hellenic nation no longer engaged in conflicts with the Titans and the Giants, but having laid aside his thunderbolt, and enthroned as a conqueror, in perfect majesty and repose, ruling with a nod the subject world. It is related that when Phidias was asked what model he meant to follow in making his statue, he replied that of Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 528" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 528</bibl>-530). This passage has been imitated by Milton, whose paraphrase gives no small aid to the comprehension of the idea (<title>Paradise Lost</title>, iii. 135-137): <lb />“Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd <lb />All heaven, and in the blessed spirits elect <lb />Sense of new joy ineffable diffused.”</p>
 <p>The statue was removed by the emperor Theodosius I. to Constantinople, where it was destroyed by a fire in A.D. 475. In 1888 a red vase was exhumed at Tanagra, bearing a signature which archaeologists believe to be that of Phidias.</p>
 <p>The distinguishing character of the art of Phidias was ideal sublimity, especially in the representation of divinities and of subjects connected with their worship. While on the one hand he freed himself from the stiff and unnatural forms which, by a sort of religious precedent, had fettered his predecessors of the archaic or hieratic school, he never, on the other hand, descended to the exact imitation of any human model, however beautiful; he never represented that distorted action, or expressed that vehement passion, which lie beyond the limits of repose; nor did he ever approach to that almost meretricious grace, by which some of his greatest followers, if they did not corrupt the art themselves, gave the occasion for its corruption in the hands of their less gifted and spiritual imitators.

He restored the supremacy of Argos over Cleonae, Phlius, Sicyon, Epidaurus, Troezen, and Aegina, and aimed at extending his dominions over the greater part of the Peloponnesus. The Pisans invited him (B.C. 748) to aid them in excluding the Eleans from their usurped presidency at the Olympic Games, and to celebrate them jointly with themselves. The invitation quite fell in with the ambitious pretensions of Phidon, who succeeded in dispossessing the Eleans and celebrating the games along with the Pisans; but the Eleans not long after defeated him, with the aid of Sparta, and recovered their privilege. Thus apparently fell the power of Phidon; but as to the details of the struggle we have no information. The most memorable act of Phidon was his introduction of copper and silver coinage, and a new scale of weights and measures, which, through his influence, became prevalent in the Peloponnesus, and ultimately throughout the greater portion of Greece. The scale in question was known by the name of the Aeginetan, and it is usually supposed that the coinage of Phidon was struck in Aegina; but there seems good reason for believing that what Phidon did was done in Argos, and nowhere else—that “Phidonian measures” probably did not come to bear the specific name of Aeginetan until there was another scale in vogue, the Euboic, from which to distinguish them—and that both the epithets were derived, not from the place where the scale first originated, but from the people whose commercial activity tended to make them most generally known—in the one case the Aeginetans, in the other case the inhabitants of Chalcis and Eretria.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φίλαινοι</foreign>). Two Carthaginian brothers, of whom the following story is told. A contest had arisen between the Carthaginians and Cyreneans respecting the point where their respective territories met, and this was the more difficult to be determined, since the country on the borders of the two States was a sandy desert, and without anything that might serve as a common landmark. It was agreed at last that two individuals should set out at the same time from Carthage and Cyrené respectively, and that the spot where they might meet should be regarded as the common boundary of the two communities. The parties accordingly set out, the two Philaeni having been selected by the Carthaginians for this purpose; but the two Cyreneans travelled more slowly than their Carthaginian antagonists, and only met the Philaeni after the latter had advanced a considerable distance into the disputed territory. The Cyreneans thereupon accused the Philaeni of unfairness, and of having started before the appointed time. The Philaeni, on their part, offered to do anything to show that they had acted fairly, and the two Cyreneans then gave them their choice, either to be buried alive on the spot where they were standing, or else to allow them (the Cyreneans) to advance as far as they pleased into the disputed territory, and there be buried alive on their part. The Philaeni accepted the former part of the offer, and were accordingly entombed. The Carthaginians erected two altars on the spot, which were thenceforth

These altars stood in the innermost bend of the Syrtis Maior, and not, as Sallust erroneously states, to the west of both the Syrtes. The story of the Philaeni, moreover, as given by the Roman historian, seems to wear a doubtful appearance, from the circumstance of Cyrené's being so much nearer the point in question than Carthage.

He must have enjoyed remarkable popularity, for he repeatedly won victories over his younger contemporary and rival Menander, whose delicate wit was apparently less to the taste of the Athenians of the time than Philemon's more showy comedy.

Philip left a son, named Aëropus, who succeeded him.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Philippus II.</hi>, the youngest son of Amyntas II. and Eurydicé, reigned B.C. 359-336. He was born in 382, and was brought up at Thebes, whither he had been carried as a hostage by Pelopidas, and where he received a most careful education. Upon the death of his brother Perdiccas III., who was slain in battle against the Illyrians, Philip obtained the government of Macedonia, at first merely as regent and guardian to his infant nephew Amyntas; but at the end of a few months he was enabled to set aside the claims of the young prince, and to assume for himself the title of king. Macedonia was beset by dangers on every side. Its territory was ravaged by the Illyrians on the west, and the Paeonians on the north, while Pausanias and Argaeus took advantage of the crisis to put forward their pretensions to the throne. Philip was fully equal <cb /> to the emergency. By his tact and eloquence he sustained the failing spirits of the Macedonians, while at the same time he introduced among them a stricter military discipline, and organized their army on the plan of the phalanx. He first turned his army against Argaeus, the most formidable of the pretenders, since he was supported by the Athenians. He defeated Argaeus in battle, and then concluded a peace with the Athenians. He next attacked the Paeonians, whom he reduced to subjection, and immediately afterwards defeated the Illyrians in a decisive battle, and compelled them to accept a peace, by which they lost a portion of their territory. Thus in the short period of one year, and at the age of twenty-four, had Philip delivered himself from his dangerous position, and provided for the security of his kingdom. But energy and talents such as his were not satisfied with mere security, and henceforth his views were directed not to defence, but to aggrandizement. His first efforts were directed to obtain possession of the various Greek cities upon the Macedonian coast. Soon after his accession he had withdrawn his garrison from Amphipolis, and had declared it a free city, because the Athenians had supported Argaeus with the hope of recovering Amphipolis, and his continuing to hold the place would have interposed difficulties in the way of a peace with Athens, which was at that time an object of great importance to him. But he had never meant seriously to abandon this important town; and accordingly, having obtained pretexts for war with the Amphipolitans, he laid siege to the town and gained possession of it in 358. The Athenians had sent no assistance to Amphipolis, because Philip, in a secret negotiation with the Athenians, led them to believe that he was willing to restore the city to them when he had taken it, and would do so on condition of their making him master of Pydna. After the capture of Amphipo<figure id="fig.01230">
<head orig="Gold Coin of Philip the Great.">Gold Coin of Philip the Great.</head>
</figure> lis, he proceeded at once to Pydna, which seems to have yielded to him without a struggle, and the acquisition of which, by his own arms, and not through the Athenians, gave him a pretext for declining to stand by his secret engagement with them. The hostile feeling which such conduct necessarily excited against him at Athens made it most important for him to secure the good will of the powerful town of Olynthus, and to detach the Olynthians from the Athenians. Accordingly, he gave to the Olynthians the town of Potidaea, which he took from the Athenians in 356. Soon after this he attacked and took a settlement of the Thacians, called Crenides, and, having introduced into the place a number of new colonists, he named it Philippi after himself. One great advantage of this acquisition was, that it put him in possession of the gold mines of the district. From this point there is for some time a pause in the active operations of Philip. In 352 he took Methoné after a lengthened siege, in the course of which he himself 
<pb n="1231" /><cb />
 lost an eye. The capture of this place was a necessary preliminary in any movement toward the south, lying as it did between him and the Thessalian border. He now marched into Thessaly to aid the Aleuadae against Lycophron, the tyrant of Pherae. The Phocians sent a force to support Lycophron, but they were defeated by Philip, and their general Onomarchus slain. This victory gave Philip the ascendency in Thessaly. He established at Pherae what he wished the Greeks to consider a free government, and then advanced southward to Thermopylae. The pass, however, he found guarded by a strong Athenian force, and he was compelled, or at least thought it expedient, to retire. He now turned his arms against Thrace, and succeeded in establishing his ascendency in that country also. Meanwhile Philip's movements in Thessaly had opened the eyes of Demosthenes to the real danger of Athens and Greece, and his first Philippic (delivered in 352) was his earliest attempt to rouse his countrymen to energetic efforts against their enemy; but he did not produce much effect upon the Athenians. In 349 Philip commenced his attacks on the Chalcidian cities. Olynthus, in alarm, applied to Athens for aid, and Demosthenes, in his three Olynthiac orations, roused the people to efforts against the common enemy, not very vigorous at first, and fruitless in the end. In the course of three years Philip gained possession of all the Chalcidian cities, and the war was brought to a conclusion by the capture of Olynthus itself in 347. In the following year (346) he concluded peace with the Athenians, and straightway marched into Phocis, and brought the Phocian War to an end. The Phocian cities were destroyed, and their place in the Amphictyonic council was made over to the king of Macedonia, who was appointed also, jointly with the Thebans and Thessalians, to the presidency of the Pythian Games. Ruling as he did over a barbaric nation, such a recognition of his Hellenic character was of the greatest value to him, especially as he looked forward to an invasion of the Persian empire in the name of Greece, united under him in a great national confederacy. During the next few years Philip steadily pursued his ambitious projects. From 342 to 340 he was engaged in an expedition in Thrace, and attempted to bring under his power all the Greek cities in that country. In the last of these years he laid siege to Perinthus and Byzantium; but the Athenians, who had long viewed Philip's aggrandizement with fear and alarm, now resolved to send assistance to these cities. Phocion was appointed to the command of the armament destined for this service, and succeeded in compelling Philip to raise the siege of both the cities (339). Philip now proceeded to carry on war against his northern neighbours, and seemed to give himself no further concern about the affairs of Greece. But meanwhile his hirelings were treacherously promoting his designs against the liberties of Greece. In 339 the Amphictyons declared war against the Locrians of Amphissa for having taken possession of a district of the sacred land; but as the general they had appointed to the command of the Amphictyonic army was unable to effect any thing against the enemy, the Amphictyons, at their next meeting in 337, conferred upon Philip the command of their army. Philip straightway marched through Thermopylae and seized Elatea. The Athenians heard of his approach with alarm; <cb /> they succeeded, mainly through the influence of Demosthenes, in forming an alliance with the Thebans; but their united army was defeated by Philip in the month of August, 338, in the decisive battle of Chaeronea, which put an end to the independence of Greece. Thebes paid dear for her resistance, but Athens was treated with more favor than she could have expected. Philip now seemed to have within his reach the accomplishment of the great object of his ambition, the invasion and conquest of the Persian Empire. In a congress held at Corinth, which was attended by deputies from every Grecian State with the exception of Sparta, war with Persia was determined on, and the king of Macedonia was appointed to command the forces of the national confederacy. In 337, Philip's marriage with Cleopatra , the daughter of Attalus, one of his generals, led to the most serious disturbances in his family. Olympias and Alexander withdrew in great indignation from Macedonia; and though they returned home soon afterwards, they continued to be on hostile terms with Philip. Meanwhile, his preparations for his Asiatic expedition were not neglected, and early in 336 he sent forces into Asia, under Parmenion, to draw over the Greek cities to his cause. But in the summer of this year he was murdered at a grand festival which he held at Aegae, to solemnize the nuptials of his daughter with Alexander of Epirus. His murderer was a youth of noble blood, named Pausanias, who stabbed him as he was walking in the procession. The assassin was immediately pursued and slain by some of the royal guards. His motive for the deed is stated by Aristotle to have been private resentment against Philip, to whom he had complained in vain of a gross outrage offered to him by Attalus. Olympias and Alexander, however, were suspected of being implicated in the plot. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossolympias">Olympias</ref>.) Philip died in the forty-seventh year of his age and the twenty-fourth of his reign, and was succeeded by Alexander the Great. Philip had a great number of wives and concubines. Besides Olympias and Cleopatra , we may mention— (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) His first wife Audata, an Illyrian princess, and the mother of Cynané; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Phila, sister of Derdas and Machatas, a princess of Elymiotis; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Nicesipolis of Pherae, the mother of Thessalonica; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Philinna of Larissa, the mother of Arrhidaeus; (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) Meda, daughter of Cithelas, king of Thrace; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Arsinoë, the mother of Ptolemy I., king of Egypt, with whom she was pregnant when she married Lagus. To these numerous connections temperament as well as policy seems to have inclined him. He was strongly addicted, indeed, to sensual enjoyment of every kind; but his passions, however strong, were always kept in subjection to his interests and ambitious views. He was fond of science and literature, in the patronage of which he appears to have been liberal; and his appreciation of great minds is shown by his connection with Aristotle. In the pursuit of his political objects he was, as we have seen, unscrupulous, and ever ready to resort to duplicity and corruption; but when we consider his humanity and generous clemency, we may admit that he does not appear to disadvantage, even morally speaking, by the side of his fellow conquerors of mankind. See Curteis, <bibl default="NO"><title>Rise of the Macedonian Empire</title> (New York, 1878)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(3) The name of Philip was bestowed by the Macedonian army upon Arrhidaeus, the bastard son of Philip II., when he was raised to the throne 
<pb n="1232" /><cb />
 after the death of Alexander the Great. He accordingly appears in the list of Macedonian kings as Philip III. For his life and reign see <ref type="cross" target="crossarrhidaeus">Arrhidaeus</ref>.</p>
 <p>(4) Eldest son of Cassander, whom he succeeded on the throne, B.C. 296. He reigned only a few months, and was carried off by a consumptive disorder.</p>
 <p>(5) Son of Demetrius II., reigned B.C. 220-178. He was only eight years old at the death of his father Demetrius (229); and the sovereign power was consequently assumed by his uncle Antigonus Doson, who, though he certainly ruled as king rather than merely as guardian of his nephew, was faithful to the interests of Philip, to whom he transferred the sovereignty at his death in 220, to the exclusion of his own children. Philip was only seventeen years old at the time of his accession, but he soon showed that he possessed ability and wisdom superior to his years. In consequence of the defeat of the Achaeans and Aratus by the Aetolians, the former applied for aid to Philip. This was granted; and for the next three years Philip conducted with distinguished success the war against the Aetolians. This war, usually called the Social War, was brought to a conclusion in 217, and at once gained for Philip a distinguished reputation throughout Greece, while his clemency and moderation secured him an equal measure of popularity. But a change came over his character soon after the close of the Social War. He became suspicious and cruel; and having become jealous <figure id="fig.01232">
<head orig="Coin of Philip V.">Coin of Philip V.</head>
</figure> of his former friend and counsellor Aratus, he caused him to be removed by a slow and secret poison in 213. Meantime he had become engaged in war with the Romans. In 215 he concluded an alliance with Hannibal; but he did not prosecute the war with any activity against the Romans, who on their part were too much engaged with their formidable adversary in Italy to send any powerful armament against the Macedonian king. In 211 the war assumed a new character in consequence of the alliance entered into by the Romans with the Aetolians. It was now carried on with greater vigour and alternate success; but as Philip gained several advantages over the Aetolians, the latter people made peace with Philip in 205. In the course of the same year the Romans likewise concluded a peace with Philip, as they were desirous to give their undivided attention to the war in Africa. It is probable that both parties looked upon this peace as little more than a suspension of hostilities. Such was clearly the view with which the Romans had accepted it; and Philip not only proceeded to carry out his views for his own aggrandizement in Greece, without any regard to the Roman alliances in that country, but he even sent a body of auxiliaries to the Carthaginians in Africa, who fought at Zama under Hannibal. As soon as the Romans had brought the Second Punic War to an end, they again declared war against Philip, in 200. This war lasted between <cb /> three and four years, and was brought to an end by the defeat of Philip by the consul Flamininus at the battle of Cynoscephalae in the autumn of 197. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossflamininus">Flamininus</ref>.) By the peace finally granted to Philip (196), the king was compelled to abandon all his conquests, both in Europe and Asia, surrender his whole fleet to the Romans, and limit his standing army to 5000 men, besides paying a sum of 1000 talents. Philip was now effectually humbled, and endeavoured to cultivate the friendship of the all-powerful Republic. But towards the end of his reign he determined to try once more the fortune of war, and began to make active preparations for this purpose. His declining years were embittered by disputes between his sons Perseus and Demetrius; and the former, by forged letters, persuaded the king that Demetrius was plotting against his life, and induced him to order his execution. Philip afterwards learned of the trick that had been played upon him and was struck with such remorse as probably led to his death, which took place in B.C. 179 (Livy , xl. 6<bibl n="Liv.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 21</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  54" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 54</bibl>; Polyb. xxiv. 7, 8).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. Roman Citizens</hi>. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Marcius Philippus</hi>, praetor B.C. 188, with Sicily as his province, and consul 186, when he carried on war in Liguria with his colleague Sp. Postumius Albinus. He was defeated by the enemy in the country of the Apuani, and the recollection of his defeat was preserved by the name of the Saltus Marcius. In 169 Philippus was consul a second time, and carried on the war in Macedonia against Perseus, but accomplished nothing of importance. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossperseus">Perseus</ref>.) In 164 Philippus was censor with L. Aemilius Paulus, and in his censorship he set up in the city a new sun-dial. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshorologium">Horologium</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Marcius Philippus</hi> was a tribune of the plebs 104, when he brought forward an agrarian law, and was consul in 91 with Sex. Iulius Caesar. In this year Philippus, who belonged to the popular party, opposed with the greatest vigour the measures of the tribune Drusus, who at first enjoyed the full confidence of the Senate. But his opposition was all in vain; the laws of the tribune were carried. Soon afterwards Drusus began to be regarded with mistrust and suspicion; Philippus became reconciled to the Senate, and on his proposition a senatus consultum was passed, declaring all the laws of Drusus to be null and void, as having been carried against the auspices. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdrusus">Drusus</ref>.) In the Civil Wars between Marius and Sulla , Philippus took no part. He survived the death of Sulla ; and he is mentioned afterwards as one of those who advocated sending Pompey to conduct the war in Spain against Sertorius. Philippus was one of the most distinguished orators of his time ( <title>Epist.</title> i. 7, 46). As an orator he was reckoned inferior only to Crassus and Antonius. He was a man of luxurious habits, which his wealth enabled him to gratify: his fish-ponds were particularly celebrated for their magnificence and extent, and are mentioned by the ancients along with those of Lucullus and Hortensius. Besides his son, L. Philippus, who is spoken of below, he had a step-son, Gellius Publicola. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspublicola">Publicola</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Marcius Philippus</hi>, son of the preceding, was consul in 56. Upon the death of C. Octavius, the father of Augustus, Philippus married his widow Atia, and thus became the step-father of Augustus. Philippus was a timid man. Notwithstanding his close connection with Caesar's family, he remained neutral 
<pb n="1233" /><cb /> in the Civil Wars; and after the assassination of Caesar, he endeavoured to dissuade his step-son, the young Octavianus, from accepting the inheritance which the dictator had left him. He lived till his step-son had acquired the supremacy of the Roman world. He restored the temple of Hercules and the Muses, and surrounded it with a colonnade, which is frequently mentioned under the name of Porticus Philippi (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, vi. 801).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">IV. Roman Emperors</hi>. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Iulius Philippus I.</hi>, Roman emperor A.D. 244-249, was an Arabian by birth, and entered the Roman army, in which he rose to high rank. He accompanied Gordianus III. in his expedition against the Persians; and upon the death of the excellent Misitheus (see <hi rend="SmallCaps">Misitheus</hi>), he was promoted to the vacant office of praetorian praefect. He availed himself of the influence of his high office to excite discontent among the soldiers, who at length assassinated Gordian, and proclaimed Philippus emperor, 244. Philippus proclaimed his son Caesar, concluded a disgraceful peace with Sapor, founded the city of Philippopolis, and then returned to Rome. In 245 he was engaged in prosecuting a successful war against the Carpi on the Danube. In 248, rebellions, headed by Iotapinus and Marinus, broke out simultaneously in the East and in Moesia. Both pretenders speedily perished, but Decius, having been dispatched to recall the legions on the Danube to their duty, was himself forcibly invested with the purple by the troops, and compelled by them to march upon Italy. Philippus, having gone forth to encounter his rival, was slain near Verona either in battle or by his own soldiers. The great domestic event of the reign of Philippus was the exhibition of the Secular Games, which were celebrated with even more than the ordinary degree of splendour, since Rome had now, according to the received tradition, attained the thousandth year of her existence (A.D. 248).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Iulius Philippus II.</hi>, son of the foregoing, was a boy of seven at the accession (244) of his father, by whom he was proclaimed Caesar, and three years afterwards (247) received the title of Augustus. In 249 he was slain, according to Zosimus, at the battle of Verona, or murdered, according to Victor, at Rome by the Praetorians, when intelligence arrived of the defeat and death of the emperor.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">V. Writers</hi>. (1) Of Medma, in the south of Italy, a Greek astronomer, and a disciple of Plato. His observations, which were made in the Peloponnesus and in Locris, were used by the astronomers Hipparchus, Geminus the Rhodian, and Ptolemy.</p>
 <p>(2) Of Thessalonica, an epigrammatic poet, who, besides composing a large number of epigrams himself, compiled one of the ancient Greek Anthologies. The whole number of epigrams ascribed to him in the Greek Anthology is nearly ninety; but of these, six (xxxvi.-xli.) ought to be ascribed to Lucillius, and a few others are manifestly borrowed from earlier poets, while others are mere imitations. He probably wrote in the reign of Trajan.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φίλιστος</foreign>). A Greek historian of Syracuse, born about B.C. 435. He encouraged the elder Dionysius, by advice and assistance, in securing and maintaining the position of despot in his native State; but was himself banished by Dionysius in 386, and lived a long while at Adria in Epirus, busied with historical studies. Recalled by Dionysius the younger, he counteracted the salutary influence of Dion and Plato at that tyrant's court, and brought about the banishment of both. As commander of the fleet against Dion and the revolted Syracusans, he lost a naval battle, and in consequence either committed suicide or was cruelly murdered by the angry populace (356). He left an historical work, begun in his exile, called <title>Sicelica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σικελικά</foreign>), a history of Sicily in thirteen books. Books i.-vii. dealt with the events of the earliest times to the capture of Agrigentum by the Carthaginians in 406; viii.-xi., with the rule of the elder Dionysius; xii. and xiii., with that of the younger. The last portion, which remained incomplete owing to his death, was finished by his countryman Athanas. Only unimportant fragments of this have survived. According to the judgment of the ancients, he imitated Thucydides somewhat unsuccessfully, and betrayed in his work the one-sided attitude natural to his political views ( <title>Dion</title>, 36; <title>Ad Cn. Pompeium</title>, 5). The fragments of Philistus are edited by C. Müller in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> (Paris, 1841)</bibl>.

 <p>(2) An Athenian architect who built for Demetrius Phalereus, about B.C. 318, the portico to the great temple at Eleusis. It had twelve Doric columns in front, and its dimensions were 183 feet by 37 1/2 feet. Under the administration of Lycurgus, he constructed an <seg lang="la">armamentarium</seg> or arsenal at Zea in the Piraeus, containing tackle, etc., for 1000 ships (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 125" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 125</bibl>).

Edited by Köchly and Rüstow <bibl default="NO">(1853)</bibl>. See <ref type="cross" target="crossseven-wonders-of-the-world">Seven Wonders of the World</ref>.</p>
 <p>(4) Of Larissa; an Academic philosopher, a pupil of Clitomachus. He came to Rome in B.C. 88, being one of a number of eminent Greeks who fled 
<pb n="1234" /><cb />
 from Athens on the approach of its siege during the Mithridatic War. He was a man of versatile genius, and a perfect master of the theory and practice of oratory. Cicero had scarcely heard him before all inclination for Epicureanism was swept from his mind, and he surrendered himself wholly to the brilliant Academic (<title>Brutus</title>. 306). One of his works, twice mentioned, though not by any definite title (<title>Acad.</title> i. 13, ii. 11), supplied Cicero with his historic account of the New Academy (<title>Academica</title>, ed. Reid, pp. 2, 52).</p>
 <p>(5) Called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iudaeus</hi>, “the Jew.” Born of a priestly family at Alexandria, about B.C. 25, he carefully studied the different branches of Greek culture, and, in particular, acquired a knowledge of the Platonic philosophy, while in no way abandoning the study of the Scriptures or the creed of his nation. In A.D. 39 he went to Rome as an emissary to the emperor Caligula in the interest of his fellow-countrymen, whose religious feelings were offended by a decree ordering them to place the statue of the deified emperor in their synagogues. This embassy, which led to no result, is described by him in a work which is still extant, though in an incomplete form. Philo is the chief representative of the Graeco-Judaic philosophy. He wrote numerous Greek works in a style modelled on that of Plato. These are remarkable for moral earnestness, passionate enthusiasm, and vigour of thought. They include allegorical expositions of portions of the Scriptures, as well as works of ethical, historical, or political purport. Several of his works only survive in Armenian versions. His philosophy, especially his theology, is an endeavour to reconcile Platonism with Judaism. Eng. trans. by Yonge, 4 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1854-55)</bibl>.</p>

A considerable fragment of his translation of the alleged Phoenician writer <ref type="cross" target="crosssanchuniathon">Sanchuniathon</ref> (q.v.) is preserved in the first book of the <title>Praeparatio Evangelica</title> of Eusebius ; and he also wrote a work <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Πόλεων</foreign>, much used by the later grammarians, especially Hesychius and Stephanus of Byzantium.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Publilius</hi>. A distinguished Roman general in the Samnite Wars, and the author of one of the great reforms in the Roman constitution. He was consul in B.C. 339, with Ti. Aemilius Mamercinus, and defeated the Latins, over whom he triumphed. In the same year he was appointed dictator by his colleague Aemilius Mamercinus, and, as such, proposed the celebrated <title>Publiliae Leges</title>, which abolished the power of the patrician assembly of the curiae, and elevated the plebeians to an equality with the patricians for all practical purposes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspubliliae-leges">Publiliae Leges</ref>.) In 337 Philo was the first plebeian praetor, and in 332 he was censor with Sp. Postumius Albinus. In 327 he was consul a second time, and carried on war in the south of Italy. He was continued in the command for the following year with the title of proconsul, the first instance in Roman history in which a person was invested with proconsular power. He took Palaepolis in 326. In 320 he was consul a third time, with L. Papirius Cursor, and carried on the war with success against the Samnites (<bibl n="Liv.  8. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, viii. 15</bibl>-26; ix. 7-15).</p>

He accompanied Scipio to Africa, and after the battle of Zama (B.C. 202) was sent to Rome to announce the news of Hannibal's defeat (<bibl n="Liv.  28. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxviii. 9</bibl>-11; xxx. 38-40).

Here in his sickness he dragged out a miserable life till the tenth year of the war. Then, however, on account of Helenus's prophecy that Troy could only be conquered by the arrows of Heracles, Odysseus and Diomedes went to fetch him, and he was healed by Machaon. After he had slain Paris, Troy was conquered. He was one of the heroes who came safe home again. The story of Philoctetes was dramatized by Aeschylus and Euripides (B.C. 431), as well as by Sophocles (409), the last being still extant (ed. by Graves [Boston and N. Y. 1894]). It is also the theme of numerous monuments of ancient art. See Prof. Jebb's introduction to Soph. <title>Phil.</title>, p. xxxvii.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φιλόλαος</foreign>). A distinguished Pythagorean philosopher. He was a native of Croton or Tarentum, a contemporary of Socrates, and the instructor of Simmias and Cebes at Thebes, where he appears to have lived many years. Pythagoras and his earliest successors did not commit any of their doctrines to writing, and the first publication of the Pythagorean doctrines is pretty uniformly attributed to Philolaüs. He composed a work on the Pythagorean philosophy in three books, which Plato is said to have procured at the cost of 100 minae through Dion of Syracuse, who purchased it from Philolaüs, who was at the time in deep poverty ( <bibl n="Gel.  3. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 17</bibl>).

<head orig="Philologia">Philologia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φιλολογία</foreign>). The terms “philology” and “philological” are so convenient as frequently to be used in various senses in modern times; and this diversity of application is found also in the corresponding words among the ancients. Plato is the first Greek writer to employ the terms <foreign lang="greek">φιλολογία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">φιλόλογος</foreign>. In the <title>Theaetetus</title> (146 A) <foreign lang="greek">φιλολογία</foreign> denotes a fondness for argument; in the  <title>Laws</title>(641 E) <foreign lang="greek">φιλόλογος</foreign> means one who is given to talking as opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">βραχύλογος</foreign> Spartan. He develops the meaning a little further in the <title>Laches</title> (188 C), where it is applied to a person fond of philosophical discussion as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">μισόλογος</foreign>. In Aristotle <foreign lang="greek">φιλολογία</foreign> means a love of learning, and Cicero quotes the word in the same sense in a letter to Atticus (ii. 17). In a passage of Pericles, cited by Stobaeus (428, 53), it is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἀπαίδευτος</foreign>, and in Plutarch (<title>Lucull.</title> 42) it is contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">πολιτικός</foreign>. In the Alexandrian period (280 + B.C.) it is often restricted to the sense of a “scholar” and “a learned man,” and was so applied to Eratosthenes, who was not, first of all, a student of language or literature, but a mathematician and astronomer. In Plutarch it is oftenest, however, used of a linguist ( <bibl n="Plut.  2. 645" default="NO">Plut.ii. 645</bibl>C). See Gudeman, <title>Outlines of the Hist. of Class. Philology</title>, pp. 1-5 <bibl default="NO">(2d ed. Boston, 1894)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>At Rome the prevailing sense was that of “a scholar,” and it was so applied to Aelius Stilo, the teacher of Varro ( <title>De Grammat.</title> p. 108 Reiff.). This comprehensive sense is also seen in a remarkable passage of Seneca (<title>Epist.</title> 108, 29), in which he distinguishes the respective standpoints of the philologist, the grammarian, and the philosopher. Hence we find that the word philology has, at different times, been understood to mean “a love of speaking,” “the study of language,” and finally “learning” in a wider sense of the word.</p>
 <p>Language-study among the Greeks originated as an adjunct to psychological research. In an attempt to answer the question as to the nature of thought and the expression of thought, an endeavour was made to discover just what the nature of language is in its relation to the thought <cb /> which it expresses; and this led to an investigation of the original meaning of words. Languagestudy, therefore, did not begin as a distinct science, but only as an adjunct to another branch of learning, and therefore it took the form of etymology. The Greeks never thought of connecting their own language with that of any other people, though Plato once came near to such an idea in a passage of his <title>Cratylus</title> (410), where he notes the similarity between the Greek and Phrygian names for certain common objects.</p>
 <p>Such etymologizing as was done by the Greeks and Romans was largely in the nature of guesswork; but in the dialogue of Plato just mentioned some suggestions of considerable acuteness are put forth. In fact, this treatise embodies all that was best and truest in ancient linguistic speculation, and to it not much was added by writers on language down to the beginning of the present century. Plato is the first to draw attention to the distinction between simple and compound words; and his classification of the letters of the alphabet is the first that we find in any of the ancient writings. He separates them into “voiced” letters (<foreign lang="greek">φωνήεντα</foreign>) or vowels and “voiceless” letters or consonants (<foreign lang="greek">ἄφωνα</foreign>); the latter he subdivides into semi-vowels (<foreign lang="greek">ἡμίφωνα</foreign>—i. e. <foreign lang="greek">λ, μ, ν, ρ, ς</foreign>) and true mutes (<foreign lang="greek">ἄφθογγα</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The discussion as to the original meaning of words in course of time led to a consideration of the origin of human speech, as to which two schools arose. One set of scholars (the Anomalists) held that language arose by mere convention (<foreign lang="greek">θέσει</foreign>), that words were arbitrarily assigned to objects, and that there was no inherent appropriateness in giving any particular object its name. The other set of thinkers (the Analogists), who were of the Eleatic School of philosophers, held that words are essentially and necessarily expressive of the objects which they describe, that they are made by nature (<foreign lang="greek">φύσει</foreign>), that thought was stamped on words in their genesis, and that words have the same relation to things as exists between sensation and that which causes the sensation. Heraclitus illustrated his meaning by saying that the names of objects are, as it were, their shadows, representing them just as images in water represent the objects which they reflect. The theory of language which was put forth to explain this inherent appropriateness was the so-called mimetic or onomatopoetic theory (see <ref type="cross" target="crossonomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</ref>), which is found expressed in a passage of Epicurus, cited by Diogenes Laertius (ix. 75) and by Lucretius <bibl n="Lucr. 5.1028" default="NO" valid="yes">(v. 1028)</bibl>. The mimetic theory they did not push very far, but merely asserted that there is something in the sound of primitive words appropriate to the sense. This Plato illustrates in his <title>Cratylus</title> by saying that, in order to arrive at the earliest meaning of a word, the word must be resolved not merely into its simplest form, but into the very letters which compose it; for these, or rather the sounds which they denote, possess a meaning. This fact, he says, was well known to the first makers of language, who observed that the sound of <foreign lang="greek">α</foreign> denotes vastness and the sound of <foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> denotes length; that <foreign lang="greek">ρ</foreign> expresses motion, as in <foreign lang="greek">ῥέω, τρόμος, ῥυμβέω</foreign>, because, in uttering this letter, the tongue is most agitated and least at rest; that <foreign lang="greek">φ, ψ, ς</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign> require a great expenditure of breath, and are therefore used in the expression of such notions as are contained in <foreign lang="greek">ζέω, σεισμός</foreign>, etc., 
<pb n="1236" /><cb />
 and, in general, wherever the thought of air is involved; that the limpid movement of <foreign lang="greek">λ</foreign>, in whose pronunciation the tongue slips easily along, enables that letter to express smoothness, as in <foreign lang="greek">λεῖος, λίπαρον</foreign>: that the sound of <foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> detains the slipping tongue, so that when it is prefixed to <foreign lang="greek">λ</foreign> there is given an impression of what is glutinous and clammy, as in <foreign lang="greek">γλισχρός, γλυκύς, γλοιώδης</foreign>: that <foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign>, being sounded within, gives the notion of inwardness, while <foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign> suggests roundness. Thus, Plato says, the first language-makers impressed thought on names by giving them an imitative quality. Gesture is the method which a deafand-dumb person would use to make his meaning plain; and language is only vocal gesture— the gesture of the tougue. Yet, he adds, though thought was stamped on words in their genesis, the original meaning has in most cases been lost; so that the use of a word may now be metaphorical, accidental, or conventional, and thus may have no real relation to the thought or feeling of the speaker who uses it. Language has, therefore, both a natural element and a conventional element. In another portion of the <title>Cratylus</title> Plato ridicules many of the popular etymologies, such as <foreign lang="greek">αἰθήρ</foreign> as a contraction of <foreign lang="greek">ἀειθεήρ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>+<foreign lang="greek">θέειν</foreign>), “always running”; <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">ἐχονόη</foreign>, “possession of mind,” on which Socrates says ironically that “you have only to take away the <foreign lang="greek">τ</foreign>, insert <foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign> between the <foreign lang="greek">χ</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign>, and another <foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign> between the <foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">π</foreign>,” and thus you have <foreign lang="greek">ἐχονόη</foreign>! (See Jowett's introduction to his translation of the <title>Cratylus.</title>) </p>
 <p>The Sophists were much given to etymologizing, and made a great use of the so-called principle of Antiphrasis, which in later times was taken up by the Romans, and prevailed also to some extent in the Middle Ages. Antiphrasis explains names as being suggested by what is opposed to them in meaning, as when <seg lang="la">aridus</seg> (“dry”) is derived from <foreign lang="greek">ἀρδεύειν</foreign>: <seg lang="la">bellum</seg> from <seg lang="la">bellus</seg> (“fine”), because it is not a fine thing; <seg lang="la">caelum</seg> from <seg lang="la">celare</seg> (“to conceal”), because it conceals nothing; and the very famous etymology, which has in modern times become proverbial, <seg lang="la">lucus a non lucendo.</seg> The philosophical principle on which this notion was based is of course a sound one—i. e. that of two antithetical ideas one is apt to suggest the other, as light suggests darkness, as truth suggests falsehood, etc.; but the application of it to etymology was absurd. It appears to have been suggested to the ancients by the existence of certain well-known euphemisms, such as that which calls the Furies <title>Eumenides</title> or “the well-wishers,” the left hand “the wellnamed,” and so forth. They also observed in irony a similar principle; and, therefore, putting the two together, inferred that there is something in the human mind that instinctively describes objects by recalling their opposites. Among the writers who treated of etymological subjects at this period were Gorgias (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὀνομάτων</foreign>), Protagoras (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὀρθοεπείας</foreign>), Prodicus (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὀνομάτων</foreign>), and Licymnius (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Λέξεων</foreign>), the last of whom, in the course of his teaching, noted and partly classified synonyms, root-words, compounds, and cognates.</p>
 <p>In the Alexandrian Period language was studied on its strictly grammatical side, and formal grammar arose at Alexandria in the writings of men like Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Tryphon, and at Pergamum with Crates of Mallos, <cb /> who introduced philological study to the Romans, though formal grammar was first carefully studied at Rome after the time of Dionysius Thrax. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgrammatica">Grammatica</ref>.) At the same time lexicography was developed in the form of special glossaries, on which see <ref type="cross" target="crosslexicon">Lexicon</ref>.</p>
 <p>During the later Middle Ages speculation as to the origin and nature of language was a favourite amusement of scholars; but no advance was made by them in linguistics, owing to the fact that Greek and Latin were both supposed to be derived from the Hebrew. Upon the proof of this thesis an enormous amount of labour was wasted by generations of scholars, of whom Guichard and Gebelin may be taken as types. It was not until 1786, when Sir William Jones initiated the study of Sanskrit, that philology began to be set upon a scientific basis by a recognition of the fact that Sanskrit, Avestan, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Keltic belong to the same family of languages; and soon after Franz <ref type="cross" target="crossbopp">Bopp</ref> (q.v.) became the founder of the special science of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Comparative Philology</hi>, which deals with the study of each language in its relation to the other members of the same family. His monumental treatise on Comparative Grammardealt with the phonetic laws of the several languages, and traced their general forms back to a common origin in an Indo-European or “Aryan” speech now lost. Bopp's work was carried on and developed by such men as Jakob Grimm, who first scientifically studied the Teutonic languages; by Pott and by Benfey, the accomplished Sanskritist. The new science was applied to Greek by Georg Curtius, and to Latin by the German, Wilhelm <ref type="cross" target="crosscorssen">Corssen</ref> (q.v.), and the Frenchman, Michel Bréal.</p>
 <p>It now began to be accepted as a truth that the change which is always going on in languages is regulated by law; that in each form of speech there is a regular sequence of sound, which is not due to chance or to the conscious desire of those who speak it, but which has a definite, ascertainable course; and that the science of language is a science because the knowledge of these sequences can be acquired and understood. The most famous laws of sound-change are those known as Grimm's Law and Verner's Law. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgrimms-law">Grimm's Law</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossverners-law">Verner's Law</ref>.</p>
 <p>Until comparatively recent years students of language held that the operation of phonetic law did not always exclude the possibility of what they called “sporadic change”—that is to say, changes that are found in some words, though not in every word in which the sound so affected occurs. To this notion of sporadic change the so-called New School of philologists vigorously objects. Brugmann, Paul, Osthoff, Ascoli, Leskien, and Verner (to mention only a few distinguished names) hold that phonetic change, so far as it is due to physical causes, is absolutely uniform in any one language at the same time; that the new form, when produced by such a change, invariably drives out the old one; and that in consequence there is no such thing as “sporadic change”; for phonetic law is as exact and definite as the law of any physical science. The “New School” of philologists has devoted itself very largely to an investigation of language on its inner or psychical side, and has therefore brought psychology into a close relation with the study of language. In so doing they have recognized the immense importance 
<pb n="1237" /><cb /> of the principle of analogy, which tends to reduce words of like function to a certain likeness of form, and thus conditions every new word that is made by the forms of like words that already exist. According to the New School, therefore, the two chief factors in word-formation are Phonetic Change due to the desire for euphony, and which is largely destructive, doing away with sounds or combinations which are inconvenient to pronounce; the other principle is Analogy, which comes from the imitative habit of the mind, and is rather restorative than destructive, constantly producing new forms on the analogy of old ones to supply each want that arises in the course of man's intellectual development.</p>
 <p>At the present time the term “Linguistics” (Ger. <title>Linguistik</title>) is supplanting the word Philology in the sense of language-study pure and simple; while Philology, or rather <ref type="cross" target="crossclassical-philology">Classical Philology</ref>, is coming to be used as a comprehensive name for the general study of ancient life in all its various political, social, and intellectual phases, as handed down in the literary, epigraphic, and monumental remains of Greece and Rome. It embraces, then, not only Grammar, Lexicography, Text Criticism, and Hermeneutics, but Epigraphy, Numismatics, and Art; or as Karl Otfried Müller said: “Philology does not strive to establish isolated facts or to get an acquaintance with abstract forms, but to grasp the ancient spirit in its broadest meaning, in its works of reason, of feeling, and of imagination.”</p>

It is generally stated that Philonides was an actor of Aristophanes, who is said to have committed to him and to Callistratus his chief characters; but the best modern critics have shown that this is an erroneous statement, and that the true state of the case is that several of the plays of Aristophanes were brought out in the names of Callistratus and Philonides. We learn from Aristophanes himself not only the fact that he brought out his early plays in the names of other poets, but also his reasons for so doing. In the parabasis of the <title>Knights</title> (v. 514), he states that he had pursued this course not from want of thought, but from a sense of the difficulty of his profession, and from a fear that he might suffer from that fickleness of taste which the Athenians had shown towards other poets, as Magnes, Crates, and Cratinus.

<head orig="Philopoemen">Philopoemen</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φιλοποίμην</foreign>). A native of Megalopolis in Arcadia, one of the few great men that Greece produced in the decline of her political independence. The great object of his life was to infuse among the Achaeans a military spirit, and thereby to establish their independence on a firm and lasting basis. He was the son of Craugis, a distinguished man at Megalopolis, and was born about B.C. 252. He lost his father at an early age, and was brought up by Cleander, an illustrious citizen of Mantinea, who had been obliged to leave his native city, and had taken refuge at Megalopolis. He received instruction from Ecdemus and Demophanes, both of whom had studied the Academic philosophy under Arcesilaüs. At an early 
<pb n="1238" /><cb />
 age he became distinguished by his love of arms and his bravery in war. His name, however, first occurs in history in B.C. 222, when Megalopolis was taken by Cleomenes, and in the following year (221) he fought with conspicuous valour at the battle of Sellasia, in which Cleomenes was completely defeated. In order to gain additional military experience, he soon afterwards sailed to Crete, and served for some years in the wars between the cities of that island. On his return to his native country, in 210, he was appointed commander of the Achaean cavalry; and in 208 he was elected <seg lang="la">strategus</seg>, or general of the Achaean League. In this year he defeated Machanidas, tyrant of Lacedaemon, and slew him in battle with his own hand. In 201 he was again elected general of the league, when he defeated Nabis, who had succeeded Machanidas as tyrant of Lacedaemon. Soon afterwards Philopoemen took another voyage to Crete, and assumed the command of the forces of Gortyna. He did not return to Peloponnesus till 194. He was made general of the League in 192, when he again defeated Nabis, who was slain in the course of the year by some Aetolian mercenaries. Philopoemen was reëlected general of the League several times afterwards; but the state of Greece did not afford him much further opportunity for the display of his military abilities. The Romans were now in fact the masters of Greece, and Philopoemen clearly saw that it would be an act of madness to offer open resistance to their authority. At the same time as the Romans still recognized in words the independence of the League, Philopoemen offered a resolute resistance to all their encroachments upon the liberties of his country, whenever he could do so without affording them any pretext for war. In 188, when he was general of the League, he took Sparta, and treated it with the greatest severity. He razed the walls and fortifications of the city, abolished the institutions of Lycurgus, and compelled the citizens to adopt the Achaean laws in their stead. In 183 the Messenians revolted from the Achaean League. Philopoemen, who was general of the League for the eighth time, hastily collected a body of cavalry, and pressed forward to Messené. He fell in with a large body of Messenian troops, by whom he was taken prisoner and carried to Messené. Here he was thrown into a dungeon, and was compelled by Dinocrates to drink poison. The news of his death filled the whole of Peloponnesus with grief and rage. An assembly was immediately held at Megalopolis; Lycortas was chosen general; and in the following year he invaded Messenia, which was laid waste far and wide; Dinocrates and the chiefs of his party were obliged to put an end to their lives. The remains of Philopoemen were conveyed to Megalopolis in solemn procession; and the urn which contained the ashes was carried by the historian Polybius. His remains were then interred at Megalopolis with heroic honours, and soon afterwards statues of him were erected in most of the towns belonging to the Achaean League. The life of Philopoemen is narrated by Plutarch. See also Pausan. viii. 49-52.

<head orig="Philosophia">Philosophia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φιλοσοφία</foreign>). <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek Philosophy</hi>.—The beginnings of philosophy in Greece came from the Ionians of Asia; and it is in agreement with the character of that people, naturally inclined to the physical or sensualist view, that what the Ionian philosophers sought was the material <cb /> principle (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>) of things, and the mode of their origin and disappearance. Thales of Miletus (about B.C. 640) is reputed the father of Greek philosophy. He declared water to be the basis of all things. Next came Anaximander of Miletus (about B.C. 611-547), the first writer on philosophy. He assumed as the first principle an undefined substance (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἄπειρον</foreign>) without qualities, out of which the primary antitheses, hot and cold, moist and dry, became differentiated. His countryman and younger contemporary, Anaximenes, took for his principle air, conceiving it as modified, by thickening and thinning, into fire, wind, clouds, water, and earth. Heraclitus of Ephesus (about B.C. 535-475) assumed as the principle of substance aetherial fire. From fire all things originate, and return to it again by a never-resting process of development. All things, therefore, are in a perpetual flux (<foreign lang="greek">πάντα ῥεῖ</foreign>).</p>
 <p>Philosophy was first brought into connection with practical life by Pythagoras of Samos (about 582-504), from whom it received its name (“the love of wisdom”). Regarding the world as a perfect harmony, dependent on number, he aimed at inducing mankind likewise to lead a harmonious life. His doctrine was adopted and extended by a large following, especially in Lower Italy.</p>
 <p>That country was also the home of the Eleatic doctrine of the One, called after the town of Elea, the headquarters of the school. It was founded by Xenophanes of Colophon (born about 570), the father of pantheism, who declared God to be the eternal unity, permeating the universe, and governing it by his thought. His great disciple, Parmenides of Elea (born about 511), affirmed the one unchanging existence to be alone true and capable of being conceived, and multitude and change to be an appearance without reality. This doctrine was maintained dialectically by his younger countryman Zeno in a polemic against the vulgar opinion, which sees in things multitude, becoming, and change. Empedocles of Agrigentum (born 492) appears to have been partly in agreement with the Eleatic School, partly in opposition to it: on the one hand, maintaining the unchangeable nature of substance; while, on the other, he supposes a plurality of such substances—i. e. the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire. Of these the world is built up, by the agency of two ideal principles as motive forces—viz., love as the cause of union, hate as the cause of separation.</p>
 <p>Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (born about B.C. 500) also maintained the existence of an ordering principle as well as a material substance, and while regarding the latter as an infinite multitude of imperishable primary elements, qualitatively distinguished, conceived divine reason as ordering them. He referred all generation and disappearance to mixture and resolution respectively. To him belongs the credit of first establishing philosophy at Athens, in which city it reached its highest development, and continued to have its home for one thousand years without intermission. The first explicitly materialistic system was formed by Democritus of Abdera (born about B.C. 460). This was the doctrine of atoms—small primary bodies infinite in number, indivisible and imperishable, qualitatively similar, but distinguished by their shapes. Falling eternally through the infinite void, they collide and unite, thus generating existence, and forming objects which differ in accordance with the varieties, in number, size, shape, and arrangement, of the atoms which compose them.

 <p>The efforts of all these earlier philosophers had been directed somewhat exclusively to the investigation of the ultimate basis and essential nature of the external world. Hence their conceptions of human knowledge, arising out of their theories as to the constitution of things, had been no less various. The Eleatics, for example, had been compelled to deny the existence of any objective truth, since to the world of sense, with its multitude and change, they allowed only a phenomenal existence. This inconsistency led to the position taken up by the class of persons known as Sophists (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssophistae">Sophistae</ref>), that all thought rests solely on the apprehensions of the senses and on subjective impression, and that therefore we have no other standard of action than utility for the individual.</p>
 <p>A new period of philosophy opens with the Athenian Socrates (469-399). Like the Sophists, he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the subjective thoughts and opinions of men his starting-point; but whereas it was the thoughts and opinions of the individual that the Sophists took for the standard, Socrates endeavoured to extract from the common intelligence of mankind an objective rule of practical life. For this purpose he employed the two forms of philosophical inquiry of which he is the inventor, induction and definition. Such a standard he saw in knowledge, by which term he understood the cognition in thought of the true concept of an object, and identified it with virtue; that is to say, such action as proceeds from clear cognition of the concept appropriate to the circumstances. Thus, although Socrates did not himself succeed in establishing a genuine ethical principle, he is nevertheless the founder of ethics, as he is also of dialectic, the method of the highest speculative thought. Of Socrates' numerous disciples many either added nothing to his doctrine, or developed it in a one-sided manner, by confining themselves exclusively either to dialectic or to ethics. Thus while the Athenian Xenophon contented himself, in a series of writings, with exhibiting the portrait of his master to the best of his comprehension, and added nothing original, the Megarian School, founded by Euclides of Megara, devoted themselves almost entirely to dialectic investigation; whereas ethics preponderated both with the Cynics and Cyrenaics, although the position taken up by these two schools was in direct antithesis. For Antisthenes of Athens, the founder of the Cynics, conceived the highest good to be the virtue which spurns every enjoyment; while Aristippus of Cyrené, the founder of the Cyrenaics, considered pleasure to be the solo end in life, and regarded virtue as a good only in so far as it contributed to pleasure. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyrenaici">Cyrenaïci</ref>.</p>
 <p>Both aspects of the genius of Socrates were first united in Plato of Athens (428-348), who also combined with them all the principles established by earlier philosophers, in so far as they had been legitimate, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system. The groundwork of Plato's scheme, though nowhere expressly stated by him, is the threefold division of philosophy into dialectic, ethics, and physics; its central point is the theory of ideas. This theory is a combination of the Eleatic doctrine of the One with Heraclitus's theory of a perpetual flux <cb /> and with the Socratic method of concepts. The multitude of objects of sense, being involved in perpetual change, are thereby deprived of all genuine existence. The only true being in them is founded upon the ideas, the eternal, unchangeable (independent of all that is accidental, and therefore perfect) types, of which the particular objects of sense are imperfect copies. The number of the ideas is defined by the number of universal concepts which can be derived from the particular objects of sense. The highest idea is that of the Good, which is the ultimate basis of the rest, and the first cause of being and knowledge. Apprehensions derived from the impressions of sense can never give us the knowledge of true being—i. e. of the ideas. It can only be obtained by the soul's activity within itself, apart from the troubles and disturbances of sense; that is to say, by the exercise of reason. Dialectic, as the instrument in this process, leading us to knowledge of the ideas, and finally of the highest idea of the Good, is the first of sciences (<seg lang="la">scientia scientiarum</seg>). In physics, Plato adhered (though not without original modifications) to the views of the Pythagoreans, making Nature a harmonic unity in multiplicity. His ethics are founded throughout on the Socratic; with him, too, virtue is knowledge, the cognition of the supreme idea of the Good. And since in this cognition the three parts of the soul, cognitive, spirited, and appetitive, all have their share, we get the three virtues, Wisdom, Courage, and Temperance or Continence. The bond which unites the other virtues is the virtue of Justice, by which each several part of the soul is confined to the performance of its proper function. The school founded by Plato, called “the Academy,” from the name of the grove of the Attic hero Academus, where he used to deliver his lectures, continued for long after. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacademia">Academia</ref>.) In regard to the main tendencies of its members, it was divided into the three periods of the Old, Middle, and New Academy. The chief personages in the first of these were Speusippus (son of Plato's sister), who succeeded him as the head of the school (till 339), and Xenocrates of Chalcedon (till 314). Both of them sought to fuse Pythagorean speculations on number with Plato's theory of ideas. The two other Academies were still further removed from the specific doctrines of Plato. See <ref type="cross" target="crossplato">Plato</ref>.</p>
 <p>The most important among Plato's disciples is Aristotle of Stagira (384-322), who shares with his master the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But whereas Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the suprasensual standpoint of the ideas, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Philosophy to him meant science, and its aim was the recognition of the “wherefore” in all things. Hence he endeavours to attain to the ultimate grounds of things by induction—that is to say, by <seg lang="la">a posteriori</seg> conclusions from a number of facts to a universal. In the series of works collected under the name of <title>Organon</title>, Aristotle sets forth, almost in a final form, the laws by which the human understanding effects conclusions from the particular to the knowledge of the universal. Like Plato, he recognizes the true being of things in their concepts, but denies any separate existence of the concept apart from the particular objects of sense. They are inseparable as matter 
<pb n="1240" /><cb />
 and form. In this antithesis, matter and form, Aristotle sees the fundamental principles of being. Matter is the basis of all that exists; it comprises the potentiality of everything, but of itself is not actually anything. A determinate thing only comes into being when the potentiality in matter is converted into actuality. This is effected by form, the idea existent not as one outside the many, but as one in the many, the completion of the potentiality latent in the matter. Although it has no existence apart from the particulars, yet, in rank and estimation, form stands first; it is of its own nature the most knowable, the only true object of knowledge. For matter without any form cannot exist, but the essential definitions of a common form, in which are included the particular objects, may be separated from matter. Form and matter are relative terms, and the lower form constitutes the matter of a higher (e. g. body, soul, reason). This series culminates in pure, immaterial form, the Deity, the origin of all motion, and therefore of the generation of actual form out of potential matter. All motion takes place in space and time; for space is the potentiality, time the measure of the motion. Living beings are those which have in them a moving principle, or soul. In plants the function of soul is nutrition (including reproduction); in animals, nutrition and sensation; in men, nutrition, sensation, and intellectual activity. The perfect form of the human soul is reason separated from all connection with the body, hence fulfilling its activity without the help of any corporeal organ, and so imperishable. By reason the apprehensions, which are formed in the soul by external sense-impressions, and may be true or false, are converted into knowledge. For reason alone can attain to truth either in cognition or action. Impulse towards the good is a part of human nature, and on this is founded virtue; for Aristotle does not, with Plato, regard virtue as knowledge pure and simple, but as founded on nature, habit, and reason. Of the particular virtnes (of which there are as many as there are contingencies in life), each is the apprehension, by means of reason, of the proper mean between two extremes which are not virtues—e. g. courage is the mean between cowardice and foolhardiness. The end of human activity, or the highest good, is happiness, or perfect and reasonable activity in a perfect life. To this, however, external goods are more or less necessary conditions. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaristoteles">Aristoteles</ref>.</p>
 <p>The followers of Aristotle, known as Peripatetics (Theophrastus of Lesbos, Eudemus of Rhodes, Strato of Lampsacus, etc.), to a great extent abandoned metaphysical speculation, some in favour of natural science, others of a more popular treatment of ethics, introducing many changes into the Aristotelian doctrine in a naturalistic direction. A return to the views of the founder first appears among the later Peripatetics, who did good service as expositors of Aristotle's works. The tendency of the Peripatetic School, to make philosophy the exclusive property of the learned class, thereby depriving it of its power to benefit a wider circle, soon produced a reaction; and philosophers returned to the practical standpoint of Socratic ethics. The speculations of the learned were only admitted in philosophy where immediately serviceable for ethics. The chief consideration <cb /> was how to popularize doctrines, and to provide the individual, in a time of general confusion and dissolution, with a fixed moral basis for practical life.</p>
 <p>Such were the aims of Stoicism, founded at Athens about 310 by Zeno of Cittium, and brought to fuller systematic form by his successors as heads of the school, Cleanthes of Assos, and especially Chrysippus of Soli, who died about 206. Their doctrines contained little that was new, seeking rather to give a practical application to the dogmas which they took ready-made from previous systems. With them philosophy is the science of the principles on which the moral life ought to be founded. The only allowable endeavour is towards the attainment of knowledge of things human and divine, in order to regulate life thereby. The method to lead men to true knowledge is provided by logic; physics embraces the doctrines as to the nature and organization of the universe; while ethics draws from them its conclusions for practical life. All knowledge originates in the real impressions of things on the senses, which the soul, being at birth a <seg lang="la">tabula rasa</seg>, receives in the form of presentations. These presentations, when confirmed by repeated experience, are syllogistically developed by the understanding into concepts. The test of their truth is the convincing or persuasive force with which they impress themselves upon the soul. In physics the foundation of the Stoic doctrine was the dogma that all true being is corporeal. Within the corporeal they recognized two principles, matter and force—i. e. the material, and the Deity permeating and informing it. Ultimately, however, the two are identical. There is nothing in the world with any independent existence: all is bound together by an unalterable chain of causation. The concord of human action with the law of nature, of the human will with the divine will, or life according to nature, is Virtue, the chief good and highest end in life. It is essentially one, the particular or cardinal virtues of Plato being only different aspects of it; it is completely sufficient for happiness, and incapable of any differences of degree. All good actions are absolutely equal in merit, and so are all bad actions. All that lies between virtue and vice is neither good nor bad; at most, it is distinguished as preferable, undesirable, or absolutely indifferent. Virtue is fully possessed only by the wise man, who is no way inferior in worth to Zeus; he is lord over his own life, and may end it by his own free choice. In general, the prominent characteristic of Stoic philosophy is moral heroism, often verging on asceticism. See <ref type="cross" target="crosszeno">Zeno</ref>.</p>
 <p>The same goal which was aimed at in Stoicism was also approached, from a diametrically opposite position, in the system founded about the same time by Epicurus, of the deme Gargettus in Attica (342-268), who brought it to completion himself. Epicureanism, like Stoicism, is connected with previous systems. Like Stoicism, it is also practical in its ends, proposing to find in reason and knowledge the secret of a happy life, and admitting abstruse learning only where it serves the ends of practical wisdom. Hence, logic (called by Epicurus <foreign lang="greek">κανονικόν</foreign>, or the doctrine of canons of truth) is made entirely subservient to physics, physics to ethics. The standards of knowledge and canons of truth in theoretical 
<pb n="1241" /><cb />
 matters are the impressions of the senses, which are true and indisputable, together with the presentations formed from such impressions, and opinions extending beyond those impressions, in so far as they are supported or not contradicted by the evidence of the senses. In practical questions the feelings of pleasure and pain are the tests. Epicurus's physics, in which he follows in essentials the materialistic system of Democritus, are intended to refer all phenomena to a natural cause, in order that a knowledge of nature may set men free from the bondage of disquieting superstitions. In ethics he followed within certain limits the Cyrenaic doctrine, conceiving the highest good to be happiness, and happiness to be found in pleasure, to which the natural impulses of every being are directed. But the aim is not with him, as it is with the Cyrenaics, the pleasure of the moment, but the enduring condition of pleasure, which, in its essence, is freedom from the greatest of evils, pain. Pleasures and pains are, however, distinguished not merely in degree, but in kind. The renunciation of a pleasure or endurance of a pain is often a means to a greater pleasure; and since pleasures of sense are subordinate to the pleasures of the soul, the undisturbed peace of the soul is a higher good than the freedom of the body from pain. Virtue is desirable not for itself, but for the sake of pleasure of soul, which it secures by freeing men from trouble and fear and moderating their passions and appetites. The cardinal virtue is wisdom, which is shown by true insight in calculating the consequences of our actions as regards pleasure or pain. See <ref type="cross" target="crossepicurus">Epicurus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The practical tendency of Stoicism and Epicureanism, seen in the search for happiness, is also apparent in the Sceptical School founded by Pyrrho of Elis (about 365-275). Pyrrho disputes the possibility of attaining truth by sensuous apprehension, reason, or the two combined, and thence infers the necessity of total suspension of judgment on things. Thus can we attain release from all bondage to theories, a condition which is followed, like a shadow, by that imperturbable state of mind which is the foundation of true happiness. Pyrrho's doctrine was followed by the Middle and New Academies (see above), represented by Arcesilaüs of Pitané (316-241) and Carneades of Cyrene (214-129) respectively, in their attacks on the Stoics, for asserting a criterion of truth in our knowledge, although they considered that what they were maintaining was a genuine tenet of Socrates and Plato. The latest Academics, such as Antiochus of Ascalon (about B.C. 80), fused with Platonism certain Peripatetic and many Stoic dogmas, thus making way for Eclecticism, to which all later antiquity tended after Greek philosophy had spread itself over the Roman world. After the Christian era Pythagoreanism, in a resuscitated form, again takes its place among the more important systems; but the preëminence belongs to Platonism, which is notably represented in the works of Plutarch of Chaeronea and the physician Galen, while Scepticism is maintained by another physician, Sextus Empiricus.</p>
 <p>The closing period of Greek philosophy is marked in the third century A.D. by the establishment in Rome, under Plotinus of Lycopolis in Egypt (205-270), of Neoplatonism, a scientific philosophy of religion, <cb /> in which the doctrine of Plato is fused with the most important elements in the Aristotelian and Stoic systems and with Oriental speculations. At the summit of existences stands the One or the Good, as the source of all things. It generates from itself, as if from the reflection of its own being, reason, wherein is contained the infinite store of ideas. Soul, the copy of the reason, is generated by and contained in it, as reason is in the One, and, by informing matter in itself non-existent, constitutes bodies whose existence is contained in soul. Nature, therefore, is a whole, endowed with life and soul. Soul, being chained to matter, longs to escape from the bondage of the body and return to its original source. In virtue and philosophic thought it has the power to elevate itself above the reason into a state of ecstasy, where it can behold, or ascend up to, that one good primary Being whom reason cannot know. To attain this union with the Good, or God, is the true function of man, to whom the external world should be absolutely indifferent. Plotinus's most important disciple, the Syrian Porphyrius, contented himself with popularizing his master's doctrine. But the school of Iamblichus, a disciple of Porphyrius, effected a change in the position of Neoplatonism, which now took up the cause of polytheism against Christianity, and adopted for this purpose every conceivable form of superstition, especially those of the East. Foiled in the attempt to resuscitate the old beliefs, its supporters then turned with fresh ardour to scientific work, and especially to the study of Plato and Aristotle, in the interpretation of whose works they rendered great services. The last home of philosophy was at Athens, where Proclus (411- 485) sought to reduce to a kind of system the whole mass of philosophic tradition, till in A.D. 529 the teaching of philosophy at Athens was forbidden by Justinian.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman Philosophy</hi> is throughout founded on the Greek. Interest in the subject was first excited at Rome in B.C. 155 by an Athenian embassy, consisting of the Academic Carneades, the Stoic Diogenes, and the Peripatetic Critolaüs. Of more permanent influence was the work of the Stoic Panaetius, the friend of the younger Scipio and of Laelius; but a thorough study of Greek philosophy was first introduced in the time of Cicero and Varro. In a number of works they endeavoured to make it accessible even to those of their countrymen who were outside the learned circles. Cicero chiefly took it up in a spirit of Eclecticism; but among his contemporaries Epicureanism is represented in the poetical treatise of Lucretius (q. v.) on the nature of things, and Pythagoreanism by Nigidius Figulus. In imperial times Epicureanism and Stoicism were most popular, especially the latter, as represented by the writings of Seneca, Cornutus, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius; while Eclectic Platonism was taken up by Apuleius of Madaura. One of the latest philosophical writers of antiquity is Boëthius, whose writings were the chief source of information as to Greek philosophy during the first centuries of the Middle Ages.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φιλώτας</foreign>). A son of Parmenio. He distinguished himself on many occasions as a commander of cavalry under Alexander the Great, but was at last accused of conspiring against the king's life. An informer said that he had at first told his secret to Philotas, who had daily access to Alexander, but who had taken no notice of it for two days, at the end of which time, through the means of another officer near Alexander's person, the information was conveyed to the king. This threw strong suspicion on Philotas, who, however, was not implicated by either the informer or any of the accused in their confessions. But Craterus, who was jealous of Philotas, on account of the favour which the latter enjoyed with the king, encouraged the suspicions of Alexander, who recollected what Philotas had said at the time when the former claimed Zeus Ammon for his father, that he pitied those who were doomed to serve a man that fancied himself to be a god. Craterus had also, for some time previous, bribed a courtesan intimate with Philotas, who reported to him, and, through him, to the king, all the expressions of discontent uttered by Philotas in his unguarded moments. In short, Alexander was induced to order Philotas to be tortured in consequence of the suggestions of Craterus, Hephaestion, and others of the king's companions. The torture was administered by Craterus himself, and Philotas, after enduring dreadful agonies, confessed, though in vague terms, that he had conspired against the life of Alexander, and that his father Parmenio was cognizant of it. This being considered sufficient evidence, Philotas was stoned to death; and Parmenio suffered not long after him. See <ref type="cross" target="crossparmenion">Parmenio</ref>.

<div2 id="crossphineus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Phineus">Phineus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φινεύς</foreign>). (1) Son of Belus and Anchinoë, and brother of Cepheus. He was slain by Perseus. For details see <ref type="cross" target="crossandromeda">Andromeda</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossperseus">Perseus</ref>.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of Agenor, and king of Salmydessus in Thrace. He was first married to Cleopatra , the daughter of Boreas and Orithyia, by whom he had two children, Oryithus (Oarthus) and Crambis; but their names are different in the different legends: Ovid calls them Polydectus and Polydorus. Afterwards he was married to Idaea (some call her Dia, Eurytia, or Idothea), by whom he again had two sons, Thynus and Mariandynus.</p>
 <p>Phineus was a blind soothsayer, who had received his prophetic powers from Apollo; but the cause of his blindness is not the same in all accounts. He is most celebrated on account of his being tormented by the Harpies, who were sent by the gods to punish him on account of his cruelty towards his sons by the first marriage. His second wife falsely accused them of having made an attempt upon her virtue, whereupon Phineus put out their eyes, or, according to others, exposed them to be devoured by wild beasts, or ordered them to be half buried in the earth, and then to be scourged. Therefore the gods struck him with blindness and sent the Harpies to torment him. Whenever a <cb /> meal was placed before Phineus, the Harpies darted down from the air and carried it off; later writers add that they either devoured the food themselves or rendered it unfit to be eaten. When the Argonauts visited Thrace, Phineus promised to instruct them respecting their voyage, if they would deliver him from the monsters. This was done by Zetes and Calaïs, the sons of Boreas, and brothers of Cleopatra (<bibl n="A. R.  2. 284" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollon. ii. 284</bibl>). Phineus now explained to the Argonauts the further course they had to take, and especially cautioned them against the Symplegades. According to another story the Argonauts, on their arrival at Thrace, found the sons of Phineus half buried, and demanded their liberation, which Phineus refused. A battle thereupon ensued, in which Phineus was slain by Heracles. The latter also delivered Cleopatra from her confinement, and restored the kingdom to the sons of Phineus; and on their advice he also sent the second wife of Phineus back to her father, who ordered her to be put to death. Some traditions, lastly, state that Phineus was killed by Boreas, or that he was carried off by the Harpies into the country of the Bistones or Milchessians. Those accounts in which Phineus is stated to have put out the eyes of his sons add that they had their sight restored to them by the sons of Boreas, or by Asclepius.

The name Phocaean is often used with reference to Massilia. It was said to have been founded by Phocian colonists under Philogenes and Damon. It was originally within the limits of Aeolis, in the territory of Cyme; but the Cymaeans voluntarily gave up the site for the new city, which was soon admitted into the Ionian Confederacy on the condition of adopting oecists of the race of Codrus. It was admirably situated, and possessed two excellent harbours, Naustathmus and Lampter. After the Persian conquest of Ionia, Phocaea had so declined that she could only furnish three ships to support the great Ionian revolt; but the spirit of her people had not been extinguished; when the common cause was hopeless, and their city was besieged by Harpalus, they embarked, to seek new abodes in the distant West, and bent their course to their colony of Aetalia in Corsica. During the voyage, however, a portion of the emigrants resolved to return to their native city, which they restored, and which recovered much of its prosperity, as is proved by the rich booty gained by the Romans, when they plundered it under the praetor Aemilius, after which it does not appear as a place of any consequence in history.</p>

<div2 id="crossphocion" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Phocion">Phocion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φωκίων</foreign>). An Athenian general and statesman, son of Phocus. He was a man of humble origin, <cb /> and appears to have been born in B.C. 402. He studied under Plato and Xenocrates. He distinguished himself for the first time under his friend Chabrias, in 376, at the battle of Naxos; but he was not employed prominently in any capacity for many years afterward. In 354 (according to others in 350) he was sent into Euboea in the command of a small force in consequence of an application from Plutarchus, tyrant of Eretria; and he was subsequently employed on several occasions in the war between the Athenians and Philip of Macedon. He frequently opposed the measures of Demosthenes, and recommended peace with Philip; but he must not be regarded as one of the mercenary supporters of the Macedonian monarch. His virtue is above suspicion, and his public conduct was always influenced by upright motives. When Alexander was marching upon Thebes in 335, Phocion rebuked Demosthenes for his invectives against the king; and after the destruction of Thebes he advised the Athenians to comply with Alexander's demand for the surrender of Demosthenes and other chief orators of the antiMacedonian party. This proposal was indignantly rejected by the people, and an embassy was sent to Alexander, which succeeded in deprecating his resentment. According to Plutarch, there were two embassies, the first of which Alexander refused to receive, but to the second he gave a gracious audience and granted its prayer, chiefly from regard to Phocion, who was at the head of it. Alexander ever continued to treat Phocion with the utmost consideration, and to cultivate his friendship. He also pressed upon him valuable presents; but Phocion persisted in refusing his presents, begging the king to leave him no less honest than he found him, and only so far availed himself of the royal favour as to request the liberty of certain prisoners at Sardis, which was immediately granted to him. After Alexander's death Phocion opposed vehemently, and with all the caustic bitterness which characterized him, the proposal for war with Antipater. Thus, to Hyperides, who asked him tauntingly when he would advise the Athenians to go to war, he answered, “When I see the young willing to keep their ranks, the rich to contribute of their wealth, and the orators to abstain from pilfering the public money.” When the Piraeus was seized by Alexander, the son of Polysperchon, in 318, Phocion was suspected of having advised Alexander to take this step; whereupon, being accused of treason by Agnonides, he fled, with several of his friends, to Alexander, who sent them with letters of recommendation to his father Polysperchon. The latter, willing to sacrifice them as a peace-offering to the Athenians, sent them back to Athens for the people to deal with them as they would. Here Phocion was sentenced to death. To the last he maintained his calm and dignified and somewhat contemptuous bearing. When some wretched man spat upon him as he passed to the prison, “Will no one,” said he, “check this fellow's indecency?” To one who asked him whether he had any message to leave for his son Phocus, he answered, “Only that he bear no grudge against the Athenians.” And when the hemlock which had been prepared was found insufficient for all the condemned, and the jailer would not furnish more until he was paid for it, “Give the man his money,” said Phocion to one of his friends, “since at Athens one 
<pb n="1245" /><cb /> cannot even die for nothing.” He perished in the year 317, at the age of eighty-five.</p>
 <p>The Athenians are said to have repented of their conduct. A brazen statue was raised to the memory of Phocion, and Agnonides was condemned to death. Phocion was twice married, and his second wife appears to have been as simple and frugal in her habits as himself; but he was less fortunate in his son Phocus, who, in spite of his father's lessons and example, was a thorough profligate. As for Phocion himself, commendation of him must be almost wholly confined to his private qualities. His fellow-citizens may have been degenerate, but he made no effort to elevate them. His life is written by Plutarch. See also Morell, <bibl default="NO"><title>Vita Phocionis</title> (Leyden, 1869)</bibl>; and Thirlwall, vii. pp. 256 foll.

<div2 id="crossphocis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Phocis">Phocis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φωκίς</foreign>). A country in northern Greece, bounded on the north by the Locri Epicnemidii and Opuntii, on the east by Boeotia, on the west by the Locri Ozolae and Doris, and on the south by the Corinthian Gulf. At one time it possessed a narrow strip of country on the Euboean Sea, with the seaport Daphnus, between the territory of the Locri Epicnemidii and Locri Opuntii. It was a mountainous and unproductive country, and owes its chief importance in history to the fact of its possessing the Delphic oracle. Its chief mountain was Parnassus, situated in the interior of the country, to which, however, Cnemis, on its northern frontier, Cirphis, south of Delphi, and Helicon, on the southeastern frontier, all belonged. The principal river in Phocis was the Cephisus, the valley of which contained almost the only fertile land in the country, with the exception of the celebrated Crissaean Plain in the southwest, on the borders of the Locri Ozolae. Among the earliest inhabitants of Phocis we find mentioned Leleges, Thracians, Abantes, and Hyantes. Subsequently, but still in the ante-historical period, the Phlegyae, an Achaean race, a branch of the Minyae at Orchomenos, took possession of the country; and from this time the main bulk of the population continued to be Achaean, although there were Dorian settlements at Delphi and Bulis. The Phocians are said to have derived their name from an eponymous ancestor <ref type="cross" target="crossphocus">Phocus</ref> (q.v.), and they are mentioned under this name in the <title>Iliad.</title></p>
 <p>The Phocians played no conspicuous part in Greek history till the time of Philip of Macedon; but at this period they became involved in a war, called the Phocian or Sacred War, in which the principal states of Greece took part. The Thebans had long been inveterate enemies of the Phocians; and as the latter people had cultivated a portion of the Crissaean Plain, which the Amphictyons had declared in B.C. 585 should lie waste forever, the Thebans availed themselves of this pretext to persuade the Amphictyons to impose a fine upon the Phocians, and upon their refusal to pay it, the Thebans further induced the council to declare the Phocian land forfeited to the god of Delphi. Thus threatened by the Amphictyonic Council, backed by the whole power of Thebes, the Phocians were persuaded by Philomelus, one of their citizens, to seize Delphi, and to make use of the treasures of the temple for the purpose of carrying on the war. They obtained possession of the temple in B.C. 357. The war which ensued lasted ten years, and was carried on with various success on each side. The Phocians were commanded first by Philomelus, <cb /> B.C. 357-353, afterward by his brother Onomarchus, 353-352, then by Phaÿllus, the brother of the two preceding, 352-351, and finally by Phalaecus, the son of Onomarchus, 351-346. The Phocians received some support from Athens, but their chief dependence was upon their mercenary troops, which the treasures of the Delphic temple enabled them to hire. The Amphictyons and the Thebans, finding at length that they were unable with their own resources to subdue the Phocians, called in the assistance of Philip of Macedon, who brought the war to a close in 346. The conquerors inflicted the most signal punishment upon the Phocians, who were regarded as guilty of sacrilege. All their towns were razed to the ground with the exception of Abae, and the inhabitants distributed in villages containing no more than fifty inhabitants. The two votes which they had in the Amphictyonic Council were taken away and given to Philip. See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilippus">Philippus</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φοινίκη</foreign>); <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phoenicia</hi> is found in only one passage ( <title>De Fin.</title> iv. 20). Phoenicia; an Asiatic country on the Syrian coast. It was bounded on the north by the river Eleutherus, on the south by Mount Carmel, and on the east by Palestine and Coelesyria. It largely consisted of fertile, well-watered valleys, its chief rivers being the Eleutherus, the Sabbaticus, the Tripolis, the Adonis, the Lycus , the Magoras, the Tamyras, the Leo, the Lita, the Belus, and the Kishon. Its principal cities were Sidon, Tripolis, Byblus, Tyrus, Berytus, and Ptolemaïs. Phoenicia being little more than a narrow strip of coast, was almost necessarily a maritime country, and its cities for many centuries were at the head of naval power in ancient times. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssidon">Sidon</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstyrus">Tyrus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Their commerce extended over the known world, and they became everywhere known for their traffic and dyestuffs, especially the Tyrian purple, glass, tin, and amber. They also, in connection with their commerce, established many colonies within the Mediterranean on various islands (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscyprus">Cyprus</ref>), on the north coast of Africa (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscarthago">Carthago</ref>), and even on the western coasts of Spain and Africa. They also had settlements on the Euxine Sea. In Gaul the city of Massilia was founded by the Phoenicians.</p>
 <p>In race the Phoenicians must be classed as Semitic, as is evident from the language which they spoke and of which our knowledge is derived 
<pb n="1246" /><cb />
 from a large number of inscriptions, mostly mortuary and votive, found in Phoenicia itself and more numerously on the site of Carthage and Citium. A number of Phoenician phrases are found transliterated in the comedy of Plautus mentioned below. The native Phoenician literature seems not to have been extensive, and of it nothing has been preserved except some fragments such as the Greek translation of Sanchuniathon and Hanno. The inscriptions, such as they are, cover, roughly speaking, a period extending from B.C. 600 to A.D. 250. Like the other Semitic languages the Phoenician is written without the vowel points. Some scholars have regarded the language as being so closely allied to Hebrew as to be almost capable of classification as a Hebrew dialect. Phoenician is more archaic in its structure, simpler in its syntax, and with an apparently limited vocabulary, but this last is perhaps an unsafe generalization owing to the fact that so little material has survived from which to judge of it. The Phoenician script is the prototype of the Greek and Roman alphabets as well as of the principal Semitic scripts. The oldest specimen of it is the Moabite Stone (q v.). The origin of the Phoenician itself is doubtful. Some scholars, like De Rouge, consider it a derivative from the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The language spoken in Carthage was practically the same as the original Phoenician, with differences in the pronunciation and orthography, and to some extent in the script. A curious bit of Phoenician exists in the <title>Poenulus</title> of Plautus, where one of the speakers utters some sentences in Carthaginian. The interpretation of the passage has puzzled scholars for generations. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspoenulus">Poenulus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The influence of the Phoenicians upon Greek art has some importance, as from them the Greeks borrowed the types for all their early gold and silver work and for their vase patterns. The Greek religion was also influenced by them, on which see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossaphrodite">Aphrodité</ref>.</p>
 <p>The internal history of Phoenicia is not very well known, nor is its form of government thoroughly understood. Particularism seems to have been its character, and the different cities of Phoenicia were practically independent of one another. Hence, at different periods, they fell an easy prey to invaders from Egypt, Assyria, Macedon, and Rome. At the earliest period of which we have any knowledge Phoenicia is found a dependency of Egypt, ruled by Egyptian governors and paying an annual tribute. About B.C. 1300 Egypt lost this hold owing to internal disturbances, which compelled her to give up her foreign possessions, and for several centuries after this the importance of the Phoenicians attains its height. About B.C. 800 the Assyrians obtained at least a nominal control and exacted tribute from the Phoenician cities, though without interfering with their commercial importance.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φοίνιξ</foreign>). A fabulous bird, of which Herodotus gives the following account in that part of his work which treats of Egypt (ii. 73): “The phoenix is another sacred bird, which I have never seen except in effigy. He rarely appears in Egypt; once only in five hundred years, immediately after the death of his father, as the Heliopolitans affirm. If the painters describe him truly, his feathers represent a mixture of crimson and gold, and he resembles the eagle in outline and size. They affirm that he does the following thing, which to me is not credible. They say that he comes from Arabia, and, bringing the body of his father inclosed in myrrh, buries him in the temple of the Sun; and that he brings him in the following manner: First, he moulds as great a quantity of myrrh into the shape of an egg as he is well able to carry; and, after having tried the weight, he hollows out the egg, and puts his parent into it, and stops up with some more myrrh the hole through which he had introduced the body, so that the weight is the same as before: he then carries the whole mass to the temple of the Sun in Egypt. Such is the account they give of the phoenix.” Similar stories of marvellous birds are found in Persian literature (of the bird Simorg) and in Sanskrit literature (of the bird Semendar).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φοίνιξ</foreign>). Son of Amyntor, king of Argos, and the preceptor of Achilles, to whom he was so attached that he accompanied him to the Trojan War. According to the Homeric account ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 447" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ix. 447</bibl> foll.), Amyntor, having transferred his affections from his lawful wife, Hippodamia, to a concubine, the former besought her son Phoenix to gain the affections of his father's mistress, and alienate her from Amyntor. Phoenix succeeded in his suit, and his enraged father imprecated upon him the bitterest curses. The son, therefore, notwithstanding the entreaties and efforts of his relations to detain him at his parent's court, fled to Phthia, in Thessaly, where he was kindly received by Peleus, monarch of the country, who assigned him a territory on the confines of Phthia and the sway over the Dolopians. He intrusted him also with the education of his son Achilles. 
<pb n="1247" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Later writers, however, make Amyntor to have put out his son's eyes, and the latter to have fled in this condition to Peleus, who led him to Chiron, and persuaded the Centaur to restore him to sight. There was a play entitled <title>Phoenix</title> by Sophocles, another by Euripides, and a third by Ion.</p>
 <p>After the death of Achilles, Phoenix, who had gone with him to the Trojan War, was one of those commissioned to return to Greece and bring young Pyrrhus to the war. On the fall of Troy he returned with that prince to Thessaly, in which country he continued to reside until his death.

The fragrance of the wine spread over the mountain, and soon brought all the Centaurs, armed with stones and pine sticks, to the cave of Pholus. The first who ventured to enter were driven back by Heracles with burning brands: he hunted the remainder with his arrows to Malea. When Heracles returned to Pholoë from this pursuit, he found Pholus lying dead along with several others; for, having drawn the arrow out of the body of one of them, while he was wondering how so small a thing could destroy such large beings, it dropped out of his hand and stuck in his foot, and he died immediately ( <bibl n="Apollod.  2.5.4" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.ii.5.4</bibl> foll.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φόνος</foreign>). The Greek term for manslaughter, homicide. Originally in Greek the right of private vengeance was recognized, and only a ceremonious purification was required of those who thus took life ( <title>De Caede Herod.</title> 11). This primitive custom was disused at Athens as early as the time of the Draconian legislature, and survived in only a few special instances, as where the husband might kill the adulterer whom he caught in the act (see <ref type="cross" target="crossadulterium">Adulterium</ref>); personal chastity might also be defended by bloodshed. From this time, kinsmen of a deceased person, instead of becoming the lawful slayers of his murderer, were rather the legitimate prosecutors before the courts. In Attic law <foreign lang="greek">φόνος ἑκούσιος</foreign> is the term for murder, and <foreign lang="greek">φόνος ἀκούσιος</foreign> for manslaughter. All suits involving questions of homicide (<foreign lang="greek">φονικαὶ δίκαι</foreign>) were under the jurisdiction of the Archon Basileus, assisted by the Ephetae. They were tried in the Court of the Areopagus, or in any of the four courts over which the Ephetae presided. The proceedings took place in the open air, lest the judges should be under the same roof with one accused of impiety. The Archon Basileus presided, and the trial occupied two days.

<div2 id="crossphrygia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Phrygia">Phrygia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φρυγία</foreign>). A country of Asia Minor, which was of different extent at different periods. Under the Roman Empire Phrygia was bounded on the west by Mysia, Lydia, and Caria; on the south by Lycia and Pisidia; on the east by Lycaonia (which is often reckoned as a part of Phrygia) and Galatia (which formerly belonged to Phrygia), and on the north by Bithynia. The Phrygians are mentioned by Homer as settled on the banks of the Sangarius, where later writers tell us of the powerful Phrygian kingdom of Gordius and Midas. 
<pb n="1249" /><cb /> It would seem that they were a branch of the great Thracian family, originally settled in the northwest of Asia Minor as far as the shores of the Hellespont and Propontis, and that the successive migrations of other Thracian peoples, as the Thyni, Bithyni, Mysians, and Teucrians, drove them farther inland. They were not, however, entirely displaced by the Mysians and Teucrians from the country between the shores of the Hellespont and Propontis and Mounts Ida and Olympus, where they continued side by side with the Greek colonies, and where their name was preserved in that of the district under all subsequent changes—namely, Phrygia Minor or Phrygia Hellespontus. The kingdom of Phrygia was conquered by Croesus, and formed part of the Persian, Macedonian, and Syro-Grecian Empires; but, under the last, the northeastern part, adjacent to Paphlagonia and the Halys, was conquered by the Gauls, and formed the western part of Galatia; and under the Romans was included in the province of Asia. In connection with the early intellectual culture of Greece, Phrygia is highly important. The earliest Greek music, especially that of the flute, was borrowed in part, through the Asiatic colonies, from Phrygia. With this country also were closely associated the orgies of Dionysus and of Cybelé, the Mother of the Gods, the <title>Phrygia Mater</title> of the Roman poets. After the Persian conquest, however, the Phrygians seem to have lost all intellectual activity, and they became proverbial among the Greeks and Romans for submissiveness and stupidity. The Roman poets constantly use the epithet Phrygian as equivalent to Trojan.</p>
 <p>But scanty remains of the Phrygian language survive, chiefly in the shape of brief inscriptions. It was probably an Indo-European dialect closely related to the Armenian, and some such relation is implied in the notices of Herodotus (vii. 73) and Strabo (p. 295).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Φρύνιχος</foreign>). (1) A Greek tragic poet of Athens, an older contemporary of Aeschylus. He won his first victory as early as B.C. 511. He rendered a great service to the development of the drama by introducing an actor distinct from the leader of the chorus, and so laying the foundation for the dialogue. But the dialogue was still quite subordinate to the lyrics of the chorus. In this department he won extraordinary celebrity by the grace and melody of his verses, which continued to be sung at Athens long after. Besides mythical subjects, he dealt with events of contemporary history, as the conquest of Miletus (<foreign lang="greek">Μίλητου Ἅλωσις</foreign>) by the Persians. At the representation of that event the audience burst into tears, and the poet was fined 1000 drachmae for recalling the disasters of his country, all further performance of the piece being prohibited ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 21</bibl>). Again, in his <title>Phoenissae</title> (so named after the chorus of Sidonian women) he dealt with the battle of Salamis. This play, which was put on the stage by Themistocles in 478, was the model of Aeschylus's <title>Persae.</title> Phrynichus, like Aeschylus, is said to have died in Sicily.

<head orig="Phylé">Phyle</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φυλή</foreign>). The Greek term for a division of a nation, connected by (supposed) descent from a common ancestor of the stock. Thus the population of Attica, even before Solon, was divided into four phylae, tracing their origin from four legendary sons of Ion, and called Geleontes, Hopletes, Aegicores, and Argades. Probably the division was local, the names referring to the peculiarity or main occupation of the members of each division; for Hopletes appears to mean warriors, Aegicores, goat-herds, and Argades, agriculturalists. The meaning of Geleontes (or Teleontes) is perhaps “the shining.” (See <ref type="cross" target="crossionic-tribes">Ionic Tribes</ref>.) Each phylé was presided over by a <foreign lang="greek">φυλοβασιλεύς</foreign> (king of the phylé) and divided into three <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> (brotherhoods, see <ref type="cross" target="crossphratria">Phratria</ref>), each <hi rend="italic">phratria</hi> being subdivided into thirty families. Each family contained about thirty households, and was named after a supposed common progenitor, in whose honour the households celebrated a common cult. Similarly the <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> and phylae were united by the worship of special protecting deities. These old Ionic phylae were suppressed by Clisthenes, who divided the people into ten entirely different phylae, named after ancient heroes (Erechtheïs, Aegeïs, <cb /> Pandionis, Leontis, Acamantis, Oeneïs, Cecropis, Hippothontis, Aiantis, Antiochis). They were subdivided into fifty <hi rend="italic">naucrariae</hi> and one hundred <seg lang="la">demi.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemus">Demus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In B.C. 307, in honour of Demetrius Poliorcetes and his father Antigonis, the phylae were increased by two, called Demetrias and Antigonis, which names were afterwards changed, in honour of Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt and Attalus I. of Pergamon, into Ptolemais and Attalis. In later times, another, Adrianis, was added in honour of the emperor Hadrian. Besides priests for the cult of their eponymous hero, the phylae had presidents, called <foreign lang="greek">φύλαρχοι</foreign>, and treasurers (<foreign lang="greek">ταμίαι</foreign>). The assemblies were always held in Athens, and were concerned, not only with the special affairs of the phylé, but also with State business, especially the notification of the persons liable to State burdens. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>.) The ten phylae of Clisthenes served also as a foundation for the organization of the army. The forces were raised when required from the muster-roll of the phylae, and divided accordingly into ten battalions, which were themselves also called phylae.</p>
 <p>The Dorian stock was generally divided into three phylae: Hylleis, Dymanes, and Pamphyli, purporting to be named after Hyllus, son of Heracles, and Dymas and Pamphylus, sons of king Aegimius. When families not of Dorian origin formed part of the forces of the State, they constituted an additional phylé. In the purely Dorian state of Sparta the three phylae were divided into thirty <hi rend="italic">obae</hi>, answering to the families at Athens. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdoris">Doris</ref>.

A day having been fixed for their union, Demophoön set sail for Athens, in order to arrange affairs at home, promising to return at an appointed time. He did not come, however, at the end of the period which he had fixed, and Phyllis, fancying herself deserted, put an end to her existence. The trees that sprang up around her tomb were said at a certain season to mourn her untimely fate by their leaves withering and falling to the ground. ( <bibl n="Hyg.

<head orig="Pictūra">Pictura</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γραφή, ζῳγραφία</foreign>). Painting. Among the Greeks painting developed into an independent art much later than sculpture, though it was used very early for decorative purposes. This is proved by the evidence of painted vases belonging to the ages of the most primitive civilization, and by the mural paintings discovered by Schliemann at Tiryns. Many students of the subject regard it as suggested and developed by polychrome embroidery or textile work. Homer makes no mention of painting, but speaks of pictures woven on garments, as on the robe of Helen and the veil of Heré; while two of the earliest known artists of Greece (Acesas and Helicon) were weavers by trade. It is certain that the influence of Oriental tapestries is largely felt in Greek painting. Klein and Milchhöfer think that both painting and sculpture were preceded by coloured relief.</p>
 <p>The scanty notices in ancient authors respecting the first discoveries in this art connect it with historical persons, and not with mythical names, as in the case of sculpture. Thus it is said (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 16</bibl>) that either Philocles, the Egyptian, or Cleanthes of Corinth was the first to draw outline sketches; that Telephanes of Sicyon developed them further; that Ecphantus of Corinth introduced painting in single tints (monochrome); and that Eumarus of Athens (in the second half of the sixth century) distinguished man and woman by giving the one a darker, the other a lighter colour. Cimon of Cleonae is mentioned as the originator of artistic drawing in profile (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 56</bibl>, cf. 90). It is further said of him that he gave variety to the face by making it look backwards or upwards or downwards, and freedom to the limbs by duly rendering the joints; also that he was the first to represent the veins of the human body, and to make the folds of the drapery fall more naturally (ib. 56).</p>
 <p>Painting did not, however, make any decided advance until the middle of the fifth century B.C., though Pausanias states that in the sixth century, the Samiote Calliphon painted the Homeric battle of the ships. This advance was chiefly due to Polygnotus of Thasos, who painted at Athens, and with whom as a real art painting may be said to begin. Among other claims to distinction it is attributed to him that he gave greater variety of expression to the face, which hitherto had been rigidly severe. His works, most of them large compositions rich in figures, give evidence of a lofty and poetic conception; they appear to have been, in great part, mural paintings for decorating the interior of public buildings (Pausan. x. 25-31; i. 15, 22. 6). The colours were first applied in uniform tints, so as to fill in the outlines, and fresh lines and touches were then added to indicate where the limbs and muscles began, and the folds of the garments. The drawing and the combination of colours were the chief considerations; light and shade were wanting, and no attention was paid 
<pb n="1252" /><cb />
 to perspective. It is doubtful whether at this early time, besides mural paintings executed <hi rend="italic">al fresco</hi> on carefully smoothed stucco-priming with plain water-colours, there were any pictures on panels, such as afterwards became common; but we may fairly assume it. These were painted on wooden panels <seg lang="la">in tempera</seg>—i. e. with colours mixed with various kinds of distemper, such as gum or size, to make them more adhesive. The art was still limited by its traditions, and each figure had its name carefully painted over it. A good deal of symbolism was tolerated—i. e. a single tree or a house or a piece of water was introduced to suggest a whole scene, which the spectator's imagination was supposed to supply. The range of colours was also still scanty, for Cicero tells us that Polygnotus used only four tints.</p>
 <p>In the same century the encaustic method of painting was discovered, though not elaborated till the following century. The process, as described in Roman times by Vitruvius (vii. 9), was as follows: “The medium used was melted white wax (<seg lang="la">cera punica</seg>), mixed with oil to make it more fluid. The pot containing the wax was kept over a brazier while the painter was at work, in order to keep the melted wax from solidifying. The stucco itself was prepared by a coating of hot wax applied with a brush or <seg lang="la">cestrum</seg>, and it was polished by being rubbed with a wax candle, and finally with a clean linen cloth. After the picture was painted the wax colours were fixed, partly melted into the stucco, and blended with the wax of the ground by the help of a charcoal brazier, which was held close to the surface of the painting, and gradually moved over its whole extent.” The encaustic method had several advantages over painting <seg lang="la">in tempera:</seg> it lasted longer and was more proof against damp, while the colouring was much brighter; on the other hand, it was much more laborious and slow, which explains the fact that the majority of encaustic paintings were of small size.</p>
 <p>While the pictures of Polygnotus certainly did not deceive by too much truth to nature, it was his younger contemporary, the Samian Agatharchus, who practised scene-painting (<foreign lang="greek">σκηνογραφία</foreign>) at Athens, and thus gave an impulse to the attempt at illusory effect and the use of perspective. He painted the scenery for a play of Aeschylus (Vitruv. vii. <hi rend="italic">praef.</hi> 10), and decorated the interior of the house of Alcibiades ( <title>Alcib.</title> 17). The Athenian Apollodorus (about B.C. 420) <figure id="fig.01252">
<head orig="Still-life. (Pompeian Painting.)">Still-life. (Pompeian Painting.)</head>
</figure> was the actual founder of an entirely new artistic style, which strove to effect illusion by means of the resources of painting. He was the first to give his pictures the appearance of reality, the first to bring painting into just repute (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 60</bibl>). He also led the way in the <cb /> proper management of the fusion of colours and their due gradation in different degrees of light and shade. It was to this that he owed his title of “shadow-painter” (<foreign lang="greek">σκιαγράφος</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Attic School</hi> flourished till about the end of the fifth century, when this art was for some time neglected at Athens, but made another important advance in the towns of Asia Minor, especially at Ephesus. The principal merits of this, the Ionic School, consist in richer and more delicate colouring, a more perfect system of pictorial representation, rendering on a flat surface the relief and variety of nature, and the consequent attainment of the greatest possible illusion. Its principal representatives were Zeuxis of Heraclea and Parrhasius of Ephesus; Timanthes also produced remarkable works, though not an adherent of the same school. It was opposed by the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sicyonian School</hi>, founded by Eupompus of Sicyon, and developed by Pamphilus of Amphipolis, which aimed at greater precision of technical training, very careful and characteristic drawing, and a sober and effective colouring (Pliny , l. c. 75<bibl n="Plin.  76" default="NO">Pliny, 76</bibl>). Pausias, a member of this school, invented the art of foreshortening and of painting on vaulted ceilings, besides perfecting the encaustic art, which was much more favourable for purposes of illusion and picturesque effectiveness than painting <seg lang="la">in tempera</seg> (ib. 123-127). Greek painting reached its summit in the works of <ref type="cross" target="crossapelles">Apelles</ref> (q.v.) of Cos, in the second half of the fourth century; he knew how to combine the merits of the Ionian and the Sicyonian Schools, the perfect grace of the former with the severe accuracy of the latter.</p>
 <p>After him the most famous artist was Protogenes of Caunus. The following contemporaries, some older and some younger than himself, deserve also to be mentioned: Nicomachus and Aristides of Thebes, Euphranor of Corinth, Nicias of Athens, the Egyptian Antiphilus, Theon of Samos, and Aëtion. After the age of Alexander the art of painting was characterized by a striving after naturalism, combined with a predilection for the representation of common, every-day scenes, and of still-life. Pictures of a small size came into favour, their models being objects taken from common life, such as barber-shops, cobblers' stalls, estables, etc., such as one finds in the genre pictures and still-life paintings of the Netherlands. Lewd paintings also became popular, this branch of art being known as Pornographia, or Rhyparographia. At last, as art degenerated, even the floors were adorned with painting, and objects, such as melon-rinds, bits of food, etc., were delineated so as to produce the effect of a room in disorder. Such a curious bit of realism was the “Unswept Floor” (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσάρωτος οἶκος</foreign>) at Pergamum, by Sosus. Callicles and Calates were famous painters of obscene pictures, while Piraeicus was noted for his scenes from still-life. Among painters of the loftier style the last noteworthy artist was Timomachus of Byzantium. 
<pb n="1253" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Among the Romans a few solitary names of early painters are mentioned—for instance, Fabius Pictor and the poet Pacuvius (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 19</bibl>); but nothing is known as to the value of their paintings, which served to decorate buildings. The way in which landscapes were represented by a certain S. Tadius (or Ludius (?), ib. 116; the best MS. has <seg lang="la">studio</seg>) in the reign of Augustus is mentioned <figure id="fig.01253">
<head orig="Landscape Painting from Pompeii. (Reber.)">Landscape Painting from Pompeii. (Reber.)</head>
</figure> as a novelty. These landscapes were mainly for purposes of decoration (Vitruv. vii. 5). Indeed, the love of display peculiar to the Romans, which had led them gradually to accumulate the principal works of the old Greek masters at Rome as ornaments for their public and private edifices, brought about an extraordinary development of decorative art, attested by the numerous mural paintings that have been found in Italy, chiefly at Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>
 <p>These paintings were mostly executed <hi rend="italic">al fresco</hi> on damp stucco, seldom with colours <seg lang="la">in tempera</seg> on <cb /> the dry surface. The principal subjects represented are figures from the world of myth, such as Maenads, Centaurs male and female, Satyrs, etc.; scenes from mythology and heroic legends, frequently copies of famous Greek originals, one of the best examples of which is Achilles delivering Briseïs to the heralds (see p. 222); landscapes; still-life; animals, and also scenes from real life. From a technical point of view these works do not go beyond the limits of light decorative painting, and are especially wanting in correct perspective; but they show fine harmony, varied gradation, and delicate blending of colour, and frequently a surprising depth and sincerity of expression, qualities which must have characterized the lost masterpieces of the ancient artists to a much more remarkable degree, and cannot but give us a very high idea of them. One of the finest mural paintings is that known as the “Aldobrandini Marriage,” discovered in 1606 near the Arch of Gallienus, now in the Library of the Vatican at Rome, and named after its first owner, Cardinal Aldobrandini. It is copied from an excellent Greek original, and represents, in the style of a relief, the preparations 
<pb n="1254" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01254">
<head orig="The Aldobrandini Marriage. (Vatican.)">The Aldobrandini Marriage. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure>
 for a marriage. “It is composed,” says Woermann (<title>History of Painting</title>, i. 115), “not pictorially, but yet with taste. It exhibits several individual motives of much beauty; its colouring is soft and harmonious; and it is instinct with that placid and serious charm which belongs only to the antique. In technical execution, however, the work is insignificant, and in no way rises above the ordinary handling of the Roman house-decorator in similar subjects.” The Vatican Library also possesses an important series of landscapes from the <title>Odyssey</title>, found during the excavations on the Esquiline in 1848-1850. Landscapes of this kind are mentioned by Vitruvius (vii. 5), among the subjects with which corridors used to be decorated in the early times. They represent the adventure with the Laestrygones, the story of Circé, and the visit of Odysseus to the realm of Hades, thus illustrating a continuous portion of the poem ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 10. 80" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>x. 80</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 11. 600" default="NO"> Od., xi. 600</bibl>). The predominant colours are a yellowish brown and a greenish blue, and the pictures are divided from one another by pilasters of a brilliant red. They furnish interesting examples of the landscape-painting of the last days of the Republic or the first of the Empire, and, in point of importance, stand alone among all the remains of ancient painting. On mosaic-painting and vase-painting, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmusivum-opus">Musivum Opus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvas">Vas</ref>.</p>
 <p>The ancients painted on stucco, wood (a thin slab called <foreign lang="greek">πίναξ</foreign>, and in Latin <seg lang="la">tabula</seg>) which was primed with whitening (<foreign lang="greek">λελευκωμένος</foreign>), stone, and marble. Canvas (<seg lang="la">linteum</seg>) was used but rarely (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 51" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 51</bibl>). When used it was stretched on wood or pasted in several layers.</p>
 <p>The processes of painting are represented in several works of ancient art—e. g. in three mural paintings from Pompeii. Even some of the implements and materials used by artists have been discovered. Thus, in 1849, at St. Médard-des-Prés in La Vendée, a grave was opened containing a female skeleton surrounded by eighty small vessels of glass, in most of which remains of ancient pigments were still preserved. Besides these there was a small cup of brown glass (a); a knife of cedar-wood with its blade reduced to rust (b); a small bronze box (c) with a movable lid and four partitions, holding materials for pigments; a mortar of alabaster, and a smaller one of bronze (d); one or two elegant bronze spoons (e), either for removing colours from the palette or for adding some liquid to mix them; a small shovel, made of rock crystal, containing gold embedded in gum (f); <cb /> and an oblong palette of basalt (g). There were also two small cylinders of amber and two brushhandles of bone. One of the glass vessels contained bits of resin; another, wax; a third, a mixture of both; a fourth, a mixture of lampblack and wax, with traces of sebacic acid, possibly due to the presence of oil. <figure id="fig.01254.2"><head>Paint-box and Implements for Painting. (First published by FillonB. , <title>Description de la Villa et du Tombeau d'une Femme Artiste Gallo-romaine</title>, Fontenay, 1849.)</head></figure></p>
 <p>Our principal information about ancient pigments (<foreign lang="greek">φάρμακα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">medicamenta, pigmenta</seg>) comes from Theophrastus (<title>De Lapidibus</title>), Dioscorides (bk. v.), Vitruvius (vii.), and the elder Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33." default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii.</bibl> and xxxv.). It is observed by Cicero in the <title>Brutus</title>, 70, that only four colours were used by Polygnotus, Zeuxis, Timanthes, and their contemporaries, as contrasted with their successors, Aëtion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and Apelles. Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 50</bibl>), who identified the colours as white (<seg lang="la">melinum</seg>), yellow (<title>sil Atticum</title>), red (<title>Sinopis Pontica</title>), and black (<seg lang="la">atramentum</seg>), even places Aëtion, Nicomachus, Apelles, and Melanthius under the same limitation. But it is hardly probable that such important colours as blue and green were dispensed with, even in the primitive art of Polygnotus, much less in the more advanced art of Zeuxis and his contemporaries, and least of all in that of Apelles and Protogenes. The earliest artists, however, may well have used comparatively few colours, and those of the simplest kind, the <seg lang="la">colores austeri</seg> of Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 30</bibl>), as contrasted with the <seg lang="la">colores floridi</seg>, such as vermilion, “Armenian blue,” “dragon's blood,” malachite green, indigo, and purple. These were characteristic of later developments of art, and were so costly that they were not paid for by the artists, but by those who gave them their commissions (ib. 44; Vitruv. vii. 5, 8). 
<pb n="1255" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The pigments known to the ancients were as follows:</p>
 <p><title>White.</title>—The pigment used in Greece was a “pipe-clay” called <seg lang="la">melinum</seg>, found in veins in the island of Melos. It was not available for frescopainting (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 49" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 49</bibl>). A white earth of Eretria was employed by Nicomachus and Parrhasius (ib. 38). A commoner pigment was the <title>creta Selinusia</title> of Selinus in Sicily, used for mural paintings (ib. 49, 194), and the <seg lang="la">creta anularia</seg>, made by mixing chalk with the glass composition worn in the rings of the poor (ib. 48). For fresco-painting they used <seg lang="la">paraetonium</seg>, a hydrated silicate of magnesia, so called from a cliff on the African coast near Egypt (ib. 30), which in Rome was adulterated with <title>creta Cimolia</title> (ib. 36). For other purposes they employed white-lead (<foreign lang="greek">ψιμύθιον</foreign>, <seg lang="la">cerussa</seg>), an artificial product, the finest sorts of which came from Rhodes, Corinth, and Sparta. It is carbonate of lead, and is still used under various names (e. g. ceruse). It is sold in its crude form as “Chemnitz or Vienna white,” and mixed with sulphate of barium in “Dutch, Hamburg, and Venetian white.” See <ref type="cross" target="crosscerussa">Cerussa</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Yellow.</title>—The pigments in use were yellow ochre and orpiment. The best kind of yellow ochre (<foreign lang="greek">ὤχρα</foreign>; La&lt;*&gt;. <hi rend="italic">sil</hi>) was found in the mines of Laurium. It was also found in Scyros, Achaia, Gaul, Cappadocia, Cyprus, and Lydia. The Attic variety was first used by Polygnotus and Micon; it was afterwards preferred for the high lights, while the kinds from Scyros and Lydia were reserved for the shadows (id. xxxiii. 158-160, xxxvii. 179). It is a diluted brown ochre or hydrated peroxide of iron, being composed of oxygen, water, and iron, mixed with more or less clay. Orpiment, or trisulphide of arsenic (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρσενικόν</foreign>: <seg lang="la">auripigmentum</seg>), was of two kinds: (1) of a golden yellow, from Mysia on the coast of the Hellespont; and</p>
 <p>(2) a duller kind, from Pontus and Cappadocia (Dioscorides, v. 120). It could not be used for frescoes (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 49" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 49</bibl>). Yellow ochre and orpiment (under the name of “king's or Chinese yellow”) are still in use.</p>
 <p><title>Red.</title>—One of the oldest pigments was ruddle (<foreign lang="greek">μίλτος</foreign>; <seg lang="la">rubrica</seg>). This is a red earth coloured by sesquioxide of iron. In the Homeric age it was used to ornament the bows of ships. In later times the clay from which Greek vases were made owed its brilliant hue to the ruddle of Cape Colias on the Attic coast ( Suid. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Κωλιάδος κέραμος</foreign>, and Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 152" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 152</bibl>). The best kind came from Cappadocia, by way of Sinopé (hence called <title>Sinopis Pontica</title>, ib. 31, 36, xxxiii. 117), or through Ephesus (Strabo, p. 540). It was also found in North Africa (<seg lang="la">cicerculum</seg>, Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 32</bibl>), especially in Egypt and at Carthage; also in Spain and the Balearic Islands, and Lemnos and Ceos. There was a treaty forbidding the export of ruddle from Ceos except only to Athens (Hicks, <title>Gr. Historical Inscriptions</title>, p. 186). It could be artificially produced by calcining yellow ochre, a discovery due to Cydias , a contemporary of Euphranor (Theophr. l. c. 53). Another mineral supplying a red, sometimes a yellow, pigment, was sandarach (<foreign lang="greek">σανδαράχη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">sandaraca</seg>), found in Paphlagonia, probably disulphide of arsenic. As this mineral is poisonous, the mortality in the mines was very high. An artificial substitute, called <seg lang="la">cerussa usta</seg>, or <seg lang="la">usta</seg> alone, was therefore generally preferred. This was obtained by burning white lead, a discovery attributed to the painter Nicias (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 38</bibl>). <cb /> The result is “red lead”—i. e. red oxide of lead. There was besides a colour compounded of equal parts of ruddle and sandarach, called <hi rend="italic">sandyx</hi> (ib. 40), which is also the designation of a natural pigment of which little is known ( <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 4. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>iv. 45</bibl>). Of greater importance than these is cinnabar (Gr. originally <foreign lang="greek">κιννάβαρι</foreign>, afterwards <foreign lang="greek">ἄμμιον</foreign>: <seg lang="la">minium</seg>), found in Spain, especially at Sisapo (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 121" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 121</bibl>). An artificial kind was made at Ephesus from the red sand of the <title>agri Cilbiani.</title> This discovery is assigned to Callias (ib. 113). The name <seg lang="la">cinnabari</seg> was often erroneously given to a red resin, now called dragon's-blood, and produced from the <seg lang="la">calamus draco</seg>, a kind of palm growing in the Sunda Islands and elsewhere. The ancients probably imported it from the island of Socotra, as it is a product of the Somali coast on the adjacent mainland of Africa.—A <hi rend="italic">purple</hi> pigment (<foreign lang="greek">ὄστρειον</foreign>; <seg lang="la">ostrum, purpurissum</seg>) was prepared by mixing <seg lang="la">creta argentaria</seg> with the purple secretion of the <seg lang="la">murex</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspurpura">Purpura</ref>); the best kind was made at Puteoli (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 45</bibl>). <figure id="fig.01255">
<head orig="Painter at Work. (Pompeian Caricature.)">Painter at Work. (Pompeian Caricature.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p><title>Blue.</title>—The pigment used from the earliest times was called in Greek <foreign lang="greek">κύανος</foreign>, in Latin <seg lang="la">caeruleum</seg>, a blue silicate of copper, generally mixed with carbonate of lime (chalk). It is not to be confounded with the modern <seg lang="la">caeruleum</seg>, which is stannate of cobalt. <foreign lang="greek">Κύανος</foreign> was found in small quantities in copper mines, and artificial kinds were made in Scythia, Cyprus, and Egypt (Theophr. l. c. 51, 55). Vitruvius mentions only the artificial <seg lang="la">caeruleum</seg> of Alexandria and Puteoli. The method of manufacturing it was brought from Egypt by Vestorius. It was prepared by heating strongly together sand, <seg lang="la">flos nitri</seg> (carbonate of soda), and filings of copper. This “Egyptian azure” was reproduced by Sir Humphry Davy, by taking fifteen parts by weight of carbonate of soda, twenty of powdered opaque flints, and three of copper filings, and heating them strongly for two hours. The product, when pulverized, supplied a fine deep sky blue. The “Alexandrian frit” is in part a species of artificial <seg lang="la">lapis lazuli</seg>, the colouring matter of which is naturally inherent in a hard siliceous stone. It was not available for fresco-painting, but could be used for painting <seg lang="la">in tempera</seg> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 162" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 162</bibl>). The name <foreign lang="greek">κύανος</foreign> was given to a blue mineral, which is to be identified as <seg lang="la">lapis lazuli</seg>, a silicate of sodium, calcium, and aluminium, with a sulphur compound of sodium. This was pounded into a pigment, now known as ultramarine. <foreign lang="greek">Κύανος</foreign> was also the name of the blue carbonate of copper from the copper mines of Cyprus, where <seg lang="la">lapis lazuli</seg> is not to be found. Artificial blue pigments were produced by colouring pulverized glass with carbonate of copper. “Armenian blue” (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρμένιον</foreign>) is described by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 47</bibl>) as made from a mineral like <seg lang="la">chrysocolla</seg> (malachite?) in colour, the best kinds being almost as good as <seg lang="la">caeruleum.</seg> It is probably a kind of ultramarine.—Indigo (<hi rend="italic">indicum</hi>) was also used. The way in which it is mentioned <figure id="fig.01256">
<head orig="Specimen of Pompeian Mural-painting. (Reber.)">Specimen of Pompeian Mural-painting. (Reber.)</head>
</figure> in Vitruvius (vii. 9, 6, and 10, 4) implies that it had been recently introduced. 
<pb n="1256" /><cb /> It could not be used for frescoes. Modern experiment has proved that the colouring basis of the blue found in ancient mural paintings is oxide of copper. Cobalt has also been discovered in ancient specimens of transparent blue glass.</p>
 <p><title>Green.</title>—Several pigments were in use: (1) <seg lang="la">chrysocolla</seg> (or malachite (?), hydrated dicarbonate of copper), pounded and sifted, and mixed with alum and woad (<seg lang="la">lutum</seg>, Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 87" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 87</bibl>). Malachite green, sometimes called mountain, or Hungary, green, is also a modern pigment.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Creta viridis</title>, the best kind of which came from Smyrna (Vitruv. vii. 7, 4). It is a species of ochre containing silica, oxide of iron, magnesia, potash, and water; and is still used under the names of terra verte, verdetta, green earth, Verona green, green bice, or holly green.</p>
 <p>(3) Verdigris (<foreign lang="greek">ἰός</foreign>; <seg lang="la">aerugo, aeruca</seg>, Vitruv. vii. 12, 1). This is an acetate of copper (sometimes crystallized), i. e. a compound of acetic acid and oxide of copper. Malachite green and Verona green have both been traced in ancient paintings. Verdigris has not been found; hence it has been conjectured that what was originally a diacetate of copper has in the course of centuries changed into carbonate of copper (l. c. p. 112). It is described as “the least durable of copper greens; light fades it in water; damp and foul air first bleach it, and then turn it black.”</p>
 <p><title>Black.</title>—The pigment (<foreign lang="greek">μέλαν</foreign>: <seg lang="la">atramentum</seg>) was almost always produced by combustion. Polygnotus and Micon produced it by drying and burning the lees of wine (<foreign lang="greek">τρύγινον</foreign>). Apelles was the discoverer of “ivory black” (<seg lang="la">elephantinum</seg>, Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 42</bibl>). A common material was the <cb /> smoke of burned resin (our lamp-black), or burned pine-twigs (Vitruv. vii. 10, 1). Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 41</bibl>) also mentions a natural black pigment which is difficult to identify; it may be peat, or else oxide of iron, or oxide of manganese. The best black pigment was called <title>atramentum Indicum</title> (<foreign lang="greek">μέλαν Ἰνδικόν</foreign>), doubtless the same as “Chinese black,” which originally found its way to the West through India, and thus obtained its alternative name of “Indian ink.” But it cannot be used for frescoes, and no traces of it have been found in the mural paintings of antiquity. The black in these paintings is always carbonaceous.</p>
 <p>Some of the remains of ancient colours and paintings at Pompeii, and in the Baths of Titus and of Livia, and elsewhere, were analyzed by Sir Humphry Davy (<title>Phil. Trans. Royal Society</title>, 1815, pp. 97-124: <title>Some Experiments and Observations on the Colours used in Painting by the Ancients</title>). In an earthen vase from the Baths of Titus containing a variety of colours, the reds proved to be red oxide of lead, with two iron ochres of different tints, a dull red and a purplish red “nearly of the same tint as prussiate of copper;” all three were mixed with chalk or carbonate of lime (p. 101). The yellows were pure ochres mixed with carbonate of lime, and ochre mixed with red oxide of lead and carbonate of lime (p. 104). The blues were a kind of smalt, with carbonate of lime (p. 106). Of greens there were three varieties; “one, which approached to olive, was the common green earth of Verona; another, which was pale grass-green, had the character of carbonate of copper mixed with chalk; and a third, which was sea-green, was a green combination of copper mixed with blue copper frit” (p. 110). A pale, rose-coloured substance, found in the Baths of Titus, which in its interior “had a lustre approaching to that of carmine,” was found to be either of vegetable or animal origin; if the latter, it was most probably a specimen of Tyrian purple (pp. 113-115). In the “Aldobrandini Marriage” the reds and yellows were all ochres; the greens, preparations of copper; the blues, “Alexandrian frit;” the purple, a mixture of red ochre and carbonate of copper; the browns, mixtures of ochres and black; the whites were all carbonates of lime.</p>

<head orig="Picumnus">Picumnus</head>

 <p> An old Italian god of agriculture, credited with the invention of the use of manure. He was said to be the husband of Pomona. His brother Pilumnus was honoured by bakers as the inventor of the pestle (<seg lang="la">pilum</seg>) for crushing corn; and the two together were protecting deities to women in child-bed and to new-born infants. Hence, in the country, festal couches were set for them in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> when children were safely brought to birth. According to another ancient view, there were three divinities protecting mother and child, who prevented the mischievous intrusion of Silvanus into the house. These powers (representing the triumph of civilization over the wild forest life) were impersonated by three men, who went round the house in the night, and knocked on the threshold of the front and back doors, first with a hatchet and then with a pestle, and lastly swept them with a broom ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg.

 <p>The names of these deities were Intercidona, god of the hewing of timbers, Pilumnus, of the crushing of corn into meal by the pestle, and Deverra, of the sweeping together of grain (Varro, quoted by St. Augustine, <title>De Civitate Dei</title>, vi. 9). Picumnus, as appears in the name, is identical with <ref type="cross" target="crosspicus">Picus</ref> (q.v.).

 <p> An Italian god of agriculture, and especially of manure, hence called son of Stercutus (“the dunger”—i. e. Saturn). He also appears as a forest-god with prophetic powers, and as father of Faunus ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>viii. 48</bibl>). In Latin legend he plays a prominent part as a warlike hero, the earliest king of Latium, of great wealth, who was finally changed into a woodpecker (<seg lang="la">picus</seg>) (ib. 187- 190). According to Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov.

Probably Picus was originally the woodpecker, the symbol of Mars as giver of fertility and warlike prowess, and from this symbol there was developed a separate deity. <cb />

<div2 id="crosspignus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pignus">Pignus</head>

 <p> In Roman law, a pledge seized by a creditor, or given to him, to secure the performance of an obligation.</p>
 <p>I. If given, a contractual relation exists between the pledgor and pledgee (<seg lang="la">pignori dans, accipiens</seg>). The pledgee is bound to restore the pledge when the debt is paid; the pledgor is bound to reimburse the pledgee for necessary outlays. The pledgee had originally no right except to hold the pledge until the debt was paid. Even when the debtor was in default, the creditor could not sell the pledge (<seg lang="la">pignus distrahere</seg>) unless this had been specially agreed. At a later period such an agreement was presumed, and in the final development of the Roman law an agreement that the pledge should not be sold had no effect except that the creditor, before selling, was obliged to give the debtor three warnings (<seg lang="la">denuntiationes</seg>) instead of one. In case the sum realized by the creditor exceeded the amount due him, he was bound to restore the surplus (<seg lang="la">superfluum, hyperocha</seg>) to the pledgor. The pledgee had no right to use the property pledged unless this was specially agreed. If the property yielded <seg lang="la">fructus</seg> (as was the case, for example, with land), and if, as was not uncommon, it was agreed that the creditor should appropriate the yield in lieu of interest on the debt, the contract was termed <hi rend="italic">antichresis.</hi></p>
 <p>Originally, the pledgee had no right against third persons. His possession was indeed protected: but if he lost possession, he could not recover as against an honest conveyee or pledgee in 
<pb n="1258" /><cb />
 possession. The only method of giving him such a right of recovery was to break loose from the conception of pignus and make him owner, with an understanding that when the debt was paid he should reconvey the property to the debtor. This form of pledge (which did not require delivery of possession) was termed <seg lang="la">fiducia</seg> (q. v.). Towards the close of the republican period, however, the law of pignus was so developed as to admit lien without conveyance of ownership or delivery of possession, and to give the pledgee a right of recovery as against third persons. The first step was to recognize that a landlord (<seg lang="la">locator fundi</seg>) might obtain, by contract, a lien (<hi rend="italic">pignus</hi>) on all the chattels which his tenant (<seg lang="la">colonus</seg>) brought upon the farm (<seg lang="la">invecta et illata</seg>). When the tenant was in arrears with his rent, summary proceedings were devised to put the landlord in possession (<title>interdictum Salvianum</title>). The next step was to enable the landlord to follow up any such chattels as were removed from the farm. This was done by the <title>actio Serviana.</title> A form of <hi rend="italic">pignus</hi> was thus developed which operated <seg lang="la">in rem</seg>, and therefore created a <seg lang="la">ius in re.</seg> The third and last step was to extend the new principle to all contractual pledges, with or without possession. This was done by the <title>actio quasi Serviana.</title> A similar form of lien had been developed in Greece; and at the time of Cicero the term <seg lang="la">hypotheca</seg> was being naturalized among the Romans, and in the early Empire the jurists spoke of the <title>actio quasi Serviana seu hypothecaria.</title> The terms <hi rend="italic">pignus</hi> and <seg lang="la">hypotheca</seg> were thenceforth used interchangeably, although the more careful writers restricted <hi rend="italic">pignus</hi> to the pledge in possession (which was most frequent in the case of movables) and <seg lang="la">hypotheca</seg> to the pledge without possession.</p>
 <p>In the earlier civil law it is probable that only corporeal things could be given <hi rend="italic">pignori.</hi> In the later development of the law it was possible to create a lien on almost any property right, even on a right of action or debt (<seg lang="la">pignus nominis</seg>). The right of the pledgee might itself be pledged (<hi rend="italic">pignus pignoris</hi>). It was finally recognized that all the assets of an estate might be hypothecated.</p>
 <p>Successive hypothecations of the same property were possible. As between the different pledgees, the general rule was <seg lang="la">prior potior.</seg></p>
 <p>II. Pledges might be seized without the consent of the owners. For the <seg lang="la">pignoris capio</seg> of certain favoured creditors in early Roman law, see <ref type="cross" target="crossactio">Actio</ref> in the Appendix. For the power of the magistrates to enforce obedience to their commands by <seg lang="la">pignoris capio</seg>, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>. Out of the latter power was gradually developed the seizure of property to satisfy judgment (<seg lang="la">pignus in causa iudicati captum</seg>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σφαῖρα</foreign>). (1) A ball. Ballplaying was a very favourite occupation among both Greeks and Romans, though regarded less as a game than as an exercise for strengthening the muscles and cultivating suppleness of limb. The earliest mention of such an exercise is found in two passages of the <title>Odyssey</title> (vi. 100; viii. 370). In the second passage, ball-tossing is an adjunct of the dance, and this choric ball-play was very popular at Sparta (Athen. i. 24 b), and long survived. In the Athenian gymnasia a special room (<foreign lang="greek">σφαιριστήριον</foreign>) was devoted to this and similar exercises with balls. The practice was introduced at Rome only in the later days of the Republic ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 10" default="NO"> Sat., 10</bibl>), but when once established it took a strong hold on persons of all classes and of all ages—old men as well as boys adopting it (Seneca, <title>De Brev. Vit.</title> 13; Sueton. <bibl n="Cic. Aug. 83" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>83</bibl>; Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> iii. 1, 8).</p>
 <p>The different kinds of balls in use were as follows: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the <seg lang="la">harpastum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μικρὰ σφαῖρα</foreign>), a small hand-ball stuffed with hair; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the <seg lang="la">pila trigonalis</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μέση σφαῖρα</foreign>), the one most used, also a hand-ball stuffed with hair, but larger than the <seg lang="la">harpastum; (c)</seg> the <seg lang="la">arenaria</seg>, of doubtful nature; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the <seg lang="la">paganica</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μεγάλη σφαῖρα</foreign>), a large ball stuffed with feathers ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 45</bibl>); and (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) the <seg lang="la">follis</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">κενὴ σφαῖρα</foreign>), a ball filled with air, like the modern football. There is nothing to show that in classical times the Greeks and Romans had any games of ball involving the use of a bat or racquet, though in one form of game the ball was struck with the palm of the hand (<seg lang="la">lusus pilae cum palma</seg>, Med. Lat.).</p>
 <p>The following are the principal technical terms used in playing ball: <foreign lang="greek">διδόναι, βάλλειν, ἀφιέναι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">dare, mittere, iactare</seg>, “to throw a ball;” <foreign lang="greek">λαμβάνειν, δέχεσθαι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">accipere, excipere, captare</seg>, “to catch;” <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιπέμπειν, ἀνταφιέναι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">remittere, reddere</seg>, “to throw <hi rend="italic">back</hi> a ball to the sender;” <foreign lang="greek">οὐρανία</foreign>, <seg lang="la">datatim ludere</seg>, “to play at catch;” <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόρραξις</foreign>, “bounce-ball;” <foreign lang="greek">φενίνδα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">fallere</seg>, “pretending to throw to one player when really throwing to another.”</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Games at Ball</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σφαιρομαχίαι</foreign>). (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The game called <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίσκυρος</foreign> (also <foreign lang="greek">ἐφηβικὴ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκοινος</foreign>: <bibl n="Poll.  9. 104" default="NO">Poll.ix. 104</bibl>, Eustath. l. c.). In this game the ground was marked by two base lines (<foreign lang="greek">γραμμαὶ κατόπιν</foreign>), and another line drawn parallel to them through the middle of the ground, presumably more than a stone's-throw from them, which was called <foreign lang="greek">σκῦρος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">λατύπη</foreign>, because it was marked with finely broken stones. The ball was placed upon this line (whence the name <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίσκυρος</foreign>), and the players 
<pb n="1259" /><cb />
 started at the same moment from their respective base-lines. The player who could first seize the ball threw it as far as he could towards the enemy's base-line: the object was to force the line of enemies back by constantly returning the ball farther and farther over their heads until they were driven over their own base-line. Clearly, getting the first throw by fast running at the start must have been an enormous advantage (cf. Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg>  <bibl n="Cic. Leg. 1." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Leg.</title>i.</bibl> p. 633 C). It is not improbable, though there is no proof of it, that the contest of the <seg lang="la">pagani</seg> (whence the name <seg lang="la">paganica</seg> for the third-sized Roman ball) was a game of this kind. It seems to have been regarded as a game for the young (<foreign lang="greek">ἐφηβική</foreign>), and for large numbers (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκοινος</foreign>).</p>
 <p><title>(b) Harpastum</title> (or, by the older name, <title>Pheninda;</title> in Athen. and Eustath. <foreign lang="greek">φαινίνδα</foreign>: in Clem. Alex. <foreign lang="greek">φενίνδα</foreign>: in <title>Etym. Mag.</title> <foreign lang="greek">φεννίς, φενίνδα, φενακίνδα</foreign>). This game cannot with certainty be reconstructed, but the following seems to us an outline most consistent with our authorities. (Galen, <foreign lang="greek">περὶ τῆς σμικρᾶς σφαίρας</foreign>: Sidon. Apoll. v. 17; <bibl n="Mart.  4. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 19</bibl>; vii. 32; xiv. 48; Athen. i. p. 25; Eustath. l. c.; <bibl n="Poll.  9. 105" default="NO">Poll.ix. 105</bibl>). There were clearly two sides, for Galen lays stress on the fact that there is emulation (<foreign lang="greek">φιλοτιμία</foreign>), which exercises the <foreign lang="greek">ψυχή</foreign>, as well as movements which exercise the limbs and the eye: there are presumably base-lines as goals, without which it is hard to understand what he says about generalship (<foreign lang="greek">στρατηγία</foreign>), and positions won and lost. The ground was then probably rectangular, the two ends being base-lines, and it was divided by a line in the centre (<seg lang="la">trames</seg>) into two equal camps. There was always one “middle player,” a special feature of the game, called <hi rend="italic">medicurrens</hi> (Sidon.), or <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μεταξύ</foreign> (Galen: cf. <seg lang="la">vagus</seg>, <bibl n="Mart.  7. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vii. 32</bibl>), each side being probably so represented in turn: how the “innings” of the <hi rend="italic">medicurrens</hi> ended we do not know, but perhaps he gave up his place to one of the other side whenever a point was scored against his side. As to the identity of <hi rend="italic">pheninda</hi> with <seg lang="la">harpastum</seg> we have the positive statement of Athenaeus that it was the old name of <seg lang="la">harpastum</seg>, the belief of Pollux that it was, and the fact that in some places it still went by that name; and, moreover, no writer mentions both games as distinct.</p>
 <p><title>(c) Trigon.</title> In this favourite game of the Romans there were no “sides,” but each played for himself; still it was a legitimate game, played for winning and losing. The following description may, as it seems to us, best meet the accounts which we have: There were three players standing in the form of an equilateral triangle. Each player had one ball to start with, and played for his own score. He would wish both his fellowplayers to miss their strokes, and drop the ball as often as possible. He might send his ball to either player (presumably there was some rule about sending it fairly within their reach), and he might do so either by catching the ball which came to him and throwing it, or by “fiving” it, so as either to strike it back to the sender (<seg lang="la">repercutere</seg>) or sideways to the third player (<seg lang="la">expulsare</seg>). Obviously the most disastrous position would be receiving three balls nearly at the same time—if, for instance, his own ball is smartly struck back to him, and almost simultaneously the two others have been sent to him; obviously, also, his easiest position was to receive only one ball at a time with a fair interval before the next. The winner was <cb /> probably the player who allowed his ball to drop the fewest times. A fourth person stood by to count the misses (<seg lang="la">numerare</seg>). The ball used was a hard one, covered with leather and stuffed with hair, as stated above. See Becq de Fouquières, <title>Les Jeux des Anciens</title>, pp. 176-211.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) In very late times (i. e. in the Byzantine Period) a game of ball was played on horseback bearing a strong resemblance to our modern “polo” (Cinnamus, <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 6. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>vi. 4</bibl>). It was confined chiefly to princes and the higher nobles, who took sides and struck at a leather ball with a sort of curved stick provided with a catgut network, the object being for each party to drive the ball over the opponents' base-line (<foreign lang="greek">πέρας</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">pilicrepus</seg>, so often found in Latin, means in general a professional ball-player as distinguished from an amateur, and is applied to teachers of scientific ball-playing and to those who juggled with balls. These last were also called <seg lang="la">pilarii.</seg> The following illustration, from the Baths of Titus at Rome, shows a <seg lang="la">pilicrepus</seg> (the person with a beard) giving a lesson in <seg lang="la">trigon</seg> to three young men: <figure id="fig.01259">

It must, however, be remembered that the ancients, who employed a numerous class of well-educated slaves in the character of readers, secretaries, and amanuenses, did not stand so much in need of an artificial aid to the eyesight as we moderns do.

<head orig="Pinaria Gens">Pinaria Gens</head>

 <p> One of the most ancient patrician gentes at Rome, tracing its origin to a time long previous to the foundation of the city. The legend related that when Hercules came into Italy he was hospitably received, on the spot where Rome was afterwards built, by the Potitii and the Pinarii, two of the most distinguished families in the country. The hero, in return, taught them the way in which he was to be worshipped; but as the Pinarii were not at hand when the sacrificial banquet was ready, and did not come till the entrails of the victim were eaten, Hercules, in anger, determined that the Pinarii should, in all future time, be excluded from partaking of the entrails of the victims, and that in all matters relating to his worship should be inferior to the Potitii (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 7</bibl>; <bibl n="Dionys.  1. 40" default="NO">Dionys.i. 40</bibl>; Macrob. iii. 6, 12). These two families continued to be the hereditary priests of Hercules till the censorship of Appius Claudius (B.C. 312), who purchased from the Potitii the knowledge of the sacred rites, and intrusted them to public slaves; whereat the god was so angry that the whole Potitia gens, containing twelve families and thirty grown-up men, perished within a year, or, according to other accounts, within thirty days, and Appius himself became blind (<bibl n="Liv.  9. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 29</bibl>). The Pinarii did not share in the guilt of communicating the sacred knowledge, and therefore did not receive the same punishment as the Potitii, but continued in existence to the latest times. It appears that the worship of Hercules by the Potitii and Pinarii was a <seg lang="la">sacrum gentilicium</seg> belonging to these gentes, and that in the time of Appius Claudius these <seg lang="la">sacra privata</seg> were made <seg lang="la">sacra publica.</seg> The Pinarii were divided into the families of Mamercinus, Natta, Posca, Rusca, and Scarpus, but none of them obtained sufficient importance to require a separate notice.

<div2 id="crosspindarus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pindărus">Pindarus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πίνδαρος</foreign>). The greatest of the Greek lyric poets, son of Daïphantos, was born at or near Thebes, B.C. 522. He belonged to a noble and priestly family and was carefully educated. His musical training was received from the best masters of the time, among whom is mentioned, perhaps without sufficient warrant, Lasos of Hermioné, the regenerator of the dithyramb. <cb /> Familiar is the story of his unsuccessful contest with Corinna, and of the advice which she gave the youthful poet when he crowded the opening of one of his hymns with mythological figures: “Sow with the hand and not with the whole sack.” Pindar began his career as a local poet early in life, and the Tenth Pythian, which is said to have been composed when he was only twenty years old, shows all the elements of his future greatness. By the time of the Persian War Pindar had risen to the position of a national poet, and though he was a good Theban and a stanch aristocrat, though he was bound by the ties of his family, which belonged to the old nobility, and by the ties of his people, who sided with the Persians, he was too true a Greek, too thoroughly Pan-Hellenic not to be proud of the victory of the Greeks of Attica over the Persians, and the victory of the Greeks of Sicily over the Carthaginians. According to the well-known story the high praise which he bestowed on Athens as the ‘Stay of Greece’ roused the indignation of the Thebans, who imposed on him a heavy fine, which the Athenians reimbursed twofold, adding, as is further reported, a statue and other honours. Like the other lyric poets of his time, Pindar travelled far and wide in fulfilment of his calling, though, doubtless, he often sent his song instead of going himself. A long sojourn in Sicily is beyond a doubt, and Aegina, which he loved only next to Thebes, must have been to him a second home; nor is it unlikely that he knew Macedon in the North and Cyrené in the South. He was received everywhere with veneration and bore himself as a peer of princes. And not only was he honoured by the highest on earth, but the gods themselves are said to have shown him special favour and to have sent him at last the boon of a swift and easy death as he rested his head on the lap of his favourite in the theatre or in the gymnasium of Argos. The date of that death we do not know with certainty, but his life can hardly have been prolonged much beyond the middle of the fifth century. The reverence felt for the poet in his lifetime was paid to his genius after his death, and when Thebes was pillaged and destroyed by the Macedonian soldiery in the next century, the house of Pindar was spared by the express order of Alexander the Great, whose ancestor he had celebrated in song.</p>
 <p>Pindar was a consummate master of the whole domain of lyric poetry, as is shown by the fragments of his hymns (<foreign lang="greek">ὕμνοι</foreign>), his paeans (<foreign lang="greek">παιᾶνες</foreign>), his dancing-songs (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπορχήματα</foreign>), his processional songs (<foreign lang="greek">προσόδια</foreign>), his songs for choruses of virgins (<foreign lang="greek">παρθένια</foreign>), his songs of praise (<foreign lang="greek">ἐγκώμια</foreign>), his drinking-songs (<foreign lang="greek">παροίνια</foreign>) and catches (<foreign lang="greek">σκολιά</foreign>), his dithyrambs (<foreign lang="greek">διθύραμβοι</foreign>) and dirges (<foreign lang="greek">θρῆνοι</foreign>). These show the breadth of his genius; the height of it we must estimate by the one group of his poems which we have entire, the Songs of Victory (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπινίκια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίνικοι</foreign>), composed to celebrate the successful contestants in the great national games of Greece, Olympian (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυμπιονῖκαι</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">ὕμνοι</foreign>), Pythian (<foreign lang="greek">Πυθιονῖκαι</foreign>), Nemean (<foreign lang="greek">Νεμεονῖκαι</foreign>), Isthmian (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰσθμιονῖκαι</foreign>). In these poems, which were delivered by trained choruses, the poet is the spokesman, and this is an important point for the appreciation of the often intensely personal tone of the lyric chorus as compared with the chorus of the drama. A victory at one of the great games was a matter of joy and 
<pb n="1262" /><cb />
 pride not only to the victor himself and to his kindred, but also to the community, so that there is a peculiar blending of the private with the public, of intimate allusion with wide scope. The elements are many: festal joy, wise and thoughtful counsel, the uplifting of the heart in prayer for prince and for people, the inspiration of a fervent patriotism; but the victory is the dominant theme, and that victory is raised to the high level of the eternal prevalence of the beautiful and the good over the foul and the base; the victor is transfigured into a glorious personification of his race, and the present is reflected, magnified, illuminated in the mirror of the mythic past. The epinician becomes the triumphal song of Hellenism and the triumphal song of idealized humanity. To understand this it is necessary to understand also the deep religious and ethical and artistic meaning of the great games of Greece, of which the Olympian Games were the crown; so that whatever else a man might achieve or suffer, an Olympian victory was sunshiné for life. ‘To spend and to toil’—this is the motto of him who would attain; a motto that means self-sacrifice, submission to authority, devotion to the public weal; and this motto is incarnate in the Pindaric Heracles, who is held up as the type of achievement and endurance in obedience to the divine will. Heracles is the Doric ideal, and Pindar his last prophet. Pindar still lives in the world of the old gods, still believes in the array of their shining forms, and if he rejects a myth that dishonours god, his faith is intact, the priestly temper conquers. Life was a serious thing to him. The melancholy strain that is not absent from Homer, that dominates Hesiod, makes itself heard in Pindar. We hear over and over again of the shortness and the sorrowfulness of human life, the transitoriness of its pleasures, our utter dependence upon the will of an envious god. And yet it is not a melancholy that degenerates into doleful brooding. It is ‘a spur that the clear spirit doth raise’ to noble action. But for noble action noble blood is necessary. Pindar is an aristocrat, and to him the blood of the gods is the true channel of the grace of the gods. Government fitly reposes only in the hands of those who are endowed by nature for the work of the ruler, and what is true of government is true also of art. Art is divine, and the eagle, the bird of Zeus, is its chosen symbol. Ineffectual chatter is all that can be expected of crows and daws. But the divine right of government, the divine right of genius, is not absolute, and is to be exercised only in obedience to divine law. Native endowment being god-given involves the duty of self-restraint, which is imposed by the giver. And this “measure,” which is the summary of Pindaric ethics, brings with it the recompense of reward in that other world which Pindar sees and makes us see with a startling sense of reality.</p>
 <p>Pindar was claimed by the ancient rhetoricians as an exemplar of the “austere” style, as belonging to the same order as Aeschylus in tragedy, as Thucydides in history. His style is the grand style, but grand after the antique pattern of grandeur, which combines weight and fulness of meaning with artistic exactness in every detail. The copiousness of Pindar is a commonplace, but the subtle art of Pindar is often overlooked in the earlier characterizations of his poetry, and it is safe to follow the poet himself, who bears ample witness <cb /> to his own excellences. Opulence, elevation, force, cunning workmanship, vigorous execution—these are all claimed by the poet for himself; and his splendour, his loftiness, his wealth of imagery, his forceful concentration, his varied metaphor, his vivid narrative, his superb diction must be recognized at once, though the admiration of these characteristics is indefinitely enhanced by closer study. But what withdraws itself from the reader is the sequence of thought, the planfulness of the epinician, and yet this is a point which Pindar also insists on. This planfulness, though disregarded or denied by literary people ancient and modern, has been diligently sought after by the best commentators and by the most thoughtful students of Pindar, and while no consensus has been reached, much has been done to show sequence and balance, to reproduce the architectonic principle, to bring out the relations of the myth which forms the heart of every ode to the rest of the organism, to trace the thread of the thought and to make audible the burden of the song as revealed by the recurrence of significant words and significant sentiments. Despite much straining and much overinterpretation, Pindar is much nearer to us than he was ever before. The music and the dance are lost without which the full significance of a Pindaric ode cannot be appreciated, but the rhythm remains, and under the guidance of the rhythm we can penetrate into many of the recesses of Pindaric songs.</p>
 <p>The great Pindaric MSS. are, according to Mommsen's notation, <hi rend="bold">A</hi> (Ambrosianus A), twelfth century; <hi rend="bold">B</hi> (Vaticanus B), also of the twelfth century; <hi rend="bold">C</hi> (Parisinus G), belongs to the close of the twelfth century); <hi rend="bold">D</hi> (Mediceus B) in the Laurentian Library at Florence, thirteenth or fourteenth century. The inferior MSS. are called Thomani, Moschopulei, Tricliniani, as they represent the editions of Thomas Magister, Moschopulos, and Triclinius. A good reading in them is a lucky accident.</p>
 <p>The older scholia to Pindar go back to Didymus as Didymus goes back to an earlier time, and they have a certain value for the constitution of the text; the later scholia have very little value of any kind. A critical edition was begun by E. Abel with Nemeans and Isthmians in 1884.</p>

Hermann did much for Pindar, and Pindar was the favourite battle-ground of Hermann and his rival Boeckh, whose monumental edition of Pindar, two volumes in three parts <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1811-22)</bibl>, is still unexcelled for sagacious criticism, wide historical vision, reconstructive power.

Dissen is over-acute, sees too much, explains too much, analyzes too much. Schneidewin's edition of Dissen's Olympians and Pythians <bibl default="NO">(1847)</bibl> is a good advance.

<pb n="1264" /><cb /> This peninsula, which is sometimes called by the general name of Piraeeus, contained three harbours: <ref type="cross" target="crosspiraeeus">Piraeeus</ref> proper on the western side, by far the largest of the three; <hi rend="SmallCaps">Zea</hi> on the eastern side, separated from the Piraeus by a narrow isthmus; and <ref type="cross" target="crossmunychia">Munychia</ref> (Pharnari), still farther to the east. The northern part of the great harbour of the Piraeus was divided into three smaller harbours: Zea for corn-vessels, Aphrodisium for merchant-ships in general, and Cantharus for ships of war. It was through the suggestion of Themistocles that the Athenians were induced to make use of the harbour of Piraeeus. Before the Persian Wars their principal harbour was Phalerum, which was not situated in the Piraean peninsula at all, but lay to the east of Munychia. At the entrance of the harbour of the Piraeus there were two promontories—the one on the right-hand, called Alcimus (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄλκιμος</foreign>), on which was the tomb of Themistocles (Pausan. i. 1, 2), and Eëtionea (<foreign lang="greek">Ἠετιώνεια</foreign>), where the Four Hundred built a fortress ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8. 90" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii. 90</bibl>). The Piraeus had a good-sized population, especially of resident aliens, who were attracted by its facility for trade. The town was strongly fortified by Themistocles, and was connected with Athens by the Long Walls, due to Pericles. The narrow entrance to its harbour was protected by two great mole-heads, across which a huge chain could be drawn to keep out hostile ships.</p>

Pirithoüs was still more ambitious, and resolved to carry off Persephoné (Proserpina), the wife of the king of the lower world. Theseus would not desert his friend in the enterprise, though he knew the risk which they ran. The two friends accordingly descended to the lower world; but they were seized by Pluto and fastened to a rock, where they both remained till Heracles visited Hades.

The Pisatae obtained this honour in the eighth Olympiad (B.C. 748), with the assistance of Phidon, tyrant of Argos, and also a second time in the thirty-fourth Olympiad (B.C. 644), by means of their own king Pantaleon.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Πισιδική</foreign>). An inland district of Asia Minor, lying north of Lycia and Pamphylia. It was a mountainous region, inhabited by a warlike people, who maintained their independence against all the successive rulers of Asia Minor. The Romans never subdued the Pisidians in their mountain fortresses, though they took some of the towns on the outskirts of their country—for example, Antiochia, which was made a colony with the <title>ius Italicum.</title> In fact, the northern part, in which Antiochia stood, had originally belonged to Phrygia, and was more accessible and more civilized than the mountains which formed the proper country of the Pisidians. Nominally, the country was considered a part of Pamphylia, till the new subdivision of the Empire under Constantine, when Pisidia was made a separate province. The country is still inhabited by wild tribes, among whom travelling is dangerous; and it is therefore little known. Ancient writers say that it contained, amidst its rugged mountains, some fertile valleys, where the olive flourished; and it also produced the gum storax, some medicinal plants, and salt. On the southern slope of the Taurus several rivers flowed through Pisidia and Pamphylia into the <cb /> Pamphylian Gulf, the chief of which were the Cestrus and the Catarrhactes; and on the northern the mountain streams form some large salt lakes— namely, Ascania (Hoiran and Egerdir), south of Antiochia, Caralius, or Pusgusa (Bei Shehr or Kereli), southeast of the former, and Trogitis (Soghla) further to the southeast, in Isauria. Special names were given to certain districts, which are sometimes spoken of as parts of Pisidia, sometimes as distinct countries—namely, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cibyrātis</hi>, in the southwest, along the north of Lycia, and <ref type="cross" target="crosscabalia">Cabalia</ref>, the southwest corner of Cibyratis itself; <ref type="cross" target="crossmilyas">Milyas</ref>, the district east of Cibyratis, northeast of Lycia and northwest of Pamphylia; and <ref type="cross" target="crossisauria">Isauria</ref>, in the east of Pisidia, on the borders of Lycaonia.

<head orig="Pisistrătus">Pisistratus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πεισίστρατος</foreign>). An Athenian, son of Hippocrates, named after Pisistratus, the youngest son of Nestor , since the family of Hippocrates was of Pylian origin, and traced their descent to Neleus, the father of Nestor. The mother of Pisistratus (whose name we do not know) was first cousin to the mother of Solon. Pisistratus grew up equally distinguished for personal beauty and for mental endowments. The relationship between him and Solon naturally drew them together, and a close friendship sprang up between them. He assisted <ref type="cross" target="crosssolon">Solon</ref> (q.v.) by his eloquence in persuading the Athenians to renew their struggle with the Megarians for the possession of Salamis, and he afterwards fought with bravery in the expedition which Solon led against the island. When Solon, after the establishment of his constitution, retired for a time from Athens, the old rivalry between the parties of the Plain, the Highlands, and the Coast broke out into open feud. The party of the Plain, comprising chiefly the landed proprietors, was headed by Lycurgus; that of the Coast, consisting of the wealthier classes not belonging to the nobles, by Megacles, the son of Alcmaeon ; the party of the Highlands, which aimed at more of political freedom and equality than either of the two others, was the one at the head of which Pisistratus placed himself, because they seemed the most likely to be useful in the furtherance of his ambitious designs. His liberality, as well as his military and oratorical abilities, gained him the support of a large body of citizens. Solon, on his return, quickly saw through the designs of Pisistratus, who listened with respect to his advice, though he prosecuted his schemes none the less diligently. When Pisistratus found his plans sufficiently ripe for execution, he one day made his appearance in the agora with his mules and his own person exhibiting recent wounds, pretending that he had been nearly assassinated by his enemies as he was riding into the country. An assembly of the people was forthwith called, in which one of his partisans proposed that a body-guard of fifty citizens, armed with clubs, should be granted to him. It was in vain 
<pb n="1266" /><cb />
 that Solon opposed this; the guard was given him. Through the neglect or connivance of the people, Pisistratus took this opportunity of raising a much larger force, with which he seized the citadel, B.C. 560, thus becoming what the Greeks called <foreign lang="greek">τύραννος</foreign> of Athens. See the account in Aristotle,</p>
 <p>Having secured to himself the substance of power, he made no further change in the constitution or in the laws, which he administered ably and well. His first usurpation lasted but a short time. Before his power was firmly rooted, the factions headed by Megacles and Lycurgus combined, and Pisistratus was compelled to evacuate Athens. He remained in banishment six years. Meantime the factions of Megacles and Lycurgus revived their old feuds, and Megacles made overtures to Pisistratus, offering to reinstate him in the tyranny if he would connect himself with him by receiving his daughter in marriage. The proposal was accepted by Pisistratus, and the following stratagem was devised for accomplishing his restoration, according to the account of Herodotus: A maiden named Phya, of remarkable stature and beauty, was dressed as Athené in a full suit of armour, and placed in a chariot, with Pisistratus by her side. The chariot was then driven towards the city, heralds being sent on before to announce that Athené in person was bringing back Pisistratus to her Acropolis. The report spread rapidly, and those in the city believing that the woman was really their tutelary goddess, worshipped her, and admitted Pisistratus. Pisistratus nominally performed his part of the contract with Megacles; but, in consequence of the insulting manner in which he treated his wife, Megacles again made common cause with Lycurgus, and Pisistratus was a second time compelled to evacuate Athens. He retired to Eretria in Euboea, and employed the next ten years in making preparations to regain his power. At the end of that time he invaded Attica with the forces he had raised, and also supported by Lygdamis of Naxos with a considerable body of troops. He defeated his opponents near the temple of Athené at Pallené, and then entered Athens without opposition. Lygdamis was rewarded by being established as tyrant of Naxos, which island Pisistratus conquered (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslygdamis">Lygdamis</ref>).</p>
 <p>Having now become tyrant of Athens for the third time, Pisistratus adopted measures to secure the undisturbed possession of his supremacy. He took a body of foreign mercenaries into his pay, and seized as hostages the children of several of the principal citizens, placing them in the custody of Lygdamis in Naxos. He maintained at the same time the form of Solon's institutions, only taking care, as his sons did after him, that the highest offices should always be held by some member of the family. He not only exacted obedience to the laws from his subjects and friends, but himself set the example of submitting to them. On one occasion he even appeared before the Areopagus to answer a charge of murder, which, however, was not prosecuted. Athens was indebted to him for many stately and useful buildings. Among these may be mentioned a temple to the Pythian Apollo, and a magnificent temple to the Olympian Zeus, which remained unfinished for several centuries, and was at length completed by the emperor Hadrian. Besides these, the Lyceum, a garden with stately buildings a short distance from the city, was the work of Pisistratus, as also the Fountain of the <cb /> Nine Springs. Pisistratus also encouraged literature in various ways. It was apparently under his auspices that Thespis introduced at Athens his rude form of tragedy (B.C. 535), and that dramatic contests were made a regular part of the Attic Dionysia. It is to Pisistratus that tradition ascribes the first written text of the whole of the poems of Homer, as to which see Flach, <bibl default="NO"><title>Peisistratos und seine literarische Thätigkeit</title> (Tübingen, 1885)</bibl>; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>, pp. 838-39. Pisistratus is also said to have been the first person in Greece who collected a library, to which he generously allowed the public access.</p>
 <p>By his first wife Pisistratus had two sons, Hippias and Hipparchus. By his second wife, Timonassa, he had also two sons, Iophon and Thessalus, who are rarely mentioned. He had also a bastard son, Hegesistratus, whom he made tyrant of Sigeum after taking that town from the Mitylenaeans. Pisistratus died at an advanced age in 527, and was succeeded in the tyranny by his eldest son Hippias; but Hippias and his brother Hipparchus appear to have administered the affairs of the State with so little outward distinction that they are frequently spoken of as though they had been joint tyrants. They continued the government on the same principles as their father. Thucydides (vi. 54) speaks in terms of high commendation of the virtue and intelligence with which their rule was exercised till the death of Hipparchus. Hipparchus inherited his father's literary tastes. Several distinguished poets lived at Athens under the patronage of Hipparchus, as, for example, Simonides of Ceos, Anacreon of Teos, Lasus of Hermioné, and Onomacritus.</p>
 <p>After the murder of Hipparchus in 514, an account of which is given under <ref type="cross" target="crossharmodius">Harmodius</ref>, a great change ensued in the character of the government. Under the influence of revengeful feelings and fears for his own safety, Hippias now became a morose and suspicious tyrant. He put to death great numbers of the citizens, and raised money by extraordinary imposts. His old enemies the Alcmaeonidae, to whom Megacles belonged, availed themselves of the growing discontent of the citizens; and after one or two unsuccessful attempts they at length succeeded, supported by a large force under Cleomenes, in expelling the Pisistratidae from Attica. Hippias and his connections retired to Sigeum in 510. The family of the tyrants was condemned to perpetual banishment, a sentence which was maintained even in after times, when decrees of amnesty were passed. Hippias afterward repaired to the court of Darius, and looked forward to a restoration to his country by the aid of the Persians. He accompanied the expedition sent under Datis and Artaphernes, and pointed out to the Persians the plain of Marathon as the most suitable place for their landing. He was now (490) of great age. According to some accounts, he fell in the battle of Marathon; according to others, he died at Lemnos on his return. Hippias was the only one of the legitimate sons of Pisistratus who had children; but none of them attained distinction.

<head orig="Piso">Piso</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crosscalpurnius">Calpurnius</ref>. The name of a distinguished plebeian family at Rome. The name of Piso, like many other Roman cognomens, is connected with agriculture, the noblest and most 
<pb n="1267" /><cb />
 honourable pursuit of the ancient Romans: it comes from the verb <hi rend="italic">pisere</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pinsere</hi>, and refers to the pounding or grinding of corn. (1) A Roman who was taken prisoner at the battle of Cannae, B.C. 216; was praetor urbanus 211, and afterward commanded as propraetor in Etruria 210. Piso, in his praetorship, proposed to the Senate that the Ludi Apollinares, which had been exhibited for the first time in the preceding year (212), should be repeated, and should be celebrated in future annually. The Senate passed a decree to this effect. The establishment of these games by their ancestor was commemorated on coins by the Pisones in later times.</p>
 <p>(2) C., son of No. 1, was praetor 186, and received Further Spain as his province. He returned to Rome in 184, and obtained a triumph for a victory he had gained over the Lusitani and Celtiberi. He was consul in 180, and died during his consulship.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pisones with the agnomen Caesonīnus</hi>.</p>
 <p>(3) L., received the agnomen Caesoninus because he originally belonged to the Caesonia gens. He was praetor in 154, and obtained the province of Further Spain, but was defeated by the Lusitani. He was consul in 148, and was sent to conduct the war against Carthage; he was succeeded in the command in the following year by Scipio.</p>
 <p>(4) L., son of No. 3, was consul 112 with M. Livius Drusus. In 107 he served as legatus to the consul, L. Cassius Longinus, who was sent into Gaul to oppose the Cimbri and their allies, and he fell together with the consul in the battle, in which the Roman army was utterly defeated by the Tigurini in the territory of the Allobroges. This Piso was the grandfather of Caesar's father-in-law, a circumstance to which Caesar himself alludes in recording his own victory over the Tigurini at a later time ( <title>B. G.</title> i. 7, 12).</p>
 <p>(5) L., son of No. 4, never rose to any of the offices of State, and is only known from the account given of him by Cicero in his violent invective against his son. He married the daughter of Calventius, a native of Cisalpine Gaul, who came from Placentia and settled at Rome; and hence Cicero calls his son, in contempt, a semi-Placentian.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, son of No. 5, was an unprincipled debauchee, and a cruel and corrupt magistrate. He is first mentioned in 59, when he was brought to trial by P. Clodius for plundering a province, of which he had the administration after his praetorship, and he was only acquitted by throwing himself at the feet of the judges. In the same year Caesar married his daughter Calpurnia; and through his influence Piso obtained the consulship for 58, having for his colleague A. Gabinius, who was indebted for the honour to Pompey. Both consuls supported Clodius in his measures against Cicero, which resulted in the banishment of the orator. The conduct of Piso in support of Clodius produced that extreme resentment in the mind of Cicero which he displayed against Piso on many subsequent occasions. At the expiration of his consulship Piso went to his province of Macedonia, where he remained during two years (57 and 56), plundering the province in the most shameless manner. In the latter of these years the Senate resolved that a successor should be appointed, and in the debate in the Senate which led to his recall Cicero attacked him in the most unmeasured terms in an oration which has come down to us (<title>De Provinciis Consularibus</title>). Piso, on his return (55), complained in the Senate <cb /> of the attack of Cicero, and justified the administration of his province, whereupon Cicero reiterated his charges in a speech which is likewise extant (<title>In Pisonem</title>). Cicero, however, did not venture to bring to trial the father-in-law of Caesar. In 50 Piso was censor with Appius Claudius Pulcher. On the breaking out of the Civil War (49) Piso accompanied Pompey in his flight from the city; and although he did not go with him across the sea, he still kept aloof from Caesar. He subsequently returned to Rome, and remained neutral during the remainder of the Civil War. After Caesar's death (44) Piso at first opposed Antony, but is afterwards mentioned as one of his partisans.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, son of No. 6, was consul B.C. 15, and afterwards obtained the province of Pamphylia; from thence he was recalled by Augustus in 11, in order to make war upon the Thracians, who had attacked the province of Macedonia. He was appointed by Tiberius <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi.</seg> While retaining the favour of the emperor, without condescending to servility, he at the same time earned the good-will of his fellow-citizens by the integrity and justice with which he governed the city. He died in A.D. 32, at the age of eighty, and was honoured by a decree of the Senate with a public funeral. It was to this Piso and his two sons that Horace addressed his epistle on the art of poetry (<title>Ars Poetica</title>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pisones with the agnomen Frugi. </hi></p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps"> Lucius,</hi> received from his integrity and conscientiousness the surname of Frugi, which is perhaps nearly equivalent to our “man of honour.” He was tribune of the plebs B.C. 149, in which year he proposed the first law for the punishment of extortion in the provinces. He was consul in 133, and carried on war against the slaves in Sicily. He was a staunch supporter of the aristocratic party, and offered a strong opposition to the measures of C. Gracchus. Piso was censor, but it is uncertain in what year. He wrote annals, which contained the history of Rome from the earliest period to the age in which Piso himself lived.</p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, son of No. 8, served with distinction under his father in Sicily in 133, and died in Spain about 111, whither he had gone as propraetor.</p>
 <p>(10) C., married Tullia, the daughter of Cicero, in 63, but was betrothed to her as early as 67. He was quaestor in 58, when he used every exertion to obtain the recall of his father-inlaw from banishment; but he died in 57 before Cicero's return to Rome. He is frequently mentioned by Cicero in terms of gratitude on account of the zeal which he had manifested in his behalf during his banishment.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Pisones without an agnomen</hi>.</p>
 <p>(11) C., consul B.C. 67, belonged to the high aristocratic party; and in his consulship opposed with the utmost vehemence the law of the tribune Gabinius, for giving Pompey the command of the war against the pirates. In 66 and 65, Piso administered the province of Narbonese Gaul as proconsul, and while there suppressed an insurrection of the Allobroges. In 63 he was accused of plundering the province, and was defended by Cicero. The latter charge was brought against Piso at the instigation of Caesar; and Piso, in revenge, implored Cicero, but without success, to accuse Caesar as one of the conspirators of Catiline.</p>
 <p>(12) M., usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Pupius Piso</hi>, because he was adopted by M. Pupius, when the latter was an old man. He retained, however, his family-name Piso, just as Scipio, after his adoption by Metellus, was called 
<pb n="1268" /><cb /> Metellus Scipio. On the death of L. Cinna, in 84, Piso married his wife Annia. In 83 he was appointed quaestor to the consul L. Scipio; but he quickly deserted this party, and went over to Sulla , who compelled him to divorce his wife on account of her previous connection with Cinna. After his praetorship, the year of which is uncertain, he received the province of Spain with the title of proconsul, and on his return to Rome in 69, enjoyed the honour of a triumph. He served in the Mithridatic War as a legatus of Pompey. He was elected consul for 61 through the influence of Pompey. In his consulship Piso gave great offence to Cicero, by not asking the orator first in the Senate for his opinion, and by taking P. Clodius under his protection after his violation of the mysteries of the Bona Dea. Cicero revenged himself on Piso, by preventing him from obtaining the province of Syria, which had been promised him. Piso, in his younger days, had so high a reputation as an orator, that Cicero was taken to him by his father, in order to receive instruction from him. He belonged to the Peripatetic School in philosophy, in which he received instruction from Staseas.</p>
 <p>(13) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn.</hi>, a young noble who had dissipated his fortune by his extravagance and profligacy, and therefore joined Catiline in what is usually called his first conspiracy (66). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscatilina">Catilina</ref>.) The Senate, anxious to get rid of Piso, sent him into Nearer Spain as quaestor, but with the rank and title of propraetor. His exactions in the province soon made him so hateful to the inhabitants that he was murdered by them. It was, however, supposed by some that he was murdered at the instigation of Pompey or of Crassus.</p>
 <p>(14) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn.</hi>, fought against Caesar in Africa (B.C. 46), and after the death of the dictator, joined Brutus and Cassius. He was subsequently pardoned, and returned to Rome; but he disdained to ask Augustus for any of the honours of the State, and was, without solicitation, raised to the consulship in 23.</p>
 <p>(15) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn.</hi>, son of No. 14, inherited all the pride and haughtiness of his father. He was consul B.C. 7, and was sent by Augustus as legate into Spain, where he made himself hated by his cruelty and avarice. Tiberius after his accession was chiefly jealous of Germanicus, his brother's son; and accordingly, when the eastern provinces were assigned to Germanicus in A.D. 18, Tiberius conferred upon Piso the command of Syria, in order that the latter might do everything in his power to thwart and oppose Germanicus. Plancina, the wife of Piso, was also urged on by Livia, the mother of the emperor, to vie with and annoy Agrippina. Germanicus and Agrippina were thus exposed to every species of insult and opposition from Piso and Plancina; and when Germanicus fell ill in the autumn of 19, he believed that he had been poisoned by them. Piso on his return to Rome (20) was accused of murdering Germanicus; the matter was investigated by the Senate; but before the investigation came to an end, Piso was found one morning in his room with his throat cut, and his sword lying by his side. It was generally supposed that, despairing of the emperor's protection, he had put an end to his own life, but others believed that Tiberius dreaded his revealing his secrets, and accordingly caused him to be put to death. The powerful influence of Livia secured the acquittal of Plancina. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgermanicus-caesar">Germanicus</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(16) C., the leader of the wellknown conspiracy against Nero in A.D. 65. Piso <cb /> himself did not form the plot; but as soon as he had joined it, his great popularity gained him many partisans. He possessed most of the qualities which the Romans prized—high birth, an eloquent address, liberality, and affability; and he also displayed a sufficient love of magnificence and luxury to suit the taste of the day, which would not have tolerated austerity of manner or character. The conspiracy was discovered by Milichus, a freedman of Flavius Scevinus, one of the conspirators. Piso thereupon opened his veins, and thus died. There is extant a poem in 261 lines, containing a panegyric on a certain Calpurnius Piso, who is probably the same person as the leader of the conspiracy against Nero.</p>
 <p>(17) L., surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Liciniānus</hi>, was the son of M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, and was adopted by one of the Pisones. On the accession of Galba to the throne, he adopted as his son and successor Piso Licinianus; but the latter only enjoyed the distinction four days, for Otho, who had hoped to receive this honour, induced the Praetorians to rise against the emperor. Piso fled for refuge into the Temple of Vesta, but was dragged out by soldiers, and despatched at the threshold of the temple, A.D. 69.

<head orig="Pistor">Pistor</head>

 <p> The Roman word for a baker, the Greek terms being <foreign lang="greek">ἀρτοποιός</foreign>, “bread-maker,” and <foreign lang="greek">ἀρτοπώλης</foreign>, “bread-seller.” The Latin term is from <hi rend="italic">pinso</hi>, and means literally “pounder.” Bakers are first mentioned in Greece in the fifth century B.C., but do not appear in Rome before the early part of the second century. They were usually freedmen or citizens of the lower class; but, owing to the importance attached by the State to the trade, it became one of some standing. There was a <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> or guild of bakers under Augustus, which <figure id="fig.01268">
<head orig="Baker's Sign found at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Baker's Sign found at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> served the State, and underTrajan it was formally organized with 100 members and special privileges. It was under the supervision of the <seg lang="la">praefectus annonae.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossannona">Annona</ref>.) Bread was distributed at Rome at the public expense, at first monthly, but in the third century daily; and at the beginning of the fourth century there were 254 public bakeries in the city. These made only the coarser kinds of bread, the finer sorts being produced at the private establishments.</p>
 <p>Baking was sometimes done in furnaces, as in the bake-shop (<seg lang="la">pistrina</seg>) excavated at Pompeii; or in the <seg lang="la">clibanus</seg>, a clay vessel, in which the dough was placed and then buried in hot ashes (Pet&lt;*&gt;. 35; see <ref type="cross" target="crossclibanus">Clibanus</ref>). Wheat-bread (<hi rend="italic">panis silig&lt;*&gt;eus</hi>) was the most common variety, as the ancients thoughtrye (<seg lang="la">secale</seg>) unfit to eat; and the quality of the flour determined the quality of the bread. Barley-bread (<seg lang="la">panis hordeaceus</seg>) was regarded as fit only for soldiers and slaves (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 74</bibl>). Spelt (<foreign lang="greek">ζειά</foreign>, <seg lang="la">far</seg>) was sometimes used for making a coarse bread.</p>
 <p>The dough for bread was prepared by moistening the flour with water, by adding salt, and then by kneading (<foreign lang="greek">μάττειν</foreign>, <seg lang="la">subigere, depsere</seg>) in a trough of wood or pottery. In large bakeries it appears to have been done by a sort of machine, the motive-power of which was supplied by an animal.

</figure></p>
 <p>The leaven (<foreign lang="greek">ζύμη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">fermentum</seg>) was prepared from cakes of barley and water, or from the surplus dough of the preceding day's batch, which was kneaded with salt, put into water, and kept till it fermented. The dough was shaped either by hand or in moulds (<seg lang="la">artoptae</seg>), and then placed in the oven (<foreign lang="greek">ἰπνός</foreign>, <seg lang="la">furnus</seg>) on a shovel (<seg lang="la">pala</seg>); but was sometimes baked on the hearth in the embers.</p>
 <p>Cake and fancy-bread were made in various forms by special confectioners (<foreign lang="greek">πλακουντοποιοί, πεμματουργοί</foreign>, <seg lang="la">clibanarii, dulciarii, crustularii</seg>, etc.), and were much used for sacrificial purposes. On these sweet preparations, see Athen. xiv. 643 e and f, and Pollux, vi. 75 foll. The sweetening was done with honey. See Blümner, <title>Technologie</title>, i. 1 foll.; and id. s. v. “Bäckerei” in Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler.</title>

 <p> “Baker,” a surname given to Iupiter by the Romans, because, when their city was taken by the Gauls, the god was believed to have inspired them with the idea of throwing down loaves from the Tarpeian Hill, where they were besieged, that the enemy might suppose that they were not in want of provisions, though, in reality, they were near surrendering through famine. This deceived the Gauls, and they soon withdrew (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, vi. 343; Lactant. i. 20, 33). This story is probably not the origin of the name <title>Pistor</title> as applied to Iupiter; but the name is best explained as “the Pounder” (<hi rend="italic">pinso</hi>), referring to his smiting with thunderbolts.

<head orig="Pittăcus">Pittacus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πιττακός</foreign>). A native of Mitylené in Lesbos, and one of the so-called Seven Sages of Greece, was born about B.C. 650. Having obtained popularity among his countrymen by successfully opposing the tyrant Melanchrus, he was intrusted with the command of a fleet in a war with the Athenians concerning some territory which they had seized in the island. In the course of this war the Athenian commander Phryno, a man of uncommon size and strength, challenged him to single combat. Providing himself with a net, which he concealed under his buckler, he took the first opportunity to throw it over the head of his antagonist, and by this means gained an easy victory. According to Strabo's account, Pittacus came into the field armed with a castingnet, a trident, and a dagger; and it is said that from this stratagem of the Mitylenean was borrowed the mode of fighting practised by the Roman gladiators called <seg lang="la">retiarii.</seg> From this time Pittacus was held in high esteem among the Mityleneans, and was intrusted with the supreme power in the State (Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> iii. 15). Among other valuable presents, his countrymen offered him as much of the lands which had been recovered from the Athenians as he chose; but he only accepted of so much as he could measure by a single cast of a javelin; and one half of this small portion he afterward dedicated to Apollo, saying, concerning the remainder, that “the half is better than the whole.” Cornelius Nepos says that the Mityleneans offered him many thousand acres, but that he took only a hundred. Pittacus displayed great moderation in his treatment of his 
<pb n="1270" /><cb />
 enemies, among whom one of the most violent was the poet Alcaeus, who frequently made him the object of his satire. Finding it necessary to lay severe restrictions upon drunkenness, to which the Lesbians were particularly addicted, Pittacus passed a law which subjected offenders of this class to double punishment for any crime committed in a state of intoxication. When he had established such regulations as seemed to him satisfactory, he resigned his power, which he had held for ten years, and retired to private life.</p>
 <p>Some of his famous sayings are as follows: “Power reveals the man;” “Whatever you do, do well;” “Watch for opportunities;” “Never talk of your plans before they are carried out.” The life of Pittacus is given by Diogenes Laertius.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">T. Bursa</hi>, tribune of the commons in B.C. 52. He took part in the troubles excited by the death of Clodius, and, on the expiration of his office, was accused and condemned, notwithstanding the interest made by Pompey in his behalf.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Munatius</hi>, a native of Tibur, was in early life a pupil of Cicero's, and obtained considerable eminence in the oratorical art. He afterward commanded a legion under Caesar in Gaul. On the assassination of that individual Plancus acted at first a very equivocal part, and frequently changed sides, attaching himself successively to each party according as it became powerful. Thus we find him, after the victory at Mutina, affecting the utmost zeal for the cause of Brutus and freedom; and subsequently, when he saw Antony reestablished in power, he went over to him with four legions which he had at the time under his command. He obtained upon this the consulship along with Lepidus, B.C. 42. Tired at last of Antony, he sided with Octavius, who received him with the utmost cordiality. It was Plancus who proposed in the Senate that the title of Augustus should be bestowed on Octavianus. The ancient writers reproach him with an absurd performance at the court of Cleopatra , in Alexandria, when he appeared on the public stage in the character of a sea-god, having his person painted green, and in a state of almost complete nudity, wearing a crown of reeds on his head, and with the tail of a fish attached to his body behind. Plancus, however, appears to have been a man of literary tastes, and we have an ode addressed to him by Horace on one occasion, when he had become suspected of disaffection by Augustus, and was meditating his departure from Italy ( <title>Ant.;</title> Vell. Paterc. ii. 63; Horat. <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. vii" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>i. vii</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius</hi>, a friend of Iulius Caesar, under whom he served both in the Gallic and the Civil Wars. Caesar, shortly before his death, nominated him to the government of Transalpine Gaul for B.C. 44, with the exception of the Narbonese and Belgic portions of the province, and also to the consulship for 42, with D. Brutus as his colleague. After Caesar's death Plancus hastened into Gaul, and took possession of his province. Here he prepared at first to support the Senate against Antony; but when Lepidus joined Antony, and their united forces threatened to overwhelm Plancus, the latter was persuaded by Asinius Pollio to follow his example, and to unite with Antony and Lepidus. Plancus, during his government of Gaul, founded the colonies of Lugdunum and Raurica. He was consul in 42, 
<pb n="1271" /><cb />
 according to the arrangement made by Caesar, and he subsequently followed Antony to Asia, where he remained for some years, and governed in succession the provinces of Asia and Syria. He deserted Antony in 32, shortly before the breaking out of the Civil War between the latter and Octavianus. He was favourably received by Octavianus, and continued to reside at Rome during the remainder of his life. It was on his proposal that Octavianus received the title of Augustus in 27; and the emperor conferred upon him the censorship in 22, with Paulus Aemilius Lepidus. Both the public and private life of Plancus were stained by numerous vices. One of Horace's odes ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>i. 7</bibl>) is addressed to him.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλάταια</foreign>), more commonly <hi rend="bold">Plataeae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλαταιαί</foreign>). An ancient city of Boeotia, on the northern slope of Mount Cithaeron, not far from the sources of the Asopus, and on the frontiers of Attica. It was said to have derived its name from Plataea, a daughter of Asopus. At an early period the Plataeans deserted the Boeotian Confederacy and placed themselves under the protection of Athens; and when the Persians invaded Attica, B.C. 490, they sent 1000 men to the assistance of the Athenians, and fought on their side at the battle of Marathon. Ten years afterward (480) their city was destroyed by the Persian army under Xerxes at the instigation of the Thebans; and the place was still in ruins in the following year (479), when the memorable battle was fought in their territory in which Mardonius was defeated, and the independence of Greece secured. In consequence of this victory, the territory of Plataea was declared inviolable. It now enjoyed a prosperity of fifty years; but in the third year of the Peloponnesian War (429) the Thebans persuaded the Spartans to attack the town, and after a siege of two years at length succeeded in obtaining possession of the place (427). Plataea was now razed to the ground, but was again rebuilt after the peace of Antalcidas (387). It was destroyed the third time by its inveterate enemies the Thebans in 374. It was once more restored under the Macedonian supremacy, and continued in existence till a very late period. See <bibl default="NO">Wiegand, <title>Platää</title> (1886)</bibl>.

<head orig="Plato">Plato</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλάτων</foreign>). The greatest of the Athenian philosophers. He was born May 26 (the seventh of Thargelion), B.C. 428, probably at Athens, though some say at Aegina ( <bibl n="Diog.  3. 2" default="NO">Diog. Laert.iii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Diog.  6" default="NO">Diog. Laert., 6</bibl>). He was of an aristocratic family, his father Aristo claiming descent from Codrus, the last of the Athenian kings, and his mother Perictioné being of the family of Sohn. His name was originally Aristocles, after his grandfather, but he was subsequently called <foreign lang="greek">Πλάτων</foreign>, in consequence of his fluency of speech, or, as others say, because of his broad (<foreign lang="greek">πλατύς</foreign>) forehead or his broad shoulders ( <bibl n="Diog.  3. 4" default="NO">Diog. Laert.iii. 4</bibl>). The <cb /> traditions that have come down regarding his birth and career are largely mythical, and are given by Diogenes Laertius. One story makes him the son of Apollo, and another tells how bees settled on his lips when a child, thus foreshadowing his honeyed eloquence ( <bibl n="Cic.  Div. 1. 46" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Div.</title>i. 46</bibl><bibl n="Cic.  Div. 78" default="NO" valid="yes"> Div., 78</bibl>). Plutarch relates that he was humpbacked, but this, perhaps, was not a natural defect; it may have first appeared late in life as a result of his severe studies ( <title>De Audiend. Poët.</title> 26, 53). Other ancient writers, on the contrary, speak in high terms of his manly and noble mien. The only authentic bust that we have of him is at present in the gallery at Florence. It was discovered near Athens in the fifteenth century, and purchased by Lorenzo de' Medici. In this bust the forehead of the philosopher is remarkably large. Plato first learned grammar, that is, reading and writing, from Dionysius. In gymnastics, Ariston was his teacher; and he excelled so much in these physical exercises that he entered, as is said, a public contest at the Isthmian and Pythian Games ( <bibl n="Diog.  3. 4" default="NO">Diog. Laert.iii. 4</bibl>). He studied painting and music under the tuition of Draco, a scholar of Damon , and Metellus of Agrigentum; but his favourite employment in his youthful years was poetry. The lively fancy and powerful style which his philosophical writings so amply display must naturally have impelled him, at an early period of life, to make some attempts at versification, which were assuredly not without influence on the beautiful form of his later works. After he had enjoyed the instruction of the most eminent teachers of poetry in all its forms, he proceeded himself to make an attempt in heroic verse; but when he compared his production with the masterpieces of Homer, he consigned it to the flames. He next tried lyric poetry, but with no better success; and finally turned his attention to dramatic composition. He elaborated four pieces, or a tetralogy, consisting of three separate tragedies and one satyric drama; but an accident induced him to quit this career, for which he was not probably fitted. A short time before the festival of Dionysus, when his pieces were to be brought upon the stage, he happened to hear Socrates conversing, and was so captivated by the charms of his manners as from that moment to abandon poetry, and apply himself earnestly to the study of philosophy. But, though Plato abandoned his poetic attempts, he still attended to the reading of the poets, particularly Homer, Aristophanes, and Sophron, as his favourite occupation; and he appears to have derived from them, in part, the dramatic arrangement of his dialogues. He had already heard the instructions of Cratylus, a disciple of the school of Heraclitus (Aristot. <title>Metaphys.</title> i. 6), and was now twenty years of age when he became acquainted with Socrates. He continued a professed disciple of that philosopher for the space of eight years, until the death of the latter. During all this period Socrates regarded him as one of his most faithful pupils, and Plato always cherished a deep affection and esteem for his master, so that when the latter was brought to trial he undertook to plead his cause; but the partiality and violence of the judges would not permit him to proceed. After the condemnation he presented his master with money sufficient to redeem his life, which, however, Socrates refused to accept. During his imprisonment Plato attended him, and was present at a conversation which he 
<pb n="1272" /><cb />
 held with his friends concerning the immortality of the soul, the substance of which he afterwards committed to writing in the dialogue entitled <title>Phaedo</title>, not, however, without interweaving his own opinions and language. Upon the death of his master he withdrew, with several other friends of Socrates, to Megara, where they were hospitably entertained by Euclid, and remained till the <hi rend="italic">émeute</hi> at Athens subsided. Brücker thinks that Plato received instruction in dialectics from Euclid. Cicero relates that the Megarean philosopher drew many of his opinions from Plato (Academ. <bibl n="Alex. Aphr. Quaest. 4" default="NO"> Quaest.4</bibl><bibl n="Alex. Aphr. Quaest. 42" default="NO"> Quaest., 42</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Desirous of making himself master of all the wisdom and learning which the age could furnish, Plato, after this, travelled into every country which was so far enlightened as to promise him any recompense for his labour. He first visited that part of Magna Graecia where a celebrated school of philosophy had been established by Pythagoras. It is commonly believed that Plato formally became a scholar of the Pythagoreans, and many persons are expressly named as his teachers in the doctrines of that sect of philosophy. But this multitude of teachers is of itself sufficient to excite suspicion; and, besides, Plato must then have been at least thirty years old, and was undoubtedly acquainted with the Pythagorean system long before his Italian voyage. How long Plato remained in Italy cannot be determined, since all the accounts relative to this point are deficient. But so much is certain, that he did not leave this country before he had gained the entire friendship of the principal Pythagoreans, of which they subsequently gave most unequivocal proofs. From Italy Plato went to Cyrené, the celebrated Greek colony in Africa. It is not certain whether he visited Sicily in passing. According to Apuleius, the object of his journey was to learn mathematics of Theodorus. This mathematician, whose fame perhaps surpassed his knowledge, had given instruction to the youth of Athens in this branch of science; and Plato, in all probability, merely wished now to complete his knowledge on this subject. From Cyrené he proceeded to Egypt, and, in order to travel with more safety upon his journey to the last-named country, he assumed the character of a merchant, and, as a seller of oil, passed through the kingdom of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Wherever he came, he obtained information from the Egyptian priests concerning their astronomical observations and calculations. It has been asserted that it was in Egypt that Plato acquired his opinions concerning the origin of the world, and learned the doctrines of transmigration and the immortality of the soul; but it is more than probable that he learned the latter doctrine from Socrates, and the former from the school of Pythagoras. It is not likely that Plato, in the habit of a merchant, could have obtained access to the sacred mysteries of Egypt; for, in the case of Pythagoras, the Egyptian priests were so unwilling to communicate their secrets to strangers that even a royal mandate was scarcely sufficient in a single instance to gain this permission. Little regard is therefore due to the opinions of those who assert that Plato derived his system of philosophy from the Egyptians (Iamblich. <title>Myst. Aeg.</title> i. 2, p. 3). That Plato's stay in Egypt extended to a period of thirteen years, as some maintain, or even three years, as others state, is highly incredible; especially as there is no trace in his works of Egyptian research, <cb /> and all that he tells us of Egypt indicates at most a very scanty acquaintance with the subject.</p>
 <p>After leaving Egypt, he went to Sicily in order to see the volcano of Aetna, and visited Syracuse at the time when Dionysius the Elder was reigning. At the court of Dionysius Plato became acquainted with Dio , the brother-in-law of the tyrant, and Dio endeavoured to produce an influence upon the mind of Dionysius by the conversation of Plato. But the <figure id="fig.01272">
<head orig="Plato. (Bust at Florence.)">Plato. (Bust at Florence.)</head>
</figure> attempt failed, and had nearly cost the philosopher his life. Dionysius was highly incensed at the result of an argument in which he was worsted by Plato, who took occasion also to advance in the course of it some unpalatable truths; and in the first heat of his passion he would have punished the hardihood of the philosopher with death, had not Dio and Aristomenes together restrained him from it. They conceived, therefore, that Plato could no longer stay at Syracuse without hazard, and accordingly secured passage for him in a ship which was about to carry home Polis, a Lacedaemonian ambassador, or, according to Olympiodorus, a merchant of Aegina. Dionysius heard of it, and bribed Polis to sell him as a slave. He was accordingly sold by the treacherous Polis on the island of Aegina, which was then involved in war with Athens. According to some writers he was sold by the Aeginetans. A certain Anniceris, from Cyrené, ransomed him for twenty or thirty minae. Plato's friends and scholars (according to some, Dio alone) collected this sum in order to indemnify Anniceris, who, however, was so noble-minded that with the money he purchased a garden in the Academé, and presented it to the philosopher. When Plato had completed his travels, and had reached the end of his various dangers and calamities, he returned to Athens, and began publicly to teach philosophy in the Academy. He had inherited here a garden, which was purchased for five hundred drachmae. This garden remained the property of the philosophic school that he had founded. His memory was honoured by the Athenians and by foreigners with monuments and statues. Diogenes states that Plato taught philosophy first in the Academy, and also in a garden at Colonus. His Academy soon became celebrated, and was numerously attended by high-born and noble young men; for he had already, by means of his travels, and probably by some publications, acquired a distinguished name. Among these disciples, from whom he exacted no fee, were his nephew Speusippus, Xenocrates of Chalcedon, Aristotle, Heraclides of Pontus, Hestiaeus of Perinthus, and Philippus the Opuntian, while others, who were not regularly enrolled among his immediate followers, numbered such men as Iphicrates, Timotheus, Phocion, Lycurgus, Hyperides, Isocrates, and possibly Demosthenes ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 1. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>De Orat.</title>i. 20</bibl><bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 89" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. De Orat., 89</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Plato taught in the Academy for twenty-two years prior to his second journey to Syracuse, which he undertook at the instigation of Dio , who hoped, by the lessons of the philosopher, to influence the character of the new ruler of Syracuse. This prince, it is said, had been brought up by his father wholly destitute of an enlightened education, 
<pb n="1273" /><cb /> and it was now the task of Plato to form his mind by philosophy. It seems, at the same time, to have been the plan of Dio and Plato to bring about, by philosophical instruction, a wholesome reform of the Sicilian constitution, by giving it a more aristocratic character. But, whatever may have been their intentions, they were all frustrated by the weak and voluptuous character of Dionysius. Dio became the object of the tyrant's suspicion, and was conveyed away to the coast of Italy, without, however, forfeiting his possessions. In this condition of affairs, Plato did not long remain in Syracuse, where his position would at best have been ambiguous. He returned to Athens, but, in consequence of some fresh disagreement between Dionysius and Dio , with respect to the property of the latter, he was induced to take a third journey to Syracuse. The reconciliation, which it was his object to effect, completely miscarried; he himself came to an open rupture with Dionysius, and only obtained a free departure from Sicily through the active interposition of his Pythagorean friends at Tarentum. It does not appear that he took any part in the later conduct of Sicilian affairs, though his nephew and disciple Speusippus and others of the Academy, rendered personal assistance to Dio , in a warlike expedition against Dionysius. From this time Plato seems to have passed his old age in tranquillity in his garden, near the Academy, engaged with the instruction of numerous disciples, and the prosecution of his literary labours. He died while yet actively employed about his philosophical studies, in B.C. 347.</p>
 <p>The philosophical writings of Plato have come down to us complete, and have always been admired as a model of the union of artistic perfection with philosophical acuteness and depth. They are in the form of dialogue; but Plato was not the first writer who employed this style of composition for philosophical instruction. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdialogus">Dialogus</ref>.) Zeno the Eleatic had already written in the form of question and answer. Alexamenus the Teian and Sophron in the mimes had treated ethical subjects in the same form. Xenophon, Aeschines, Antisthenes, Euclides, and other Socratics had also made use of the dialogical form; but Plato has handled this form not only with greater mastery than any one who preceded him, but, in all probability, with the distinct intention of keeping by this very means true to the admonition of Socrates, not to communicate instruction, but to lead to the spontaneous discovery of it. Moreover, the dramatic form gives great force and liveliness to the teaching, and was used by Plato with so much ability as to lead to the grouping of the dialogues into trilogies and tetralogies as though they had been actual dramas. The dialogues of Plato are closely connected with one another, and various arrangements of them have been proposed. Schleiermacher divides them into three series or classes. In the first he considers that the germs of dialectic and of the doctrine of ideas begin to unfold themselves in all the freshness of youthful inspiration; in the second those germs develop themselves further by means of dialectic investigations respecting the difference between common and philosophical acquaintance with things, respecting notion and knowledge (<foreign lang="greek">δόξα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>); in the third they receive their completion by means of an objectively scientific working out, with the separation of ethics and physics. The first series embraces, according to <cb /> Schleiermacher, the <title>Phaedrus, Lysis, Protagoras, Laches, Charmides, Euthyphron</title>, and <title>Parmenides;</title> to which may be added as an appendix the <title>Apologia, Crito, Ion, Hippias Minor, Hipparchus, Minos</title>, and <title>Alcibiades II.</title> The second series contains the <title>Gorgias, Theaetetus, Meno, Euthydemus, Cratylus, Sophistes, Politicus, Symposium, Phaedo</title>, and <title>Philebus;</title> to which may be added as an appendix the <title>Theages, Erastae, Alcibiades I., Menexenus, Hippias Major</title>, and <title>Clitophon.</title> The third series comprises the <title>Republic, Timaeus, Critias</title>, and the <title>Laws.</title> This arrangement may be accepted as a matter of convenience, but scholars long ago ceased to think it possible to discover in the dialogues any satisfactory evidence of the order of their composition. The genuineness of many of the dialogues has been questioned, and the following are undoubtedly spurious: <title>Alcibiades II., Axiochus, Clitophon, Demadocus, Epinomis, Erastae, Eryxias, Hipparchus, De Iust., Minos, Sisyphus, Theages, De Virtute.</title> The following are probably spurious: <title>Hippias Minor, Alcibiades I., Menexenus.</title> The <title>Letters</title> are perhaps forgeries. (See Gudeman in <title>Classical Studies in Honour of Henry Drisler</title>, pp. 61-66 [New York, 1894].) The following are cited by Aristotle as having been written by Plato: <title>Republic, Timaeus, Laws, Phaedrus, Symposium, Gorgias, Meno, Hippias I.;</title> but obviously his silence as to the rest proves nothing.</p>
 <p>It is impossible within any reasonable limits to give a satisfactory account of the Platonic philosophy. His attempt to combine poetry and philosophy (the two fundamental tendencies of the Greek mind) gives to the Platonic dialogues a charm which irresistibly attracts us, though we may have but a deficient comprehension of their subject matter. Plato, like Socrates, was penetrated with the idea that wisdom is the attribute of the Godhead; that philosophy, springing from the impulse <hi rend="italic">to know</hi>, is the necessity of the intellectual man, and the greatest of the blessings which he possesses. When once we strive after Wisdom with the intensity of a lover, she becomes the true consecration and purification of the soul, adapted to lead us from the night-like to the true day. An approach to wisdom, however, presupposes an original communion with Being, truly so called; and this communion again presupposes the divine nature or immortality of the soul, and the impulse to become like the Eternal. This impulse is the love which generates in Truth, and the development of it is termed Dialectics. Out of the philosophical impulse which is developed by Dialectics, not only correct knowledge, but also correct action, springs forth. Socrates's doctrine respecting the unity of virtue, and that it consists in true, vigorous, and practical knowledge, is intended to be set forth in a preliminary manner in the <title>Protagoras</title> and the smaller dialogues attached to it. They are designed, therefore, to introduce a foundation for ethics by the refutation of the common views that were entertained of morals and of virtue; for although not even the words “ethics” and “physics” occur in Plato, and even dialectics are not treated of as a distinct and separate province, yet he must rightly be regarded as the originator of the threefold division of philosophy, inasmuch as he had before him the decided object to develop the Socratic method into a scientific system of dialectics, that should supply the grounds of our knowledge as well as of our moral action (physics and ethics),

 and therefore he separates the general investigations on knowledge and understanding, at least relatively, from those which refer to physics and ethics. Accordingly, the <title>Theaetetus, Sophistes, Parmenides</title>, and <title>Cratylus</title> are principally dialectical; the <title>Protagoras, Gorgias, Politicus, Philebus</title>, and the <title>Politics</title> principally ethical; while the <title>Timaeus</title> is exclusively physical. Plato's dialectics and ethics, however, have been more successful than his physics. Plato's doctrine of <seg lang="la">ideas</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἰδέαι</foreign>) was one of the most prominent parts of his system. He maintained that the existence of things, cognizable only by means of conception, is their true essence, their <seg lang="la">idea.</seg> Hence he asserts that to deny the reality of ideas is to destroy all scientific research. He departed from the original meaning of the word idea (namely, that of form or figure), inasmuch as he understood by it the unities (<foreign lang="greek">ἑνάδες, μονάδες</foreign>) which lie at the basis of the visible, the changeable, and which can only be reached by pure thinking. He included under the expression “idea” every thing stable amid the changes of mere phenomena, all really existing and unchangeable definitudes, by which the changes of things and our knowledge of them are conditioned, such as the ideas of genus and species, the laws and ends of nature, as also the principles of cognition and of moral action, and the essences of individual, concrete, thinking souls. His system of ethics was founded upon his dialectics, as is remarked above. Hence he asserted that, not being in a condition to grasp the idea of the good with full distinctness, we are able to approximate to it only so far as we elevate the power of thinking to its original purity.</p>
 <p>The best MS. of the greater part of Plato is the Codex Clarkianus, secured in Patmos by Daniel Clarke, an Englishman, and now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford). It dates from A.D. 896, and does not include the <title>Republic</title>, of which the best copy is a Paris codex (Codex Parisinus A) of the eleventh century.</p>

His treachery was discovered, and he was immediately put to death, 203. His daughter Plautilla was banished first to Sicily, and subsequently to Lipara, where she was treated with the greatest harshness.

 <head><surname full="yes">Plautus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">T. Maccius</foreName>
 <p>The most celebrated comic poet of Rome. He was a native of Sarsina, a small village in Umbria. He used to be called M. Accius Plautus, but his real name, as Ritschl has shown, was T. Maccius Plautus. The date of his birth is uncertain, but it may be placed about B.C. 254. He probably came to Rome at an early age, since he displays so perfect a mastery of the Latin language, and an acquaintance with Greek literature which he could hardly have acquired in a provincial town. Whether he ever obtained the Roman franchise is doubtful. When he arrived at Rome he was in needy circumstances, and was first employed in the service of the actors. With the money he had saved in this inferior station he set himself up in business, but failed; he then returned to Rome, and his necessities obliged him to enter the service of a baker, who employed him in turning a hand-mill. While in this degrading occupation he wrote three plays, the sale of which to the managers of the public games enabled him to quit his drudgery and begin his literary career. He was then probably about thirty years of age (224), and therefore commenced writing comedies a few years before the breaking out of the Second Punic War. He continued his literary occupation for about forty years, and died in 184, when he was seventy years of age. His contemporaries at first were Livius Andronicus and Naevius, afterward Ennius and Caecilius: Terence did not rise into notice till almost twenty years after his death. During the long time that he held possession of the stage, he was always a great favourite of the people; and he expressed a bold consciousness of his own powers in the epitaph which he wrote for his tomb, and which has come down to us: <lb />“Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, comoedia luget <lb />Scena deserta, dein risus, ludus iocusque <lb />Et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt.”</p>
 <p>Plautus wrote a great number of comedies, and in the last century of the Republic there were 130 plays which bore his name. Most of these, however, were not considered genuine by the best Roman critics. There were several works written upon the subject; and of these the most celebrated was the treatise of Varro, entitled <title>Quaestiones Plautinae.</title> Varro limited the undoubted comedies of the poet to twenty-one, which were hence called the <title>Fabulae Varronianae.</title> These Varronian comedies are the same as those which have come down to our own time, with the loss of one. At present we possess only twenty comedies of Plautus; but there were originally twenty-one in the manuscripts, and the <title>Vidularia</title>, which was the twentyfirst, and which came last in the collection, was torn off from the manuscript in the Middle Ages. The titles of the twenty-one Varronian plays are: (1) <title>Amphitruo</title>,</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Asinaria</title>,</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Aulularia</title>,</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Captivi</title>,</p>
 <p>(5) <title>Curculio</title>,</p>
 <p>(6) <title>Casina</title>,</p>
 <p>(7) <title>Cistellaria</title>,</p>
 <p>(8) <title>Epidicus</title>,</p>
 <p>(9) <title>Bacchides</title>,</p>
 <p>(10) <title>Mostellaria</title>,</p>
 <p>(11) <title>Menaechmi</title>,</p>
 <p>(12) <title>Miles</title>,</p>
 <p>(13) <title>Mercator</title>,</p>
 <p>(14) <title>Pseudolus</title>,</p>
 <p>(15) <title>Poenulus</title>,</p>
 <p>(16) <title>Persa</title>,</p>
 <p>(17) <title>Rudens</title>,</p>
 <p>(18) <title>Stichus</title>,</p>
 <p>(19) <title>Trinummus</title>, (20) <title>Truculentus</title>, (21) <title>Vidularia.</title> This is the order in which they occur in the manuscripts, though probably not the one in which they were originally arranged by Varro. The present order is evidently alphabetical; the initial letter of the title <cb /> of each play is alone regarded, and no attention is paid to those which follow: hence we find <title>Captivi, Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria: Mostellaria, Menaechmi, Miles, Mercator: Pseudolus, Poenulus, Persa.</title> The play of the <title>Bacchides</title> forms the only exception to the alphabetical order. It was probably placed after the <title>Epidicus</title> by some copyist, because he had observed that Plautus, in the <title>Bacchides</title> (ii. 2, 36), referred to the <title>Epidicus</title> as an earlier work. The names of the comedies are either taken from some leading character in the play, or from some circumstance which occurs in it: those titles ending in -<hi rend="italic">aria</hi> are adjectives, giving a general description of the play: thus <title>Asinaria</title> is the “Ass-Comedy.”</p>
 <p>The comedies of Plautus enjoyed unrivalled popularity among the Romans, and continued to be represented down to the time of Diocletian. The continued popularity of Plautus through so many centuries was owing, in a great measure, to his being a national poet. Though he founds his plays upon Greek models, the characters in them act, speak, and joke like genuine Romans, and he thereby secured the sympathy of his audience more completely than Terence could ever have done. Whether Plautus borrowed the plan of all his plays from Greek models, it is impossible to say. The <title>Cistellaria, Bacchides, Poenulus</title>, and <title>Stichus</title> were taken from Menander, the <title>Casina</title> and <title>Rudens</title> from Diphilus, and the <title>Mercator</title> and the <title>Trinummus</title> from Philemon, and many others were undoubtedly founded upon Greek originals. But in all cases Plautus allowed himself much greater liberty than Terence; and in some instances he appears to have simply taken the leading idea of the play from the Greek, and to have filled it up in his own fashion. It has been inferred from a well-known line of Horace (<title>Epist.</title> ii. 1. 58), <title>Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi</title>, that Plautus took great pains to imitate Epicharmus. But there is no correspondence between any of the existing plays of Plautus and the known titles of the comedies of Epicharmus; and the verb <seg lang="la">properare</seg> probably has reference only to the liveliness and energy of Plautus's style, in which he bore a resemblance to the Sicilian poet. It was, however, not only with the common people that Plautus was a favourite; educated Romans read and admired his works down to the latest times. Cicero (<title>De Off.</title> i. 29) places his wit on a par with that of the old Attic comedy, and St. Jerome used to console himself with the perusal of the poet after spending many nights in tears on account of his past sins. The favourable opinion which the ancients entertained of the merits of Plautus has been confirmed by the judgment of the best modern critics, and by the fact that several of his plays have been imitated by many of the best modern poets. Thus the <title>Amphitruo</title> has been imitated by Molière and Dryden, the <title>Aulularia</title> by Molière in his <title>Avare</title>, the <title>Mostellaria</title> by Regnard, Addison, and others, the <title>Menaechmi</title> by Shakespeare in his <title>Comedy of Errors</title>, the <title>Trinummus</title> by Lessing in his <title>Schatz</title>, and so with others. Horace (<title>A. P.</title> 270), indeed, expresses a less favourable opinion of Plautus; but it must be recollected that the taste of Horace had been formed by a different school of literature, and that he undervalued the ancient poets of his country. Moreover, it is probable that the censure of Horace does not refer to the general character of Plautus's poetry, but merely to his inharmonious verses and to some of his jests. Plautus performed an important 
<pb n="1276" /><cb /> work in the enrichment of the Latin language. His genius for coining words was very remarkable, and in after-years the majority of his new terms were taken into the literary language by Cicero, who gave them the stamp of his authority. In this respect he stands out as a unique and important figure, and one whose influence has been too little recognized. See Peck's <title>History of the Latin Language</title>, pt. iii.; Besta, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Verborum Compositione Plaut.</title> (Breslau, 1876)</bibl>; Ulrich, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Composita bei Plautus</title> (Halle, 1884)</bibl>; Georke, <title>Vocabula Graeca</title> in <bibl default="NO"><title>Linguam Lat. Recepta</title> (Königsberg, 1868)</bibl>; and Rassow in <title>Jahn's Jahrbücher</title>, Suppl. xv. 589.</p>
 <p>The MSS. of Plautus that are of especial importance are the Codex Ambrosianus (A) at Milan (a palimpsest) of the fourth or fifth century; the Codex Palatinus (B), now at Rome; the Codex Decurtatus (C) at Heidelberg; the Codex Vaticanus or Vetus (D); and the Codex Britannicus (J) in the British Museum. The last four are of about the eleventh or twelfth century, and represent a single archetype. No MS. contains all the plays.</p>
 <p>The text of Plautus has come down to us in a very corrupt state. It contains many lacunae and interpolations.

 <p> A part of the population of Rome, which derived its origin mainly from the conquered Latins settled on Roman territory by the kings Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Martius. At first these possessed only the passive rights of citizenship, being excluded from all its privileges as well as from service in war, and forming a community sharply separated from the old citizens, the patricians. In particular, they did not possess the right of concluding valid marriages with patricians, although they were otherwise equal in matters of private law. When, by the constitution of Servius Tullius, they were compelled to serve in war and to pay war-taxes, they obtained the right of voting with the patricians in the Comitia Centuriata. After the establishment of the Republic in B.C. 510, the plebeians began the struggle with the patricians, who were then in sole possession of the secular and priestly offices. The aim of the plebeians was to secure complete equality of rights, answering to their equality of duties. An important engine in this struggle was the tribunate of the people (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstribunus">Tribuni Plebis</ref>) established in 491, as well as the Comitia Tributa. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.) The plebeians had the chief weight in that assembly, and after B.C. 448 it was invested with the right of passing decrees binding on the whole people. Among their first acquisitions was the right of entering into valid marriages with the patricians (B.C. 445). One after another, the plebeians gained admittance to the most important offices of State and the priesthoods, down to the year 300, so that only insignificant offices remained reserved for the patricians. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspatricii">Patricii</ref>.) When the struggle of the orders was thus settled, the opposition between patricians and plebeians lost its practical importance. The two orders were completely blended together, and the place of the aristocracy of birth was taken by the aristocracy of office, the members of which were called <seg lang="la">nobiles</seg> (q. v.). From this time the name <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> passed to the lower ranks of the people, as contrasted with this nobler class.

The eldest and most beautiful, Maia, became the mother of Hermes by Zeus; Electra and Taÿgeté, of Dardanus and Lacedaemon by the same; Alcyoné, of Hyrieus by Poseidon; Celaeno, of Lycus and Nycteus by the same; Steropé or Asteropé, of Oenomaüs by Ares; Meropé (i. e. “the mortal”), of Glaucus by Sisyphus. Out of grief, either for the fate of Atlas or for the death of their sisters, they killed themselves and were placed among the constellations. According to another legend, they were pursued for five years by the giant hunter <ref type="cross" target="crossorion">Orion</ref> (q.v.), until Zeus turned the distressed nymphs and their pursuer into neighbouring stars. As the constellation of the seven stars, they made known by their rising (in the middle of May) the approach of harvest, and by their setting (at the end of October) the time for the new sowing. 
<pb n="1277" /><cb /> Their rising and setting were also looked upon as the sign of the opening and closing of the sailing season. One of the seven stars is invisible; this was explained to be Meropé, who hid herself out of shame at her marriage with a mortal. The constellation of the Pleiades seems also to have been compared to a flight of doves (<foreign lang="greek">πελειάδες</foreign>). Hence the Pleiades were supposed to be meant in the story told by Homer of the ambrosia brought to Zeus by the doves, one of which is always lost at the Planctae Rocks, but is regularly replaced by a new one ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 12. 62" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xii. 62</bibl>). Among the Romans, the constellation was called Vergiliae, the stars of spring. As being the daughters of Atlas, the name Atlantides is often used of them.

<head orig="Plinius">Plinius</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Plinius Secundus</hi>, called the Elder. A Roman representative of encyclopaedic learning, born A.D. 23, at Novum Comum (Como), in Upper Italy. Although throughout his life he was almost uninterruptedly occupied in the service of the State, yet at the same time he carried on the most widely extended scientific studies to which he laboriously devoted all his leisure hours, and thus gained for himself the reputation of the most learned man of his age. Under Claudius he served as commander of a troop of cavalry (<seg lang="la">praefectus alae</seg>) in Germany; under Vespasian, with whom he was in the highest favour, he held several times the office of imperial governor in the provinces, and superintended the imperial finances in Italy. Finally, under Titus, he was in command <cb /> of the fleet stationed at Misenum, when in A.D. 79, at the celebrated eruption of Vesuvius, his zeal for research led him to his death. For a detailed account of this event, as well as of his literary labours, we have to thank his nephew, the Younger Pliny (<title>Epist.</title> iii. 5; vi. 16).</p>
 <p>Besides writings upon military, grammatical, rhetorical, and biographical subjects, he composed two greater historical works—a history of the Germanic wars in twenty books, and a history of his own time in thirty-one books. His last work was the Natural History (<title>Historia Naturalis</title>), in thirtyseven books, which has been preserved to us. This was dedicated to Titus, and was published in A.D. 77; but he was indefatigably engaged in amplifying it up to the time of his death. This encyclopaedia is compiled from 20,000 notices, which he had extracted from about 2000 writings by 474 authors. Book i. gives a list of contents and the names of the authors used; ii. is on astronomy and physics; iii.-vi., a general sketch of geography and ethnography, mainly a list of names; vii.-xix., natural history proper (vii., anthropology; viii.-xi., zoölogy of land and water animals, birds, and insects; xii.-xix., botany); xx.-xxxii., the pharmacology of the vegetable kingdom (xx.-xxvii.) and of the animal kingdom (xxviii.-xxxii.); xxxiii.xxxvii., mineralogy and the use of minerals in medicine and in painting, sculpture, and the engraving of gems, besides valuable notices upon the history of art. A kind of comparative geography forms the conclusion.</p>
 <p>Considering the extent and varied character of the undertaking, the haste with which the work was done, the defective technical knowledge and small critical ability of the author, it cannot be surprising that it includes a large number of mistakes and misunderstandings, and that its contents are of very unequal value, details that are strange and wonderful, rather than really important, having often unduly attracted the writer's attention. Nevertheless, the work is a mine of inestimable value in the information it gives us respecting the science and art of the ancient world; and it is also a splendid monument of human industry. Even the unevenness of the style is explained by the mosaic-like character of the work. At one time it is dry and bald in expression; at another, rhetorically coloured and impassioned, especially in the carefully elaborated introductions to the several books. On account of its bulk, the work was in early times epitomized for more convenient use. An epitome of the geographical part of Pliny 's encyclopaedia, belonging to the time of Hadrian, and enlarged by additions from Pomponius Mela and other authors, forms the foundation of the works of Solinus and Martianus Capella. Similarly the <title>Medicina Plinii</title> is an epitome prepared in the fourth century for the use of travellers.</p>
 <p>About two hundred manuscripts of Pliny are in existence, divided into two general classes—the <seg lang="la">vetustiores</seg>, all more or less incomplete, but truer to the original, and the <seg lang="la">recentiores</seg>, which are less fragmentary, but also less accurate. Of the former the best is the Codex Bambergensis of the tenth century, containing only bks. xxxii.-xxxvii. The <seg lang="la">recentiores</seg> are all of the same “family,” going back to a single archetype now lost.

 </p>
 <p>(2) Called the Younger, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus</hi>, nephew and adopted son of the elder Pliny , born A.D. 62, at Novum Comum. After the early death of his father Caecilius, he was carefully brought up by his mother Plinia and by his adoptive father. He was trained in rhetoric under Quintilian, and began his public career as an advocate in the nineteenth year of his age. After serving in Syria as military tribune, he devoted himself under Domitian to the service of the State, and became the emperor's quaestor, and also a tribune of the people and praetor (A.D. 93). Under Trajan, he held the consulship in 100, and about 112 governed the province of Bithynia as imperial legate. He died about 114, very widely respected on account of his mild and benevolent character, his exemplary private life, his ability as an orator, his refined taste, and his services to letters. He was distinguished by the favour of the emperor, and was in friendly intercourse with the most celebrated men of his time and the representatives of literature. Among his friends appear Quintilian (<title>Epist.</title> ii. 14. 9), Silius Italicus (iii. 7), Martial (iii. 21), Suetonius (i. 8; iii. 8; v. 10; ix. 34), and, above all, Tacitus (i. 6, 20; iv. 13; vi. 6, 16, 20; vii. 20, 33; viii. 7; ix. 10, 14), to whom he was bound by the most genuine mutual attraction.</p>
 <p>Of his poems and forensic speeches, which he published himself, nothing has been preserved, with the exception of a panegyric addressed to Trajan, which he pronounced in the Senate in A.D. 100 in order to thank the emperor for the consulship conferred upon him. This he afterwards published in a revised form. It is composed in an affected and artificial style, and is full of the most exaggerated pieces of flattery addressed to the emperor; it served as a pattern for the later panegyrists. Besides this, we possess a collection of letters in nine books, dating from the year 97-108, edited by himself. To this collection there is added a tenth book, consisting of the official correspondence between him and Trajan, belonging chiefly to the time of his Bithynian governorship, published, we may presume, after his death. (The best-known letters in this book are that on the punishment of the Christians, No. 97, and the emperor's reply, No. 98.) His letters, in which he happily imitates Cicero, give a clear picture of his own personality, his studies, and his intercourse with his friends, as well as of the public, social, and literary life of his time, and are therefore valuable as authorities for the history of the same.</p>
 <p>The only existing manuscript which contains all the nine books of Pliny is the Codex Laurentinus (Mediceus) of the ninth or tenth century, from which several others are derived. A very <cb /> old manuscript, now lost, gave its readings to the editio Aldina of 1508.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> (eight books only) appeared at Venice in 1471. The first complete edition is that of Aldus <bibl default="NO">(Venice, 1508)</bibl>. Other editions are those of Gruter <bibl default="NO">(1611)</bibl>; Veenhusen, with notes <bibl default="NO">(Leyden, 1669)</bibl>; Döring <bibl default="NO">(Freiburg, 1843)</bibl>; Waltz <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1833)</bibl>; of bk. iii. with English notes by Mayor <bibl default="NO">(London, 1880)</bibl>; of bks. i. and ii. by Cowan <bibl default="NO">(London, 1889)</bibl>.

<head orig="Plotīnus">Plotinus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλωτῖνος</foreign>). A Greek philosopher, born A.D. 205 at Lycopolis, in Egypt. In the twentyeighth year of his life he applied himself to philosophy, and attended the lectures of the most celebrated men of that time in Alexandria. But none of these was able to satisfy him, until in Ammonius Saccas, the founder of Neo-Platonism, he discovered the teacher whom he had sought. With him he stayed for eleven years; then, in 243, he joined the expedition of the emperor Gordian against the Persians, in order to learn the Persian philosophy. In this object he failed, owing to the unsuccessful issue of the undertaking; he was even obliged to flee for his life to In 244 he went to Rome, where he worked till 269 with great success, and gained the emperor Gallienus himself and his wife Salonina as converts to his teaching, so that he even dared to conceive the idea of founding an ideal city in Campania, with the approval and support of the emperor: this city was to be called Platonopolis, and its inhabitants were to live according to the laws of Plato. Gallienus was not disinclined to enter into the plan; but it was thwarted by the opposition of the imperial counsellors.</p>
 <p>Plotinus died in 270, on the estate of a friend in Campania. With the fiftieth year of his age he had begun to reduce his teaching to a written form; the fifty-four treatises, which have been preserved to us, were published after his death by his pupil and biographer Porphyry, who revised their style and arranged them in order. They were published in six <title>Enneads</title>, or sets of nine books. Plotinus was the first to give a systematic development to the Neo-Platonic doctrine, or, at least, the first to put it forth in writing, not indeed with the charm of the Platonic dialogues, 
<pb n="1279" /><cb />
 still less with their dialectic force, but nevertheless with depth of thought and in pithy, though at times careless and incorrect, language. It is true that there appears even in him a mystical tendency, especially in his doctrine of the ecstatic elevation of the soul to the divine being, to which he himself (according to the testimony of Porphyry) attained on four occasions; but he is still completely free from the fantastic and superstitious character of the later Neo-Platonism. See the works by Kirchner <bibl default="NO">(1854)</bibl>; Brenning <bibl default="NO">(1864)</bibl>; and Kleist <bibl default="NO">(1884)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossplutarchus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Plutarchus">Plutarchus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλούταρχος</foreign>). A Greek writer of biographies and miscellaneous works, who was born at Chaeronea, in Boeotia, about A.D. 50. He came of a distinguished and wealthy family, and enjoyed a careful education. His philosophical training he received at Athens, especially in the school of the Peripatetic Ammonius (of Lamptrae in Attica), who is identified with Ammonius the Egyptian. After this he made several journeys, and stayed a considerable time in Rome, where he gave public lectures on philosophy, was in friendly intercourse with persons of distinction, and conducted the education of the future emperor Hadrian. From Trajan he received consular rank, and by Hadrian he was in his old age named procurator of Greece. He died about 120 in his native town, in which he held the office of archon and of priest of the Pythian Apollo.</p>
 <p>His fame as an author is founded principally upon his <title>Parallel Lives</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Βίοι Παράλληλοι</foreign>). These he probably prepared in Rome under the reign of Trajan, but completed and published late in life at Chaeronea. The biographies are divided into connected pairs, each pair (which makes a <foreign lang="greek">βιβλίον</foreign>) placing a Greek and a Roman in juxtaposition, and generally ending with a comparative view of the two; of these we still possess forty-six: Theseus and Romulus; Lycurgus and Numa; Solon and Valerius Publicola; Themistocles and Camillus; Pericles and Fabius Maximus; Alcibiades and Coriolanus; Timoleon and <cb /> Aemilius Paulus; Pelopidas and Marcellus; Aristides and the elder Cato ; Philopoemen and Flamininus; Pyrrhus and Marius; Lysander and Sulla ; Cimon and Lucullus; Nicias and Crassus; Eumenes and Sertorius; Agesilaus and Pompeius; Alexander and Caesar; Phocion and the younger Cato ; Agis and Cleomenes and the two Gracchi; Demosthenes and Cicero; Demetrius Poliorcetes and Antonius; Dion and Brutus. To these are added the four specially elaborated lives of Artaxerxes Mnemon, Aratus, Galba, and Otho; a number of other biographies are lost. The sequels which follow most of the lives give a sort of balanced judgment (<foreign lang="greek">σύγκρισις</foreign>) of the two men compared.</p>
 <p>Plutarch's object was not to write history, but out of more or less important single traits to form distinct sketches of character. The sketches show, indeed, a certain uniformity, inasmuch as Plutarch has a propensity to portray the persons represented either as models of virtue in general, or as slaves of some passion in particular; but the lives are throughout attractive, owing to the liveliness and warmth of the portraiture, the moral earnestness with which they are penetrated, and the enthusiasm which they display for everything noble and great. For these reasons they have always had a wide circle of readers. More than this, their historical value is not to be meanly estimated, in spite of the lack of criticism in the use of the authorities and the manifold inaccuracies and mistakes, which, in the Roman lives, were in part the result of a defective knowledge of the Latin language. There are a large number of valuable pieces of information in which they fill up numerous gaps in the historical narratives that have been handed down to us. Besides this work eightythree writings of various kinds (some of them only fragments and epitomes of larger treatises) are preserved under the name of Plutarch. These are improperly classed together under the title <title>Moralia</title> (ethical writings); for this designation is only applicable to a part of them. The form of these works is as diverse as their tenor and scope: some are treatises and reports of discourses; a large number is composed in the form of Platonic or Aristotelian dialogues; others again are learned collections and notices put together without any special plan of arrangement. A considerable portion of them are of disputable authenticity or have been proved to be spurious. About half are of philosophical and ethical tenor, and have for the most part a popular and practical tendency, some of them being of great value for the history of philosophy, such as the work on the opinions of the philosophers (<title>De Placitis Philosophorum</title>) in five books. Others belong to the domain of religion and worship, such as the works <title>On Isis and Osiris, On the Oracles of the Pythian Priestess</title>, and <title>On the Decay of the Oracles;</title> others to that of the natural sciences, while others again are treatises on history and antiquities, or on the history of literature, such as the <title>Greek and Roman Questions</title> and the <title>Lives of the Ten Orators.</title> This last is undoubtedly spurious. One of the most instructive and entertaining of all his works is the <title>Table-talk (Quaestiones Conviviales)</title> in nine books, which deal <seg lang="la">inter alia</seg> with a series of questions of history, archaeology, mythology, and physics. But even with these works his literary productiveness was not exhausted; for, besides these, twenty-four lost 
<pb n="1280" /><cb />
 writings are known to us by their titles and by fragments. In his language he aims at attaining the pure Attic style, without, however, being able altogether to avoid the deviations from that standard which were generally prevalent in his time.</p>
 <p>The entire works of Plutarch are edited by Reiske <bibl default="NO">(12 vols. 1774-79)</bibl>; and in the Didot Collection, by Dübner-Döhner <bibl default="NO">(5 vols. 1846-55)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosspolemon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Polĕmon">Polemon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολέμον</foreign>). (1) I. A king of Pontus and the Bosporus. He was the son of Zenon, the orator of Laodicea. As a reward for the services rendered by his father as well as himself, he was appointed by Antony in B.C. 39 to the government of a part of China; and he subsequently obtained in exchange the kingdom of Pontus. He accompanied Antony in his expedition against the Parthians in 36. After the battle of Actium he was able to make his peace with Octavian, who confirmed him in his kingdom. About the year 16 he was intrusted by Agrippa with the charge of reducing the kingdom of Bosporus, of which he was made king after conquering the country. His reign after this was long and prosperous; he extended his dominions as far as the river Tanaïs; but having engaged in an expedition against the barbarian tribe of the Aspurgians, he was not only defeated by them, but taken prisoner, and put to death. By his second wife Pythodoris, who succeeded him on the throne, he left two sons, Polemon II., and Zenon, king of Armenia, and one daughter, who was married to Cotys, king of Thrace.</p>
 <p>(2) II. Son of the preceding and of Pythodoris. He was raised to the sovereignty of Pontus and Bosporus by Caligula in A.D. 39. Bosporus was afterwards taken from him by Claudius, who assigned it to Mithridates, while he gave Polemon a portion of Cilicia in its stead, 41. In 62 Polemon was induced by Nero to abdicate the throne, and Pontus was reduced to the condition of a Roman province.</p>
 <p>(3) Of Athens, an eminent Platonic philosopher. He was the son of Philostratus, a man of wealth and political distinction. In his youth, Polemon was extremely profligate; but one day, when he was about thirty, on his bursting into the school of Xenocrates at the head of a band of revellers, his attention was so arrested by the discourse, which chanced to be upon temperance, that he tore off his garland and remained an attentive listener, and from that day he adopted an abstemious course of life, and continued to frequent the school, of which, on the death of Xenocrates, he became the head, B.C. 315. He died in 273 at a great age. He esteemed the object of philosophy to be, to exercise men in things and deeds, not in dialectic speculation. He placed the <seg lang="la">summum bonum</seg> in living according to the laws of nature.

Towards the end of his life he was a martyr to the gout, and accordingly put an end to his life in his fifty-sixth year by causing himself to be buried alive in the tomb of his ancestors at Laodicea. His fame was founded principally on the pithiness and adroitness of his improvisations. There are preserved two declamations by him, artificial variations upon the same theme—funeral orations in honour of Cynaegirus and Callimachus, the generals who fell at Marathon.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πολιτεία</foreign>). Citizenship, a citizen (<foreign lang="greek">πολίτης</foreign>) being defined by Aristotle as one who is a sharer in the legislative and judicial power (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοχος κρίσεως καὶ ἀρχῆς</foreign>). The character and meaning of citizenship differed in the various States of Greece, and in each State was not always the same. In the Homeric Age the notion of citizenship existed only so far as the condition of slaves and aliens was its negative. In the historical period there was a grand levelling up of the lower ranks, owing to (1) the overthrow of the monarchy,</p>
 <p>(2) the quarrels of the nobles who succeeded to the power of the kings, and</p>
 <p>(3) the growth of commerce and of wealth. Among the chief rights of a Greek <foreign lang="greek">πολίτης</foreign>, and which were sometimes granted to <foreign lang="greek">πρόξενοι</foreign> or closely allied aliens, were the right of intermarriage (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιγαμία</foreign>), the right of acquiring landed property (<foreign lang="greek">ἔκτησις</foreign>), immunity from taxation (<foreign lang="greek">ἀτέλεια</foreign>). These privileges were included under the general name of <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοτέλεια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοπολιτεία</foreign>, and 
<pb n="1282" /><cb />
 the non-citizens who obtained them were called <foreign lang="greek">ἰσοτελεῖς</foreign>. The Greeks regarded the State (<foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>) as a definite entity intended to effect some one great end, as liberty (under a democracy), wealth (under an oligarchy), and education and training (under an aristocracy). This unity of purpose was most fully carried out in Sparta, where the one great aim of all the political institutions was to unite and solidify the governing body against the superior numbers of a subject population. (See Helotes; <ref type="cross" target="crosssparta">Sparta</ref>.) But in all the Greek governments the object was to draw the social bond as close as possible.

<div2 id="crosspolitianus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Politiānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Angĕlus</foreName>
 <p>, the Latinized name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Angelo de' Ambrogini</hi>, of Monte Puliciano, usually known in English as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Politian</hi>, a distinguished Italian humanist of the fifteenth century. He was born at Monte Puliciano, in Tuscany, July 14, 1454, the son of a well-known jurist. At the age of ten he was sent to Florence, at that time the centre of the Renaissance movement, and pursued his studies under some of the most famous scholars of the day, among them the Greeks Argyropoulos and Callistus and the two great Italian teachers Landino and Ficino. As a student, Politianus evinced powers of an uncommon nature, especially in the classic languages. His brilliant epigrams in Greek and Latin, written in his sixteenth year, were universally admired and wondered at. When seventeen, he began the translation into Latin hexameters of the <title>Iliad</title>, carrying it as far as the fifth book, the first book having been already translated by another scholar. So great was his success in this rather audacious attempt that he won the notice and the favour of Lorenzo de' Medici, then supreme at Florence, who became the patron of the precocious boy then popularly known as “the Homeric youth.” Aided alike by the patronage of Lorenzo and his own genius, he soon attained to the first place among the scholars of Italy. In 1484 he was made Professor of Greek and Latin in the University of Florence, whither his increasing fame drew students from all parts of Europe, among them Grocyn, Reuchlin, and Linacre, to whom England and Germany are so greatly indebted. Politian died in 1494, two years after the death of his patron, and during the temporary supremacy of Savonarola. He is buried in the Church of San Marco, Florence, and an inscription on his tomb styles him “an angel with one head and three tongues.”</p>
 <p>The original works of Politian in Latin fill a closely printed quarto, and consist of letters and miscellaneous papers in both prose and verse. His Latin style, while not of classical purity, is intensely individual, and shows that he used the language not as an imitator, but as a master. He likewise deserves an honourable distinction for the service rendered to his mother tongue, in which he wrote the first secular drama (<title>Orfeo</title>) that Italian literature has to show. Besides his translations of Homer mentioned above, he also made versions of Epictetus, Galen, Hippocrates, Herodian, of Plato's <title>Charmides</title>, and especially of Callimachus, besides editing the <title>Pandecta</title> of Justinian with such acuteness as to impress even modern students of the Roman law. His <seg lang="la">praefationes</seg> to Homer, Quintilian, Suetonius, and to the <cb /> <title>Silvae</title> of Statius, as well as his <title>Praelectio in Persium</title>, also deserve mention.</p>
 <p>The complete works of Politian were published at Florence in 1499, and at Lyons, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1536-46)</bibl>. On his personality, see <bibl default="NO">Roscoe, <title>Life of Lorenzo de' Medici</title> (1796)</bibl>; Symonds, <title>The Renaissance in Italy</title>, vol. ii. pp. 345-355 <bibl default="NO">(1877)</bibl>; Von Reumont, <title>Lorenzo de' Medici</title>, vol. ii. <bibl default="NO">(Eng. trans. 1876)</bibl>; and Voigt, <title>Die Wiederbelebung des klass.

In the Civil Wars he fought on Caesar's side at Pharsalus and in Africa and Spain. After the murder of Caesar he at first inclined to the republicans, but in B.C. 43 joined Antony, and on the breaking up of the Triumvirate obtained Gallia Transpadana for his province. In the redistribution of lands there he saved the poet Vergil's paternal estate for him. After negotiating the Peace of Brundisium between Antony and Octavianus, B.C. 41, he became consul in 40, conquered the Parthini in Dalmatia in 39, and celebrated a triumph. He then retired from political life, and devoted himself to the advancement of learning. He served the cause of literature not only by his own writings, but by setting up the first public library at Rome, and by introducing the custom of reading new works aloud to a circle of experts before publication. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrecitationes">Recitatio</ref>.) He was himself a stern critic of others, as we see by his strictures on Cicero, Sallust, and Livy , though it was remarked that he was not always so severe upon himself. He was especially celebrated as an orator; yet his speeches, in spite of careful preparation, were devoid of elegance, and, as Quintilian remarks, might be supposed to have been written a century earlier than Cicero's. He wrote tragedies also, in which the same stiffness and dryness are complained of. He likewise composed a history of the Civil Wars in seventeen books, from the First Triumvirate to the battle of Philippi, which seems not to have been published in a complete form till after his death. Not one of his 
<pb n="1283" /><cb />
 works has survived. The history of Caesar's African campaign, <title>Bellum Africanum</title>, has sometimes been attributed to him, but on insufficient grounds. He died in his eightieth year (A.D. 4). Three letters of his to Cicero are found among the Ciceronian collection, <title>Ad Familiares</title> (x. 31-33). Fragments of his history of the Civil Wars can be seen in St. Peter's <title>Historicorum Fragmenta</title>, 262.

 <p>A Roman knight and a friend of Augustus. He was by birth a freedman, and has obtained a place in history on account of his riches and his cruelty. He was accustomed to feed his lampreys with human flesh, and whenever a slave displeased him, the unfortunate wretch was forthwith thrown into the pond as food for the fish. On one occasion Augustus was supping with him, when a slave had the misfortune to break a crystal goblet, and his master immediately ordered him to be thrown to the fishes. The slave fell at the feet of Augustus, praying for mercy; and when the emperor could not prevail upon Pollio to pardon him, he dismissed the slave as an act of imperial power, and commanded all Pollio's crystal goblets to be broken and the fish-pond to be filled up. Pollio died B.C. 15, leaving a large part of his property to Augustus. It was this Pollio, who built the celebrated villa of <ref type="cross" target="crosspausilypum">Pausilypum</ref> (q.v.) near Naples.

<div2 id="crosspolybius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Polybius">Polybius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολύβιος</foreign>). (1) One of the most important Greek historians, born about B.C. 204 at Megalopolis; the son of Lycortas, general of the Achaean League in 185-184 and after 183. Through his father, and his father's friend Philopoemen, he early acquired a deep insight into military and political affairs, and was afterwards intrusted with high federal offices, such as the commandership of the cavalry, the highest position next to the federal generalship. In this capacity he directed his efforts towards maintaining the independence of the Achaean League. As the chief representative of the policy of neutrality during the war of the Romans against Perseus of Macedonia, he attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and was one of the 1000 noble Achaeans who in 166 were transported to Rome as hostages, and detained there for seventeen years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, he was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror in the Macedonian War, who intrusted him with the education of his sons, Fabius and the younger Scipio. He was on terms of the most cordial friendship with the latter, whose counsellor he became. Through Scipio's intercession in 150, Polybius obtained leave to return to his home with those of the Achaeans who still survived; but in the very next year he went with his friend to Africa, and was present at the capture of Carthage, B.C. 146. After the destruction of Corinth in the same year, he returned to his native land, and made use of his credit with the Romans to lighten, as far as he could, the lot of his unfortunate countrymen. When Greece was converted into a Roman province, he was intrusted with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek towns, and in this office gained for himself the highest recognition both from the conquerors and from the conquered, the latter rewarding his services by setting up statues to him and by other marks of honour (Polyb. <title>Epitome</title>, xl. 10; Pausan. viii. 9, 30, 37, 44, 48). The pedestal of such a statue has been discovered at Olympia. The succeeding years he seems to have spent in Rome, engaged on the completion of his historical work, and occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the interest of his history, more particularly with a view to obtaining actual ocular knowledge of historical sites. After the death of his patron he returned to Greece, and died in 122, at the age of eighty-two, in consequence of a fall from his horse.</p>
 <p>During his long sojourn in Rome, his study of the history and constitution of Rome, as well as his personal experiences, inspired him with the conviction that the Roman people owed the magnificent development of their power, not to fortune, but to their own fitness, and to the excellence of their political and military institutions, as compared with those of other States, and that therefore their rapid rise to world-wide dominion had been in some measure an historical necessity. In order to enlighten his countrymen on this point, and thereby to supply them with a certain consolation for their fate, he composed his history (<foreign lang="greek">Πραγματειά</foreign>) of the period between B.C. 220 and 146, in forty books. Of these the first two are in the form of an Introduction, and give a compendium of events in Italy, Africa, and Greece, from the destruction of Rome by the Gauls to the First Punic War, thus recording the rise of the Roman supremacy. 
<pb n="1284" /><cb /> The first main division (books iii.-xxx.) contained in synchronistic arrangement the occurrences from 220 to 168—that is, of the time in which Rome was founding its world-wide dominion through the Hannibalian, Macedonian, Syrian, and Spanish Wars. The second (books xxxi.-xl.) described the maintenance and consolidation of this dominion against the attempts to overthrow it in the years 168-146. Of this work only books i.-v. have been preserved in a complete form; of the rest we possess merely fragments and epitomes. This is especially to be regretted in those parts in which Polybius narrates events which came within his own experience. He is the first representative of that particular type of historical composition, which does not merely recount the several facts and phenomena in chronological order, but goes back to the causes of events, and sets forth their results. His work rests upon a knowledge of the art of war and of politics, such as few ancient historians possessed; upon a careful examination of tradition, conducted with keen criticism; partly also upon what he had himself seen, and upon the communications of eye-witnesses and actors in the events. It sets forth the course of occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgment, and love of truth, and, among the circumstances affecting the result, lays especial stress on the geographical conditions. It belongs, therefore, to the greatest productions of ancient historical writing, though, in respect to language and style, it does not attain the standard of Attic prose. The language is often wanting in purity, and the style is stiff and inharmonious.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολύκαρπος</foreign>). One of the Apostolic Fathers, was a native of Smyrna. The date of his birth and of his martyrdom are uncertain. He is said to have been a disciple of the Apostle John, and to have been consecrated by this apostle bishop of the church at Smyrna. It has been conjectured that he was the angel of the church of Smyrna to whom Jesus Christ directed the letter in the Apocalypse (ii. 8-11); and it is certain that he was Bishop of Smyrna at the time when Ignatius of Antioch passed through that city on his way to suffer death at Rome, some time between 107 and 116. Ignatius seems to have enjoyed much <cb /> this intercourse with Polycarp, whom he had known in former days, when they were both hearers of the Apostle John. The martyrdom of Polycarp occurred in the persecution under the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. As he was led to death the proconsul offered him his life, if he would revile Christ. “Eighty and six years have I served him,” was the reply, “and he never did me wrong: how then can I revile my King and my Saviour?” We have remaining only one short piece of Polycarp, his <title>Letter to the Philippians</title>, which is published along with Iguatius and the other apostolical writers.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολυκλῆς</foreign>). The name of two artists. The elder Polycles was probably an Athenian, and flourished about B.C. 370. He appears to have been one of the artists of the later Athenian school, who obtained great celebrity by the sensual charms exhibited in their works. One of his chief works was a celebrated statue of an Hermaphrodite. The younger Polycles is placed by Pliny in B.C. 155, and is said to have made a statue of Juno, which was placed in the portico of Octavia at Rome, when that portico was erected by Metellus Macedonicus. But since most of the works of art with which Metellus decorated his portico were not the original productions of living artists, but the works of former masters, it has been conjectured that this Polycles may be no other than the Athenian artist already mentioned.

<head orig="Polyclītus">Polyclitus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολύκλειτος</foreign>). (1) Next to his somewhat older contemporary Phidias, the most admired sculptor of antiquity. He was a native of Argos, and, like Phidias, a pupil of Ageladas. His name marks an epoch in the development of Greek art, owing to his having laid down rules of universal application with regard to the proportions of the human body in its mean standard of height, age, etc. In close accordance with these rules he fashioned a typical figure, the “Doryphorus,” a powerful youth with a spear in his hand: this figure was called the <foreign lang="greek">κανών</foreign>, and for a long time served as a standard for succeeding artists (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 55</bibl>). The rules which he practically applied in the canon he also set forth theoretically in a written work (Galen, in Overbeck's <title>Schriftquellen</title>. 958, 959). It is also said of him that when he made statues in an attitude of rest, instead of dividing the weight of the body equally between the two feet, according to the custom which had hitherto prevailed, he introduced the practice of causing them to rest upon one foot, with the other foot slightly raised, whereby the impression of graceful ease and calm repose was for the first time fully produced (Pliny , l. c. 56). Except the celebrated chryselephantine colossal statue of <ref type="cross" target="crosshere">Heré</ref> (q.v.), which he made for the temple of the goddess at Argos (Pausan. ii. 17. 4), when it was rebuilt after a fire in B.C. 423, he produced statues in bronze alone, and almost exclusively of men in the prime of youth, such as the “Doryphorus” already mentioned; the “Diadumenus,” a

 youth of softer lineaments, who is tying a band round his head (Pliny , l. c. 55; Lucian, <title>Philopseudes</title>, 18); and an “Amazon,” which was preferred even to that of Phidias (Pliny , l. c. 53). These statues may still be identified in copies of a later time. He also worked as an architect. The theatre at Epidaurus (of which considerable remains still exist), the circular structure called the Tholos, and the temple of Asclepius (Pausan. ii. 27), are now generally assigned to the younger Polyclitus.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Polyclītus the Younger</hi>, a pupil of the Argive sculptor Naucydes. Among his works was a statue of the athlete Agenor (Pausan. vi. 6. 2), and of Zeus Philios at Megalopolis, in which the god was represented with some of the attributes of Dionysus (id. viii. 31. 4). The statues of Zeus Meilichios at Argos (id. ii. 20. 1), and those of Apollo, Leto, and Artemis on Mount Lyconé near Argos (ib. 24. 5), may possibly be assigned to the elder Polyclitus (Overbeck, <title>Schriftquellen</title>. 941-943).

 <p>(2) Of Scotussa in Thessaly, son of Nicias, conquered in the Pancratium at the Olympic Games in Ol. 93, B.C. 408. His size was immense, and the most marvellous stories are related of his strength, how he killed without arms a huge and fierce lion on <cb /> Mount Olympus, and how he stopped a chariot at full gallop. His reputation led the Persian king, Darius Ochus, to invite him to his court, where he performed similar feats (Pausan. vi. 5, 4; vii. 27, 6).</p>
 <p>(3) Of Pharsalus in Thessaly. He was intrusted by his fellow-citizens, about B.C. 375, with the supreme government of their native town. He afterward entered into a treaty with Iason of Pherae.

 <p>(2) Youngest son of Priam and of Laothoë; his father's favourite son. He was killed while yet a boy by Achilles. The tragedians make him the son of Priam and Hecuba, who, before the fall of Troy, committed him with many treasures to the care of their guest-friend, the Thracian king Polymestor (or Polymnestor). After the capture of Troy, Polymestor put the boy to death, in order to get possession of the gold, and threw the body into the sea. The waves cast it up on the Trojan shore, and here Hecuba found it, just as Polyxena was on the point of being sacrificed. Out of revenge she, with the help of the captive Trojan woman, killed the two children of the murderer and blinded Polymestor himself. According to another version, Ilioné, Priam's daughter and Polymestor's wife, brought up the brother, who had been committed to her charge, as her own son, while she gave up her child Deïphilus (or Deïpilus) instead of Polydorus. The Greeks, who wished to exterminate the race of Priam, won over Polymestor by promising him the hand of Electra and a large present of money in return for the murder of Polydorus. Polymestor then murdered his own son, and was blinded and killed by Ilioné.</p>

In B.C. 323 he was appointed by Alexander II. in command of the army of invalids and veterans, which Craterus had to conduct home to Macedonia. He afterwards served under Antipater in Europe, and so great was the confidence which the latter reposed in him, that Antipater on his death-bed (319) appointed Polysperchon to succeed him as regent and guardian of the king, while he assigned to his own son Cassander the subordinate station of Chiliarch. Polysperchon soon became involved in war with Cassander, who was dissatisfied with this arrangement. It was in the course of this war that Polysperchon basely surrendered Phocion to the Athenians, in the hope of securing the adherence of Athens. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossphocion">Phocion</ref>.) Although Polysperchon was supported by Olympias, and possessed great influence with the Macedonian soldiers, he proved no match for Cassander, and was obliged to yield to him the possession of Macedonia about 316. For the next few years Polysperchon is rarely mentioned, but in 310, he again assumed an important part by reviving the long-forgotten pretensions of Heracles, the son of Alexander and Barsiné, to the throne of Macedonia. Cassander marched against him, but distrusting the fidelity of his own troops, he entered into secret negotiations with Polysperchon, and persuaded the latter, by promises and flatteries, to murder Heracles ( <bibl n="Diod.  20. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xx. 28</bibl>).

This space was marked off by stones, and in respect to the auspices formed the limit between city and country. (See Livy, i. 44, and Cicero, <title>Nat. D.</title> ii. 11, with the note of J. B.

 <p>The old Pomerium remained unchanged until the time of Sulla ; after him it was again extended by Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, and Titus, and probably also by Augustus, Trajan, and Aurelian.

<head orig="Pompeii">Pompeii</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πομπήϊοι</foreign>). A city in Campania, founded towards the sixth century B.C. by an Italic tribe, which left its native haunts in the Apennines to seek a happier home on the shores of Campania. They settled on a hill of volcanic origin between the river Sarno and the sea, and divided the land so that each <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> should have a share of two <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> (57,600 square feet). The number of settlers is estimated by Fiorelli at 150 families. The city was inaugurated with the same political and religious rites which had been observed in the foundation of Rome; it was crossed by two main streets, the <seg lang="la">cardo</seg> running from south to north, the <seg lang="la">decumanus</seg> running from east to west. Two lanes parallel, one with the <seg lang="la">cardo</seg>, one with the <seg lang="la">decumanus</seg>, were added in course of time, by means of which the city was finally divided into nine quarters or wards (<seg lang="la">regiones</seg>), and each ward subdivided into blocks (<seg lang="la">insulae</seg>). The same division is maintained to-day. Thus the house of Lucius Popidius Secundus is marked house n. v., fourth insula, first region; that of Marius Epidius Rufus is n. xx., first insula, ninth region, and so on.</p>
 <p>Towards B.C. 424 the city fell a prey to the Samnites. The new-comers, under the influence of Hellenic art and civilization, transformed the smoky huts of the conquered tribesmen into gay and commodious dwellings, levelled and paved the streets, and raised public and sacred edifices in the choicest forms of Doric architecture.

 <p>Towards the end of the Marsic War the Pompeians were defeated in the plains of Nola; their city and their territory were given up to a colony of veterans; the name was changed into that of Colonia Veneria Cornelia Pompeii. Under the benevolent rule of Augustus, Pompeii became the Newport of ancient Rome, and continued to enjoy the favour of the rich and pleasure-seeking patricians for more than a century.

</figure> February 5th, the <seg lang="la">felix</seg> Campania was shaken by an earthquake. Pompeii, Nuceria, Herculaneum, and Naples were seriously damaged; a flock of six hundred sheep disappeared in a fissure of the earth; statues fell from their pedestals; public edifices collapsed, and when the work of repairing the damages was nearly completed, and the recollections of the earthquake had almost died away, another by far more horrible catastrophe took place by which Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabia, as living cities, were wiped forever from the face of the earth.</p>
 <p>The account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 is given by Pliny the Younger in two well-known letters (vi. 16 and 20) to Tacitus. Other particulars are supplied by Dio Cassius, lxvi. 21; Suetonius, <title>Titus</title>, viii; Marcus Aurelius, <cb /> iv. 48; and Tertullian, <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 40." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>40.</bibl>The history of those eventful days has therefore been reconstructed in all the leading details. (See Dyer's chapter “History of Vesuvius,” pp. 10-29.) Still there are a great many others, revealed by late excavations, which are less known to the general public. Thus, for instance, the year in which the eruption took place is well known (A.D. 79); not so the month and the day, as the text of Pliny which mentions them is undoubtedly corrupt. The Neapolitan scholars have favoured autumn (November) rather than summer (August), alleging the discoveries of carpets drawn over the mosaic and marble floors, of braziers placed in exposed corners, of dried figs and grapes, of chestnuts, pine-nuts, and other fruit belonging to the late autumn. On the other hand, it was alleged that in the hundred and fifty houses excavated since 1870, no carpet has been found, only a piece of matting which, however, seems to have been rolled, and not extended on the floor; that the braziers collected both from Pompeii and Herculaneum number scarcely fifty, and that they were used not for warming but for cooking purposes; and lastly that in Southern climates the fruit mentioned above ripens in</p>
 <p>The controversy about the precise date of the destruction of Pompeii was settled on October 11th, 1889. While excavating a bed of volcanic ashes, a few steps outside the Porta Stabiana, Signor Ruggero discovered and moulded in plaster two human forms, and that of a trunk of a tree, 3.40 metres long, 0.40 m. in diameter. One of the human casts belonged to a middle-aged man clothed in an overcoat, and lying on his back with drawn-up legs, and arms outstretched, as if trying to protect his chest from the shower of burning ashes by which he was suffocated. The other belongs to an old woman suffocated and buried while attempting to raise herself from the ground by the joint action of hands and knees. By far more important is the cast of the trunk of the tree. The tree was still in its upright position, and must have been twenty-five or thirty feet high. The lower portion, embedded in pumice-stone, does not appear in the mould; the top also has disappeared, because, projecting above the bed of ashes, it must have been burned or cut away. The middle section of the trunk is wonderfully well preserved, together with many leaves and berries. Trunk, leaves, and berries belong undoubtedly to a species of <title>Laurus Nobilis</title>, the fruit of which comes to maturity towards the end of autumn. Prof. Pasquale, in a paper published in the <title>Notizie degli Scavi</title> for 1889, p. 408, proves that the berries discovered on October 11th were perfectly ripe. This Laurus Nobilis, therefore, so ingeniously brought back to life after a lapse of one thousand eight hundred and ten years, settles the controversy concerning 
<pb n="1289" /><cb /> the date of the eruption: it took place in the month of November, on November 23, A.D. 79. The catastrophe took the gay and thoughtless people by surprise. All over the town we find evidence of a sudden panic—of a wild rush for life. The writer has often noticed one of these striking examples in a corner of the Forum opposite to the temple of Iupiter. Some masons were engaged in raising an enclosure round a new altar of white marble; the mortar just dashed against the side of the wall was but half spread out; one can see the long sliding stroke of the trowel about to return and obliterate its own track; but it never did return: the hand of the workman was suddenly arrested. The city was not buried entirely, and concealed from the eyes of survivors. The top of the walls of private buildings, the colonnades of public edifices emerged from the dreary waste, so that it was easy for the survivors to dig out the valuables left behind, and even the statues, marbles, fountains, and bronzes. Later eruptions and the work of nature and man obliterated the last traces of the city; a vague recollection of its site survived in the name of <title>Cività</title>, given to the hill in which it lay buried. The peasants of the Cività have searched for hidden treasure since time immemorial; to save the trouble and expense of an open excavation they tunnelled the bed of lapilli and scoriae, sometimes paying for their imprudence with their life. The skeletons of four men buried alive by the collapse of the <seg lang="la">cuniculus</seg> they were actually digging have been found in a house near the Via dell' Abbondanza. That of Papidius Priscus was searched likewise in the Byzantine period, as proved by the <cb /> words <title>Dumnos Pertusa</title> scratched above a hole cut through one of its walls to obtain a passage from room to room. The house of L. Caecilius Iucundus was found ransacked; its searching-party had left in one of the holes a lantern of the shape still in use among the Neapolitan peasantry. Yet there are a great many exceptions to the rule. Many wealthy houses have never been explored, and their valuable contents fall occasionally our prey, under the form of a treasure-trove. The writer remembers one which took place in 1881. While Michele Ruggero was excavating half-way between the Porta Stabiana and the coast, a building was found—perhaps a bathing establishment—comprising some twenty rooms gayly decorated with frescoes. Here a band of thirty-six Pompeians took refuge from the fury of the eruption, hoping to take to the boats; the fury of the sea, however, deprived the fugitives of their last chance of salvation. They were all buried alive; their skeletons were found mingled together, as they fell in their last struggle for a breath of air. They were wealthy people. Together with their bones the following objects lay scattered on the floor: five bracelets, six pairs of earrings, two necklaces, one chain, one brooch, seventeen finger-rings, fourteen pieces of gold, two hundred and eight of silver, besides engraved stones, pearls, mirrors, cameos, and copper coins.</p>
 <p>In the following year (1882, October) a Lararium, or domestic chapel, was found in a house of the Via dell' Abbondanza in a wonderful state of preservation. On the steps of the altar there were seven statuettes of delicate workmanship. One had been taken away at the moment of the catastrophe by the fugitives, 
<pb n="1290" /><cb /> perhaps because it was the best or the most venerated of the group. The six others were found in their proper places. One represents Apollo Citharoedus, the figure being of bronze, the accessories of silver. The second, made of bronze, silver, and ivory, has undergone a curious transformation. At first it was made to represent Mercury, then, with the addition of proper clothing and attributes, it was turned into an Aesculapius. The others represent Mercury, Hercules, and two Lares.</p>
 <p>On September 20, 1888, another remarkable discovery of silver-plate and other valuables took place in regio viii. insula ii. house xxiii. It seems that the owners of the house, having made a bundle of their plate, had put it on a stool, waiting, perhaps, for a lull in the shower of burning ashes <figure id="fig.01290">
<head orig="View of Pompeii. Island of Revigliano (Petra Herculis). Present line of coast. Ancient line of shore.">View of Pompeii. Island of Revigliano (Petra Herculis). Present line of coast. Ancient line of shore.</head>
</figure> in order to remove it to a safer place. However, in the hurry of flight, the bundle was left behind. Besides pieces of the stool on which it was laid, and of the coarse cloth in which it was enveloped, an exquisite silver set for four was found—viz., four large and four small cups and saucers, four egg-cups, one filter, and one jug, weighing nine pounds in all. There was also broken silverware and table-utensils, such as spoons, salt-cellars, etc. More important still was the discovery of three <seg lang="la">libelli</seg> (of wood coated with wax) containing family documents. The deeds, drawn up in A.D. 61, eighteen years before the eruption, belonged to two women—a Decidia Margaris and a Poppaea Noté. In the first deed Poppaea sells to Margaris two young slaves named Simplex and <cb /> Petrinus. In the second she declares herself a debtor to Margaris for the sum of 1450 sestertii. The third document cannot be interpreted with certainty.</p>
 <p>The question whether Pompeii was a sea-port town in the strict sense of the word, or whether it was separated from the sea by a strip of land more or less broad, has been fully discussed by Michele Ruggero in the volume published on the eighteenth centenary of the destruction of the ill-fated town. He declares the story of the discovery of a large three-masted ship (believed to be the flag-ship of Pliny ) near the farm of Messigna, in 1833, to be devoid of foundation, because the would-be masts, seen by the naval engineer Giuseppe Negri, were but trunks of cypresses. Many such trees have been found since 1833: they are planted in quincunx, with the roots in the ancient vegetable soil, and the trunks buried in pumice-stone of the fatal eruption of 79. The average size of one hundred trees, measured by Palmieri and Scacchi, was 1.42 m. in circumference, 0.47 m. in diameter, which is the average size of cypresses thirty-six years old. Following the line of trees and of antique farmhouses, Ruggero was able to trace the line of the sea-coast before the eruption. It starts from Torre Annunziata, bends inland between the Salerno railway and the high-load to Castellamare, and crosses the river Sarno near the “molino di Rosa.” The island of Revigliano, the <title>petra Herculis</title> of the Pompeians, which, before the eruption, was separated from the mainland by a channel 1.550 metres wide, comes now within 420 m. of the shore. 
<pb n="1291" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The foregoing view, taken from the north end of the excavations, shows the belt of land created by the shower of ashes and lapilli between the walls of the city and the Petra Herculis.</p>
 <p>Of the inhabitants of Pompeii, whom Fiorelli puts down as about 12,000, the greater part fled on foot, on horseback, or in chariots. This is proved by the fact that, although the city contained many stables, two coaches only have been found—one in the court-yard of the house of Papidius Priscus and the other in the stables regio i. insula iv. n. 28. Eight skeletons of horses have been found in the space of eighteen years. In the same period of time 150 human bodies were discovered within the walls, the total number of victims being about 550, less than one in twelve. Many died in their own houses while waiting for the cessation of the shower of ashes; some were crushed by the fall of the roofs; some asphyxiated by the sulphuric vapours or by the fine dust; some starved to death or were buried alive in places from which there was no escape. The skeletons are generally found with a lamp close by, darkness, even in the day-time, having been dense; and they are seldom alone. The Pompeians died in family groups, as shown by the eighteen bodies discovered in the cellar of Diomede's villa; by the twelve in the atrium of house reg. i. ins. ii. n. 28. The fate of these last could not be explained at first, because it seemed so easy for them to have made an escape through the opening of the <seg lang="la">impluvium.</seg> On closer examination it was ascertained that a heavy iron grating had been laid across the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, and that the unfortunate crowd had tried to force it without success.</p>
 <p>Bodies crushed by falling ruins or buried in lapilli cannot be cast in plaster, being reduced to a shapeless heap of bones. Those buried in fine dust (hardened by water) are marvellously well preserved, and can be reproduced in plaster to perfection. Nothing is more impressive than the study of the various kinds of agonies suffered by these poor victims at the last moment of the struggle.</p>
 <p>The first cast belongs to a man dashed against the pavement by the fall of the wooden ceiling of his shop-room. His fingers are clenched and his elbows drawn, as if trying to lift the weight under which he had fallen. <figure /></p>
 <p>The following cast belongs to a workman of the Tanneries (Concia), who was left behind or forgotten by his comrades, as he was lying ill in bed. <figure /> <cb /> The poor wretch, whose legs and body appear emaciated, dragged himself as far as the courtyard of the establishment, and, perceiving no chance of deliverance or help, laid himself down to die quietly on the bare floor.</p>
 <p>Women also seem to have died with resignation; they are generally found lying on the left side, with the <seg lang="la">tunica</seg> drawn over the face, as a <figure /> shelter from the ashes. The attitude of most of the men conveys the idea of energetic despair. Far from showing the abandonment of death, they fight to the last against their fate, raising hands and knees in a supreme effort, as shown by the following casts. <figure /></p>
 <p>We must not forget the sad fate of a watch-dog, the casting of whose form is the most difficult and delicate yet accomplished in Pompeii, owing to the thinness of the legs and the extraordinary contortion of the body. The faithful animal was forgotten by his ungrateful master, L. Vesonius Prinius. He was left tied to a chain behind the street-door of the house, reg. vi. ins. xiv. n. 20. As the lapilli, pouring in from the door, began to fill the vestibule, the dog tried his best to break the ties. He was overtaken by death while lying on his back with outstretched legs. <figure id="fig.01291">

Professor Mau, of the German Institute, has been illustrating year by year the latest finds in this department, both in the <title>Bullettino</title> and the <title>Mittheilungen</title> of the German Institute.</p>
 <p>The frescoes of Pompeian houses afford the best illustration that could be desired of ancient mythology, but they offer little of historical interest. Their value, as works of art, has been slightly exaggerated; at all events, they cannot bear comparison with the frescoes discovered in Rome, in Livia's Palatine house, in Livia's villa <title>ad Gallinas albas</title> (Prima Porta), in the Roman palace by la Farnesina, in Lamia's gardens (the Nozze Aldobrandine), in Nero's Golden House, etc. Among the few Pompeian frescoes connected with history the one discovered in the autumn of 1882 between the Via dell' Abbondanza, dei Teatri, e de xii. Dei, representing the Judgment of Solomon, took everybody by surprise. Who would ever have conceived that a scene inspired by the Bible should have been discovered on the walls of this purely pagan, dissolute, materialistic town? The picture belongs to the burlesque genre; and although the caricaturist has somewhat exaggerated the conventional deformity of his personages, still every particular of the Biblical account can be recognized. King Solomon, with the sceptre in his hand, sits on a platform between two assessors. He has already told the officer to make two portions of the infant; and while the pretended mother is waiting to receive her half in perfect indifference, the real one falls in a fit of despair.</p>
 <p>Many conjectures have been proposed to explain the appearance of such a picture at Pompeii; the most satisfactory seems to be this: The Alexandrian School <cb /> — after the translation of the Bible by the LXX.—was well acquainted with Hebrew archaeology, history, and tradition. The episode of Solomon's judgment may have become popular in Alexandrian circles. At Pompeii a large contingent of Alexandrians met every summer. No wonder if one of them chose to decorate his house with frescoes derived from legends so popular in his mother country. What renders the conjecture all the more probable is that, in the same apartment, there are other frescoes representing Egyptian scenes, such as crocodile-hunting, the land of the pygmies, etc.</p>
 <p>A wine-shop was discovered in 1877, in regio vi. ins. xiv. n. 36, with several <seg lang="la">tableaux de genre</seg> painted on the white plastering of its walls. The first scene on the left represents a young man kissing a woman, who appears dressed in yellow garments with black shoes. She says, <hi rend="SmallCaps">nolo! cvm mvrtal</hi>—“I don't want to be kissed; go to your Myrtalis.” The second scene represents the same woman talking to Myrtalis. They both point their fingers at a third female, who brings in a great wine-jar and a cup, and says, <hi rend="SmallCaps">qvi volt svmat ˙ oceane veni bibe</hi>—an invitation to partake of the drink. The third scene represents two gamblers seated, with the chessboard on their knees, on which several <seg lang="la">latrunculi</seg> are disposed in lines of different colours— yellow, white, and black. The one on the left throws the dice, and says, <hi rend="SmallCaps">exsi</hi>—“I am out.” His partner, pointing to the dice, answers, <hi rend="SmallCaps">non tria ˙ dvas est</hi>—“You only made two points, not three!” Both fight in the fourth scene. One says, <hi rend="SmallCaps">non ita ˙ me tria ˙ ego fvi</hi>—“You lie; I made three points; I am out.” The other retorts, <hi rend="SmallCaps">orte fellator ˙ ego fvi</hi>—“You . . .! I have the game.” At this moment the shop-keeper interferes, and, pushing the rioters outside, says, <hi rend="SmallCaps">ite foras rixsatis</hi>—“Go out in the street if you want to fight.”</p>
 <p>Landscapes are an utter failure; there is no colouring, no perspective, no appreciation of nature, no value of tones. Still, the study of the works of Pompeian landscape-painters is not without interest. Prof. O. Comes has compiled from them a catalogue of flowers, shrubs, ornamental and fruittrees known to the Pompeians. It comprises seventy varieties. See Ruggero's <title>Pompei</title>, pp. 177-250.</p>
 <p>The name of Pompeii was never forgotten in the Middle Ages. A chronicler of the ninth century, named Martinus Monachus, speaks of Sikkartol, prince of Benevento, having pitched his tents in a spot <title>qui a Pompeia urbe Campaniae, nunc deserta, nomen accepit</title> (named from Pompeii, a city of Campania, now deserted). Martinus refers not to Pompeii destroyed in A.D. 79, but to a village of the same name mentioned by the Tabula Pentingeriana at the time of Theodosius, which had in its turn been destroyed by later eruptions.</p>
 <p>In 1594 Muzio Tuttavilla, Count of Sarno, while boring an underground channel to convey the waters of the Sarno itself to Torre dell' Annunziata, discovered remains of the amphitheatre, of the temple of Isis, of the Forum, of the <seg lang="it">strada delle Tombe</seg>, 
<pb n="1293" /><cb /> to which, however, no attention was paid. Two inscriptions, dug up in the heart of the city, contained the name of Pompeii, of one of its prominent citizens (M. Popidius), of one of its prominent goddesses (Venus Physica Pompeiana); they were thrown aside and probably made use of as building materials. Regular investigation began a century and a half later, on April 1, 1748. I say regular, because the search was undertaken by the State; but there was no order, no regularity, no system. Holes were dug at random, more for the sake of official plunder in favour of the Naples museums than for topographical discovery. The merit of having brought Pompeian excavations to their actual efficiency belongs to Giuseppe Fiorelli, who was named superintendent in 1860. To him we are indebted for a thoroughly scientific organization of the work; since to his ingenuity we owe the invention of the casting in plaster the corpses of the Pompeians who lost their lives in that appalling catastrophe.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Pompēius</hi>, said to have been the son of a flute-player, was the first of the family who rose to dignity in the State. He was consul in B.C. 141, when he carried on war against the Numantines in Spain. Having been defeated by the enemy in several engagements, he concluded a peace with them; but on the arrival of his successor in the command, he disowned the treaty, which was declared invalid by the Senate. He was censor in 131 with Q. Metellus Macedonicus ( <title>B. C.</title> vi. 76; <title>De Fin.</title> ii. 17, <bibl n="Cic. Off. 3. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Off.</title>iii. 30</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Pompēius Rufus</hi>, either son or grandson of the preceding, was a zealous supporter of the aristocratic party. He was tribune of the plebs B.C. 100, praetor 91, and consul 88, with L. Sulla. When Sulla set out for the East, to conduct the war against Mithridates, he left Italy in charge of Pompeius Rufus, and assigned to him the army of Cn. Pompeius Strabo, who was still engaged in carrying on war against the Marsi. Strabo, however, who was unwilling to be deprived of the command, caused Pompeius Rufus to be murdered by the soldiers ( <title>Pro Dom.</title> 31, <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 89" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Brut.</title>89</bibl>; <title>B. C.</title> i. 57).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Pompēius Rufus</hi>, son of No. 2, married Sulla 's daughter, and was murdered by the party of Sulpicius and Marius in the Forum during the consulship of his father, B.C. 88 ( <bibl n="Plut. Sull. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sull.</title>8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Pompēius Rufus</hi>, son of No. 3 and grandson of the dictator Sulla , was tribune of the plebs in B.C. 52, when he distinguished himself as the great partisan of the triumvir Pompey, whom he assisted to obtain the sole consulship. Rufus, however, on the expiration of his office, was accused of <seg lang="la">vis</seg>, was condemned, and went into exile at Bauli in Campania ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> viii. 1, 4; Dio Cass. xi. 45).</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Pompēius Rufus</hi>, praetor B.C. 63, was sent to Capua and Apulia during Catiline's conspiracy. In 61 he obtained the province of Africa, with the title of proconsul.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sex. Pompēius</hi>, married Lucilia, a sister of the poet C. Lucilius.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sex. Pompēius</hi>, elder son of No. 6, never obtained any of the higher offices of the State, but acquired great reputation as a man of learning, and is praised by Cicero for his accurate knowledge of jurisprudence, geometry, and the Stoic philosophy ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>47</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Brut. 175" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Brut., 175</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sex. Pompēius</hi>, a descendant of No. 7, consul with Sex. Apuleius A.D. 14, in which year the emperor Augustus died. He seems to have been a patron of literature. Ovid addressed him several letters during his exile

 <p>(9) Cn. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pompēius Strabo</hi>, younger son of No. 6, and father of the triumvir. He was quaestor in Sardinia, B.C. 103, praetor 94, and propraetor in Sicily in the following year. He was consul in 89, when he carried on war with success against the allies, subduing the greater number of the Italian people who were still in arms. Towards the end of the year he brought forward the law (<title>Lex Pompeia</title>) which gave to all the towns of the Transpadani the <title>ius Latii</title> or <title>Latinitas.</title> He continued in the south of Italy as proconsul in the following year (B.C. 88), and when Pompeius Rufus was appointed to succeed him in the command of the army Strabo caused him to be assassinated by the troops. Next year (87) the Marian party obtained the upper hand. Strabo was summoned by the aristocratic party to their assistance; and, though not active in their cause, he marched to the relief of the city, and fought a battle near the Colline Gate with Cinna and Sertorius (Vell. Pat. ii. 21). Shortly afterwards he was killed by lightning. His avarice and cruelty had made him hated by the soldiers to such a degree that they tore his corpse from the bier and dragged it through the streets. Cicero describes him ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 47" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Brut.</title>47</bibl>) “as worthy of hatred on account of his cruelty, avarice, and perfidy” (cf. <bibl n="Flor.  3. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.iii. 18</bibl>); but he possessed some reputation as an orator, and still more as a general.
 </p>
 <p>(10) Cn. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pompēius </hi>Magnus , the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Triumvir</hi>, son of No. 9, was born on the 30th of September, B.C. 106, in the consulship of Atilius Serranus and Servilius Caepio, and was consequently a few months younger than Cicero (who was born on the 3d of January in the same year) and six years older than Caesar. He fought under his father in 89 against the Italians, when he was only seventeen years of age, and continued with him till his death two years afterwards. For the next few years the Marian party had possession of Italy; and accordingly Pompey, who adhered to the aristocratic party, was obliged to keep in the background, and was only saved from an indictment by the intervention of Carbo. But when it became known, in 84, that Sulla was on the point of returning from Greece to Italy, Pompey hastened into Picenum, where he raised an army of three legions. Although only twenty-three years of age, Pompey displayed great military abilities in opposing the Marian generals by whom he was surrounded; and when he succeeded in joining Sulla in the course of the year (83) he was saluted by the latter with the title of Imperator.</p>
 <p>During the remainder of the war in Italy Pompey distinguished himself as one of the most successful of Sulla 's generals; and when the war in Italy was brought to a close, Sulla sent Pompey against the Marian party in Sicily and Africa. Pompey first proceeded to Sicily, of which he easily made himself master (82): here he put Carbo to death. In 81, Pompey crossed over to Africa, where he defeated Cn. Domitius Ahenorbarbus and the Numidian king Hiarbas, after a hard-fought battle. On his return to Rome in the same year, he was received with enthusiasm by the people, and was greeted by Sulla with the surname of <hi rend="SmallCaps" />Magnus , a name which he bore ever afterwards, and handed down to his children. Pompey, however, not satisfied with this distinction, sued for a triumph, which Sulla at first refused, but at length, overcome by Pompey's importunity, he allowed him to have his <cb /> own way. Accordingly, Pompey, who had not yet held any public office, and was still a simple <seg lang="la">eques</seg>, entered Rome in triumph in September, 81, and before he had completed his twenty-fifth year.</p>
 <p>Pompey continued faithful to the aristocracy after Sulla 's death (78), and supported the consul Catulus in resisting the attempts of his colleague Lepidus to repeal the laws of Sulla ; and when Lepidus had recourse to arms in the following year (77), Pompey took an active part in the war against him, and succeeded in driving him out of Italy. The aristocracy, however, now began to fear the young and successful general; but since Sertorius in Spain had for the last three years successfully opposed Metellus Pius, one of the ablest of Sulla 's generals, <figure id="fig.01294">
<head orig="Coin of Pompey.">Coin of Pompey.</head>
</figure> and it had become necessary to send the latter some effectual assistance, the Senate, with considerable reluctance, determined to send Pompey to Spain, with the title of proconsul, and with equal powers to Metellus. Pompey remained in Spain between five and six years (76-71); but neither he nor Metellus was able to gain any decisive advantage over Sertorius. But when Sertorius was treacherously murdered by his own officer Perperna in 82, the war was speedily brought to a close. Perperna was easily defeated by Pompey in the first battle, and the whole of Spain was subdued by the early part of the following year (71). Pompey then returned to Italy at the head of his army. In his march towards Rome he fell in with the remains of the army of Spartacus, which M. Crassus had previously defeated. Pompey cut to pieces these fugitives, and therefore claimed for himself, in addition to all his other exploits, the glory of finishing the Servile War.</p>
 <p>Pompey was now a candidate for the consulship; and although he was ineligible by law, inasmuch as he was absent from Rome, had not yet reached the legal age, and had not held any of the lower offices of the State, still his election was certain. His military glory had charmed the people; and as it was known that the aristocracy looked upon Pompey with jealousy, they ceased to regard him as belonging to this party, and hoped to obtain, through him, a restoration of the rights and privileges of which they had been deprived by Sulla. Pompey was accordingly elected consul, along with M. Crassus; and on the 31st of December, B.C. 71, he entered the city a second time in his triumphal car a simple knight.</p>
 <p>In his consulship (70), Pompey openly broke with the aristocracy, and became the great popular hero. He proposed and carried a law, restoring to the tribunes the power of which they had been deprived by Sulla. He also afforded his all-powerful aid to the Lex Aurelia, proposed by the praetor L. Aurelius Cotta, by which the <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> were to be taken in future from the Senate, knights, and tribunes of the treasury, instead of from the senators exclusively, as Sulla had ordained. In carrying both these measures Pompey was strongly supported by Caesar, with whom he was thus brought into close connection. 
<pb n="1295" /><cb /></p>
 <p>For the next two years (69 and 68) Pompey remained in Rome. In 67, the tribune A. Gabinius brought forward a bill, proposing to confer upon Pompey the command of the war against the pirates with extraordinary powers. This bill was opposed by the aristocracy with the utmost vehemence, but was notwithstanding carried. The pirates were at this time masters of the Mediterranean, and had not only plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, but had even made descents upon Italy itself. As soon as Pompey received the command, he began to make his preparations for the war, and completed them by the end of the winter. His plans were formed with great skill and judgment, and were crowned with complete success. In forty days he cleared the western sea of pirates, and restored communication between Spain, Africa, and Italy. He then followed the main body of the pirates to their strongholds on the coast of Cilicia; and after defeating their fleet, he induced a great part of them, by promises of pardon, to surrender to him. Many of these he settled at Soli, which was henceforward called Pompeiopolis. The second part of the campaign occupied only forty-nine days, and the whole war was brought to a conclusion in the course of three months; so that, to adopt the panegyric of Cicero (<title>Pro Leg. Man.</title> 12), “Pompey made his preparations for the war at the end of the winter, entered upon it at the commencement of spring, and finished it in the middle of the summer.” Pompey was employed during the remainder of this year and the beginning of the following in visiting the cities of Cilicia and Pamphylia, and providing for the government of the newly-conquered districts.</p>
 <p>During his absence from Rome, Pompey had been appointed to succeed Lucullus in the command of the war against Mithridates (66). The bill, conferring upon him this command, was proposed by the tribune C. Manilius, and was supported by Cicero, in an oration which has come down to us (<title>Pro Lege Manilia</title>). Like the Gabinian law, it was opposed by the whole body of the aristocracy, but was carried triumphantly. The power of Mithridates had been broken by the previous victories of Lucullus, and it was only left to Pompey to bring the war to a conclusion. On the approach of Pompey, Mithridates retreated towards Armenia, but he was defeated by the Roman general; and as Tigranes now refused to receive him into his dominions, Mithridates resolved to plunge into the heart of Colchis, and from thence make his way to his own dominions in the Cimmerian Bosporus. Pompey now turned his arms against Tigranes; but the Armenian king submitted to him without a contest, and was allowed to conclude a peace with the Republic. In 65 Pompey set out in pursuit of Mithridates, but he met with much opposition from the Iberians and Albanians; and after advancing as far as the river Phasis (Faz), he resolved to leave these savage districts. He accordingly retraced his steps, and spent the winter at Pontus, which he reduced to the form of a Roman province. In 64 he marched into Syria, deposed the king Antiochus Asiaticus, and made that country also a Roman province. In 63 he advanced farther south, in order to establish the Roman supremacy in Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, and Palestine. The Jews refused to submit to him, and shut the gates of Jerusalem against him, <cb /> and it was not till after a siege of three months that the city was taken. Pompey entered the Holy of Holies, the first time that any human being, except the high priest, had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot. It was during the war in Palestine that Pompey received intelligence of the death of Mithridates. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmithridates">Mithridates</ref> [6].) Pompey spent the next winter in Pontus; and after settling the affairs of Asia, he returned to Italy in 62. He disbanded his army almost immediately after landing at Brundisium, and thus calmed the apprehensions of many, who feared that, at the head of his victorious troops, he would seize upon the supreme power. He did not, however, return to Rome till the following year (51), and he entered the city in triumph on the 30th of September. He had just completed his forty-fifth year, and this was the third time that he had enjoyed the honour of a triumph.</p>
 <p>With this triumph the first and most glorious part of Pompey's life may be said to have ended. Hitherto his life had been an almost uninterrupted succession of military glory. But now he was called upon to play a prominent part in the civil commotions of the commonwealth, a part for which neither his natural talents nor his previous habits had in the least fitted him. It would seem that, on his return to Rome, Pompey hardly knew what part to take in the politics of the city. He had been appointed to the command against the pirates and Mithridates in opposition to the aristocracy, and they still regarded him with jealousy and distrust. At the same time, he was not disposed to unite himself to the popular party, which had risen into importance during his absence in the East, and over which Caesar possessed unbounded influence. The object, however, which engaged the immediate attention of Pompey was to obtain from the Senate a ratification for all his acts in Asia, and an assignment of lands which he had promised to his veterans. The Senate, however, glad of an opportunity to put an affront upon a man whom they both feared and hated, resolutely refused to sanction his measures in Asia. This was the unwisest thing the Senate could have done. If they had known their real interests, they would have sought to win Pompey over to their side, as a counterpoise to the growing and more dangerous influence of Caesar. But their shortsighted policy threw Pompey into Caesar's arms, and thus sealed the downfall of their party. Caesar promised to obtain for Pompey the ratification of his acts, and Pompey, on his part, agreed to support Caesar in all his measures. That they might be more sure of carrying their plans into execution, Caesar prevailed upon Pompey to become reconciled to Crassus, with whom he was at variance, but who, by his immense wealth, had great influence at Rome. The three agreed to assist one another against their mutual enemies, and thus was formed the so-called First Triumvirate. This union of the three most powerful men at Rome crushed the aristocracy for the time. Supported by Pompey and Crassus, Caesar was able in his consulship (59) to carry all his measures. Pompey's acts in Asia were ratified, and Caesar's agrarian law, which divided the rich Campanian land among the poorer citizens, enabled Pompey to fulfil the promises he had made to his veterans. In order to cement their union more closely, Caesar gave to Pompey his daughter Iulia in marriage. 
<pb n="1296" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Next year (58) Caesar went to his province in Gaul, but Pompey remained in Rome.</p>
 <p>While Caesar was gaining glory and influence in Gaul, Pompey was gradually losing the confidence of all parties at Rome. The Senate hated and feared him; the people had deserted him for their favourite Clodius, and he had no other resource left but to strengthen his connection with Caesar. Thus he came to be regarded as the second man in the State, and was obliged to abandon the proud position which he had occupied for so many years. According to an arrangement made with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus were consuls for a second time in 55. Pompey received as his provinces the two Spains, Crassus obtained Syria, while Caesar's government was prolonged for five years more—namely, from the 1st of January, 53, to the end of the year 49. At the end of his consulship Pompey did not go in person to his provinces, but sent his legates, L. Afranius and M. Petreius, to govern the Spains, while he himself remained in the neighbourhood of the city. His object now was to obtain the dictatorship, and to make himself the undisputed master of the Roman world. Caesar's increasing power and influence had at length made it clear to Pompey that a struggle must take place between them, sooner or later. The death of his wife Iulia in 54, to whom he was tenderly attached, broke the link which still connected him with Caesar, and the fall of Crassus in the following year (53), in the Parthian expedition, removed the only person who had the least chance of contesting the supremacy with them. In order to obtain the dictatorship, Pompey secretly encouraged the civil discord with which the State was torn asunder; and such frightful scenes of anarchy followed the death of Clodius at the beginning of 52 that the Senate had now no alternative but calling in the assistance of Pompey, who was accordingly made sole consul in 52, and succeeded in restoring order to the State. Soon afterwards Pompey became reconciled to the aristocracy, and was now regarded as their acknowledged head.</p>
 <p>The history of the Civil War which followed is related in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscaesar">Caesar</ref>. It is only necessary to mention here that after the battle of Pharsalia (48) Pompey sailed to Egypt, where he hoped to meet with a favourable reception, since he had been the means of restoring to his kingdom the father of the young Egyptian monarch. The ministers of the latter, however, dreading Caesar's anger if they received Pompey, and likewise Pompey's resentment if they forbade him to land, resolved to release themselves from their difficulties by putting him to death. They accordingly sent out a small boat, took Pompey on board, and rowed for the shore. His wife and friends watched him from the ship, anxious to see in what manner he would be received by the king, who was standing on the edge of the sea with his troops; but just as the boat reached the shore, and Pompey was in the act of rising from his seat in order to step on land, he was stabbed in the back by Septimius, who had formerly been one of his centurions, and was now in the service of the Egyptian monarch. Pompey was killed on the 29th of September, B.C. 48, and had just completed his fifty-eighth year. His head was cut off, and his body, which was thrown out naked on the shore, was buried by his freedman Philippus, who had accompanied him from the ship. The head was brought to Caesar <cb /> when he arrived in Egypt soon afterwards, but he turned away from the sight, shed tears at the melancholy death of his rival, and put his murderers to death. Pompey's untimely death excites pity; but no one who has well studied the state of parties at the close of the Roman commonwealth can regret his fall. There is abundant evidence to prove that, had Pompey's party gained the mastery, a proscription far more terrible than Sulla 's would have taken place, and Italy and the provinces have been divided as booty among a few profligate and unprincipled nobles. From such horrors the victory of Caesar saved the Roman world.

 <p>(11) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn. Pompēius </hi>Magnus , elder son of the triumvir by his third wife, Mucia. In the Civil War in 48 he commanded a squadron of the fleet in the Adriatic Sea. After his father's defeat at Pharsalia, he crossed over to Africa, and, after remaining there a short time, sailed to Spain in 47. In Spain he was joined by his brother Sextus and others of his party, who had fled from Africa after their defeat at Thapsus. Here the two brothers collected a powerful army, but were defeated by Caesar himself at the battle of Munda, fought on the 17th of March, 45. Cneius escaped from the field of battle, but was shortly afterwards taken prisoner and put to death.</p>
 <p>(12) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sextus Pompēius </hi>Magnus , younger son of the triumvir by his third wife, Mucia, was born B.C. 75. After the battle of Pharsalia he accompanied his father to Egypt, and witnessed his murder. On the defeat at Munda and the death of his brother, Sextus lived for a time in concealment in the country of the Lacetani, between the Iberus and the Pyrenees; but when Caesar quitted Spain he collected a body of troops and emerged from his lurking-place. In the civil wars which followed Caesar's death the power of Sextus increased. He obtained a large fleet, became master of the sea, and eventually took possession of Sicily. His fleet enabled him to stop all supplies of corn which were brought to Rome from Egypt and the eastern provinces, and such scarcity began to prevail in the city that the triumvirs were compelled by the popular discontent to make peace with Pompey. This peace was concluded at Misenum in 39, but the war was renewed in the following year. Octavian made great efforts to collect a large and powerful fleet, which he placed under the command of Agrippa. In 36 Pompey's fleet was defeated off Naulochus, with great loss. Pompey himself fled from Sicily to Lesbos and from Lesbos to Asia. Here he was taken prisoner by a body of Antony's troops, and carried to Miletus, where he was put to death (35) probably by command of Antony, though the latter sought to throw the responsibility of the deed upon his officers (Dio Cass. xiv. 9; xlviii. 17; xlix. 11).

He was the first to raise the hitherto improvised popular plays called <title>Atellanae</title> (q. v.) to a higher plane by the introduction of written composition in the metrical forms of the Greeks. He is particularly praised for richness of fancy, liveliness in plays upon words, and readiness in the use of rustic and farcical language (Vel. Pat. ii. 9. 6; Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.

 <p> (or <hi rend="bold">Pontīnae) Palūdes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ποντίναι Λίμναι</foreign>). The Pontine Marshes. The name of a low, marshy plain on the coast of Latium, between Circeii and Terracina, said to have been so called after an ancient town Pontia, which disappeared at an early period. The marshes are formed chiefly by a number of small streams, which, instead of finding their way into the sea, spread over this plain. The miasmas arising from these marshes are exceedingly unhealthful in the summer. At an early period they either did not exist at all or were confined to a narrow district. We are told that originally there were twenty-three towns in this plain; and in B.C. 312 the greater part of it must have been free from the marshes, since the censor Appius Claudius constructed the celebrated Via Appia in that year through the plain, which must then have been sufficiently strong to bear the weight of this road. In the time of Augustus there was a navigable canal running alongside of the Via Appia from Forum Appii to the grove of Feronia, which was intended to carry off a portion of the waters of the marshes. Horace embarked upon this canal on his celebrated journey from Rome to Brundisium in B.C. 37. Juvenal (iii. 307) speaks of the marshes as the haunt of highway robbers.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γέφυρα</foreign>). A bridge. The earliest bridge mentioned in history is one built at Babylon across the Euphrates. It was of wood, and was constructed in the reign of Queen Nitocris, about B.C. 606 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 178" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 178</bibl>-186). In <ref type="cross" target="crossgreece">Greece</ref> the earliest bridges were temporary ones resting on floats like a pontoon, with cables of flax and papyrus tightly strained by windlasses to support the planking. These bridges were called <foreign lang="greek">σχεδίαι</foreign>, and were for military purposes only. Such was the high bridge thrown across the Thracian Bosporus by a Samian Greek named Mandrocles at the order of the Persian king Darius ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 83" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 83</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  85" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 85</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  87" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 87</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  88" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 88</bibl>), and such also, though more carefully built, was that over the Hellespont connecting Sestos and Abydos, built for Xerxes when he invaded Greece in B.C. 480 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 36</bibl>). It was not, in fact, until Greece had fallen under Roman influence that permanent bridges were built over its streams, partly because these were so very narrow, and partly perhaps because of the feeling that to span a river with a bridge was an insult to the rivergod. Later, however, the Roman engineers erected massive structures of stone of remarkable size, as that over the Acheron which was a thousand feet 
<pb n="1298" /><cb />
 in length (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 4. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iv. 1</bibl>), and that which united the island of Euboea to the mainland.</p>
 <p>The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi>, in fact, were great bridge-builders, employing brick and concrete, or solid stone masonry fastened by iron clamps and lead. Roman bridges were usually quite narrow in proportion to their length. The central roadway for horses and vehicles was called <seg lang="la">iter.</seg> By the side of it ran footpaths, slightly raised and protected on the outside by a low wall. In the most elaborate bridges, such as the Pons Aelius at Rome, statues and columns were set at regular intervals along the parapet, while the main arches were decorated with mouldings. In some cases a tower was built as a defence at each end of the bridge.</p>
 <p>Under the later Roman Empire the following bridges existed in the city of Rome:</p>
 <p>(1) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Sublicius</hi>, which got its name from the wooden beams (<seg lang="la">sublicae</seg>) of which it was built. Until the second century B.C. this was the only bridge in Rome. It was said to have been built by Ancus Martius, and it connected the main city with the long walls leading from the right bank of the Tiber to the fortress on the Ianiculum. No traces of it now exist.</p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Aemilius</hi>, also called the Pons Lapideus, which was the first stone bridge built in Rome. It was begun in B.C. 179 and completed about 146. It spanned the river near the theatre of Marcellus on the site now occupied by the Ponte Rotto.</p>
 <p>(3) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Fabricius</hi>, built in B.C. 62 by L. Fabricius, as is recorded in inscriptions cut across the face of its arches. It unites the Insula Tiberina with the left bank of the river. During the Middle Ages this bridge was called Pons Iudaeus, from its proximity to the Jewish quarter (Ghetto).</p>
 <p>(4) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Cestius</hi>, which unites the Insula Tiberina to the right side of the river. It was probably built in B.C. 46, and an inscription upon it records its restoration in A.D. 370.</p>
 <p>(5) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Aelius</hi>, built in A.D. 135 by the emperor Hadrian to connect his Mausoleum with the Campus Martius. (See illustration, p. 1018.)</p>
 <p>(6) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Aurelius</hi>, of uncertain date and probably on the site of the modern Ponte Sisto.</p>
 <p>(7) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Neroniānus</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Vaticānus</hi>, begun by Caligula and completed by Nero. The foundations of its piers are still visible in summertime a little below the Pons Aelius.</p>
 <p>(8) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pons Mulvius</hi>, now called Ponte Molle, continues the Via Flaminia across the Tiber. It was built in B.C. 109 by the censor, M. Aemilius Scaurus. On this bridge Cicero caused the arrest of the ambassadors of the Allobroges at the time of Catiline's conspiracy, and in A.D. 312 it was the scene of the rout of Maxentius by Constantine. Under the Empire the Pons Mulvius was a favourite pleasure-resort for the lower classes of Rome ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiii. 47</bibl>). Bridges in general were thronged by beggars who importuned the passersby. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmendicus">Mendicus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Among the best-preserved stone bridges built <cb /> by the Romans and still preserved are the bridge at Rimini (Ariminum), shown in the accompanying illustration; the combined aqueduct and bridge near Nîmes, in France (see illustration under <ref type="cross" target="crossnemausus">Nemausus</ref>); the single-arched bridge near Brioude <figure id="fig.01298">
<head orig="Roman Bridge at Rimini.">Roman Bridge at Rimini.</head>
</figure> over the Allier; and (in a less complete condition) the bridges at Narni near Rome and at Alcantara across the river Tagus in Spain, this last being 670 feet in length.</p>
 <p>The Romans showed great skill in constructing temporary bridges. The most famous of these was the bridge built by Caesar over the Rhine and described by him in a passage (<title>B. G.</title> iv. 17) whose translation and explanation are the terror of school-boys, and of some schoolmasters as well. This bridge was finished within ten days, and may be described as follows:</p>
 <p>It was supported on a series of double piles, formed of two baulks of timber, each eighteen <figure id="fig.01298.2"><head>Plan of Caesar's Bridge over the Rhine. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Rough joists. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Wattle-work. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Roadway of earth.</head></figure> inches square (in section), pointed at one end, and driven into the bed of the river by machines called <seg lang="la">fistucae;</seg> they were set in a sloping direction, so as to resist the force of the current. A corresponding parallel row of piles was driven in at a distance of forty feet, thus forming a very wide roadway for the Roman army. The cross-pieces were two feet thick, and were supported by cross struts <figure id="fig.01298.3">
<head orig="Transverse Section of Caesar's Bridge.">Transverse Section of Caesar's Bridge.</head>
</figure> so as to diminish the bearing. A little higher up the stream a third row of piles was fixed to support “fenders,” to secure the main structure from injury in case the enemy set heavy trees to float down the river and strike against the supports of the bridge.

 <p>Other temporary bridges were supported by floating casks (<seg lang="la">dolia, cupae</seg>) or on boats (Veget. iii. 7; Florus, iii. 5). The accompanying illustration shows one of the latter bridges. <figure id="fig.01299.2">

<div2 id="crosspontifex" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Pontĭfex">Pontifex</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γεφυροποιός</foreign>). A member of the highest priestly <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> in Rome, to which belonged the superintendence over all sacred observances, whether performed by the State or by private persons. The meaning of the name is uncertain; for the interpretation which follows most obviously from the form of the word, that of “bridge-builder,” referring in particular to the sacred bridge on piles (<seg lang="la">pons sublicius</seg>) over the Tiber (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 83), is open to objection. (See Nettleship, <title>Lectures and Essays</title>, p. 27.) It is probable, however, that the pontifex got his name from the duty assigned him of performing rites for the propitiation of river <cb /> deities on the building of bridges; for a widespread superstition regarded the spanning of a river by a bridge as in itself insulting to the divinity of the stream. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspons">Pons</ref>.</p>
 <p>The foundation of the college is ascribed to Numa. At first it probably consisted of six patrician members, with the addition of the king, whose place, after the abolition of the monarchy, was transferred to the Pontifex Maximus; from B.C. 300 it was composed of nine members (four patrician and five plebeian), from the time of Sulla of fifteen (seven patrician and eight plebeian); Caesar added another member; and the emperors also raised the number at their pleasure. The office was for life, as was also that of the president. While, in the time of the monarchy, the pontiffs were probably named by the king, under the Republic the college for a long time filled up its own numbers by coöptation, and also appointed the high-pontiff from among its members. From somewhere about B.C. 250 the election of the latter took place in the Comitia Tributa under the presidency of a pontiff, and, from B.C. 103, the other members were also elected in the Comitia out of a fixed number of candidates presented by the college. Under the Empire a preliminary election was held by the Senate, and merely confirmed by the Comitia.</p>
 <p>Besides the pontiffs proper, there were also included in the college the <seg lang="la">rex sacrorum</seg>, the three higher <hi rend="italic">flamines</hi> and the three <seg lang="la">pontifices minores</seg>, who assisted the pontiffs in transactions relating to sacrifices and in their official business, besides sharing in the deliberations and the banquets of the whole college: these ranked according to length of service. In earlier times an advanced age with freedom from secular offices was necessary for eligibility to the pontificate; the high-pontiff, among other restrictions, was not allowed to leave Italy, was obliged to have a wife without reproach, and might not enter upon a second marriage or see a dead body, much less touch one. As regards his position, he was, as spiritual successor of the king, the sole holder and exerciser of the pontifical power; and his official dwelling was in the king's house, the <seg lang="la">regia</seg> of Numa adjoining the Forum, the seat of the oldest State worship. The college existed by his side only as a deliberative and executive body of personal assistants. He appointed to the most important priestly offices of the State—those of <seg lang="la">flamen</seg>, of Vestal Virgin, and of <seg lang="la">rex sacrorum;</seg> he made public the authoritative decisions of the college. In matters which came within the limits of his official action, he had the right of taking auspices, of holding assemblies of the people, and of publishing edicts. He also exercised a certain jurisdiction over the persons subject to his highpriestly power, especially the flamens and Vestals, over whom his authority was that of an actual father. Owing to the great importance of the office, the emperors from the time of Augustus undertook it themselves until the year 382. As regards the functions of the college, besides performing a number of special sacrifices in the service of the household gods, they exercised (as already mentioned) a superintendence over the whole domain of the religious services recognized by the State, public and private. In all doubts which arose concerning the religious obligations of the State towards the gods, or concerning the form of any religious offices which were to be undertaken, their 
<pb n="1300" /><cb />
 opinion was asked by the Senate and by the other secular bodies, which were obliged unhesitatingly to follow it. In the various religious transactions, expiatory offerings, vows, dedications, consecrations, solemn appropriations, undertaken on behalf of the State, their assistance was invited by the official bodies, in order that they might provide for the correct performance, especially by dictating the prayers. The knowledge of the various rites was handed down by the <seg lang="la">libri pontificii</seg>, which were preserved in the official dwelling of the highpontiff and kept secret. These included the forms of prayer, the rules of ritual for the performance of ceremonial observances, the <seg lang="la">acta pontificum</seg>— i. e. the records relating to the official actions of the college—and the <seg lang="la">commentarii pontificum</seg>—i. e. the collection of opinions delivered, to which they were as a rule obliged to have recourse when giving new ones.</p>
 <p>An important and, indeed, universal influence was exercised by the pontiffs, not only on religious, but also on civic life, by means of the regulation of the calendar, which was assigned to them as possessing technical knowledge of the subject, and by means of their superintendence over the observance of the holidays. Owing to the character of the Roman reckoning of the year, it was necessary from time to time to intercalate certain days, with a view to bringing the calendar into agreement with the actual seasons to which the festivals were originally attached; and special technical knowledge was needed, in order to be sure on what day the festivals fell. This technical knowledge was kept secret by the pontiffs as being a means of power. It was for the month actually current that they gave information to the people as to the distribution of the days, the festivals falling within the month, and the lawful and unlawful days (<seg lang="la">fasti</seg> and <seg lang="la">nefasti;</seg> see <ref type="cross" target="crossdies">Dies</ref>) for civil and legal transactions. In B.C. 304 the calendar of the months was made public by Gnaeus Flavius; but the pontiffs still retained the right of regulating the year by intercalations, and thereby the power of furthering or hindering the aims of parties and individuals by arbitrary insertion of intercalary months. This they kept until the final regulation of the year introduced by Caesar as high-pontiff in B.C. 46. Closely connected with the superintendence of the calendar was the keeping of the lists of the yearly magistrates, especially of the consuls, since it was by their names that the years were dated, as well as the keeping of the yearly chronicle.</p>
 <p>As experts in the law of ritual, the pontiffs had the superintendence over many transactions of private life, so far as ceremonial questions were connected with them, such as the conclusion of marriages, adoption by means of arrogation, and burial. Even upon the civil law they had originally great influence, inasmuch as they alone were in traditional possession of the solemn legal formulae, known as the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg>, which were necessary for every legal transaction, including the settlement of legal business and the forms for bringing lawsuits. They even gave legal opinions, which obtained recognition in the courts as customary law by the side of the written law, and grew into a second authoritative source of Roman law. Until the establishment of the praetorship (B.C. 366), a member of the college was appointed every year to impart information to private persons <cb /> concerning the legal forms connected with the formulating of plaints and other legal business. The <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were made public for the first time by the above-mentioned Flavius at the same time as the calendar.

This kingdom reached its greatest height under Mithridates VI., who for many years carried on war with the Romans. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmithridates">Mithridates VI</ref>.)

<pb n="1302" /><cb />
 and philosophy at Athens with Longinus, who, instead of his Syrian name <title>Malchus</title> (“king”), gave him the Greek name Porphyrios (“clad in royal purple”). The fame of the Neoplatonist <ref type="cross" target="crossplotinus">Plotinus</ref> (q.v.) drew him in 263 to Rome, where, after some initial opposition, he for six years enthusiastically devoted himself to the study of the Neoplatonic philosophy. Being attacked by a dangerous melancholy, the result of overwork, he went, on the advice of Plotinus, to Sicily, whence after five years he returned to Rome, strengthened in mind and body. Here, until his death (304), he taught philosophy in the spirit of Plotinus, especially by bringing the teaching of his master within the reach of general knowledge by his clear and attractive exposition. His most important scholar was Iamblichus. A man of varied culture, Porphyrius was particularly prolific as an author in the domain of philosophy, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, and music; however, most of his works, including the most important, are lost, among them a treatise against the Christians, in fifteen books, which was publicly burned under Theodosius II. (435). We have to lament the loss of his history of Greek philosophy before Plato, in four books, of which we now possess only the (certainly uncritical) life of Pythagoras, and that not complete. Besides this there are preserved a life of Plotinus; a compendium of the system of Plotinus, in the form of aphorisms; a work on abstaining from animal food (<title>De Abstinentia</title>), in four books, from the Pythagorean point of view, valuable for its fulness of information on philosophy, and on the religions, forms of ritual, and customs of various peoples; an introduction to the <title>Categories</title> of Aristotle, and a commentary on the same, in the form of questions and answers; a compendium of his own practical philosophy in the form of a letter to Marcella, a widow without property, and with seven children, whom Plotinus married in his old age on account of her enthusiasm for philosophy; scholia on Homer, discussions on a number of Homeric questions, an allegorical interpretation of the Homeric story of the grotto of the nymphs in the <title>Odyssey</title>, and a commentary on the <title>Harmonics</title> of Ptolemy.

<head orig="Porsena">Porsena</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Porsenna,</hi> <ref type="cross" target="crosslars">Lars</ref>. A king of the Etruscan town of Clusium, who marched against Rome at the head of a vast army, in order to restore Tarquinius Superbus to the throne. He took possession of the hill Ianiculum, and would have entered the city by the bridge which connected Rome with the Ianiculum, had it not been for the superhuman prowess of Horatius Cocles, who kept the whole Etruscan army at bay while his comrades broke down the bridge behind him. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscocles">Cocles</ref>.) The Etruscans proceeded to lay siege to the city, which soon began to suffer from famine. Thereupon a young Roman, named C. Mucius, resolved to deliver his country by murdering the invading king. He accordingly went over to the Etruscan camp, but, ignorant of the person of Porsena, killed the royal secretary instead. Seized, and threatened with torture, he thrust his right hand into the fire on the altar, and there let it burn, to show how little he heeded pain. Astonished at his courage, the king bade him depart in <cb /> peace; and Scaevola, as he was henceforward called, told him, out of gratitude, to make peace with Rome, since three hundred noble youths had sworn to take the life of the king, and he was the first upon whom the lot had fallen. Porsena thereupon made peace with the Romans and withdrew his troops from the Ianiculum after receiving twenty hostages from the Romans. Such was the tale by which Roman vanity concealed one of the earliest and greatest disasters of the city (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 9</bibl>-15). The real fact is, that Rome was completely conquered by Porsena. This is expressly stated by Tacitus ( <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 3. 72" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>iii. 72</bibl>), and is confirmed by other writers ( <bibl n="Dionys.  5. 34" default="NO">Dionys.v. 34</bibl>). Pliny tells us that so thorough was the subjection of the Romans that they were expressly prohibited from using iron for any other purpose but agriculture ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 139" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 139</bibl>). The Romans, however, did not long remain subject to the Etruscans. After the conquest of Rome, Aruns, the son of Porsena, proceeded to attack Aricia, but was defeated before the city by the united forces of the Latin cities, assisted by the Greeks of Cumae. The Etruscans appear, in consequence, to have been confined to their own territory on the right bank of the Tiber, and the Romans to have availed themselves of the opportunity to recover their independence. Remains of the magnificent tomb of Porsena still exist at Chiusi, the ancient Clusium. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstarquinius">Tarquinius</ref>.

In some cities the gates had two passages close together, one for carriages entering and one for those leaving the place. There were also, as at Pompeii, small side-passages for persons on foot. Gateways usually had a small chamber on one side or both, for the use of the guard or porter, and resembling the <seg lang="la">cella ostiaria</seg> in a private house (Polyb. viii. 20, 23, 24). 
<pb n="1303" /><cb /> It was called <foreign lang="greek">πυλών</foreign>. The contrivances for fastening a gate were about the same as those used for doors, only larger in proportion.

 <p> The Roman name for a colonnade. The porticoes of ancient Rome must not be regarded as isolated structures, but as really forming a great connected maze of sheltered walks, in which one could cross, for instance, the whole Campus Martius, or go in a direct line from the Forum Boarium to the Mausoleum of Hadrian, a distance of more than two miles. Professor Lanciani estimates the space covered by the twelve larger porticoes of the Campus Martius as 4600 square yards, the surface protected from sun and rain as 28,000 square yards, and the total area of the porticoes, including the central gardens, as 100,000 square yards. These porticoes were decorated with columns of marble adorned with gilded bronze, and their pavements were inlaid with jasper and porphyry. Each one contained a gallery of sculpture and a collection of paintings, while the space which they enclosed was beautified by gardens, lakes, groves, fountains, and water-falls. There were also museums within their walls, such as one of natural history (in the Portico of the Septa), of Oriental curiosities (in the same), and of wigs and specimens of hair-dressing (in the Portico of Marcius Philippus).

Under the emperors customs were levied not only at the frontier of the Empire, but also at the frontiers of the several provinces or of combinations of provinces united in one excise-district. The percentage on the purchasing price of articles was different in different districts. Besides this, export duties were levied on corn, oil, wine, salt, iron, and gold.

<div2 id="crossposeidon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Poseidon">Poseidon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ποσειδῶν</foreign>). The god of the sea and the flowing waters—a name connected with the root of <foreign lang="greek">πότος, πόντος</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">πόταμος</foreign>. He was the son of Cronos and Rhea and dwelt in the sea, over which he ruled. With his brazen-hoofed horses he was said to ride over the waves, which became smooth as he approached, and the monsters of the deep recognized him and played around his chariot. Generally he yoked his horses to his chariot himself, but sometimes he was assisted by Amphitrité. Although he generally dwelt in the sea, still he also appears at Olympus in the assembly of the gods. Poseidon, in conjunction with Apollo, is said to have built the walls of Troy for Laomedon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossilium">Ilium</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstroia">Troia</ref>.) Laomedon refused to give these gods the reward which had been stipulated, and even dismissed them with threats. Poseidon, in consequence, sent a marine monster, which was on the point of devouring Laomedon's daughter, when it was killed by Heracles; and he continued to bear an implacable hatred against the Trojans. He sided with the Greeks in the war against Troy, sometimes witnessing the contest as a spectator from the heights of Thrace, and sometimes interfering in person, assuming the appearance of a mortal hero and encouraging the Greeks, while Zeus favoured the Trojans. In the <title>Odyssey</title>, Poseidon appears hostile to Odysseus, whom he prevents from returning home in consequence of his having blinded Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon by the nymph Thoösa.</p>
 <p>Being the ruler of the sea (the Mediterranean), he is described as gathering clouds and calling forth storms, but at the same time he has it in his power to grant a successful voyage and save those who are in danger; and all other marine divinities are subject to him. As the sea surrounds and holds the earth, he himself is described as the god 
<pb n="1304" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01304">
<head orig="Poseidon. (Dolce Gem. )">Poseidon. (Dolce Gem. )</head>
</figure>
 who holds the earth (<foreign lang="greek">γαιήοχος</foreign>), and who has it in his power to shake the earth (<foreign lang="greek">ἐνοσίχθων, κινητὴρ γᾶς</foreign>). He was further regarded as the creator of the horse. It is said that when Poseidon and Athené disputed as to which of them should give the name to the capital of Attica, the gods decided that it should receive its name from the deity who should bestow upon man the most useful gift. Poseidon then created the horse, and Athené called forth the olive-tree, in consequence of which the honour was conferred upon the goddess. According to others, however, Poseidon did not create the horse in Attica, but in Thessaly, where he also gave the famous horses to Peleus. Poseidon was accordingly believed to have taught men the art of managing horses by the bridle, and to have been the originator and protector of horse-races. Hence he was also represented on horseback, or riding in a chariot drawn by two or four horses, and is designated by the epithets <foreign lang="greek">ἵππιος, ἵππειος</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἵππιος ἄναξ</foreign>. He even metamorphosed himself into a horse for the purpose of deceiving Demeter. The symbol of Poseidon's power was the trident, or a spear with three points, with which he used to shatter rocks, to call forth or subdue storms, to shake the earth, and the like. Herodotus states that the name and worship of Poseidon were brought into Greece from Libya; but he was probably a divinity of Pelasgian origin, and originally a personification of the fertilizing power of water, from which the transition to regarding him as the god of the sea was not difficult. The following legends respecting Poseidon deserve to be mentioned. In conjunction with Zeus he fought against Cronos and the Titans; and in the contest with the giants he pursued Polybotes across <cb /> the sea as far as Cos, and there killed him by throwing the island upon him. He further crushed the Centaurs when they were pursued by Heracles, under a mountain in Leucosia, the island of the Sirens. He sued, together with Zeus, for the hand of Thetis; but he withdrew when Themis prophesied that the son of Thetis would be greater than his father. When Ares had been caught in the wonderful net by Hephaestus, the latter set him free at the request of Poseidon; but the latter god afterwards brought a charge against Ares before the Areopagus for having killed his son Halirrhothius. At the request of Minos, king of Crete, Poseidon caused a bull to rise from the sea, which the king promised to sacrifice; but when Minos treacherously concealed the animal among a herd of oxen, the god punished Minos by causing his wife <ref type="cross" target="crosspasiphae">Pasiphaë</ref> (q.v.) to fall in love with the bull.</p>
 <p>Poseidon was married to Amphitrité, by whom he had three children, Triton, Rhodé, and Benthesicymé; but he had also a vast number of children by other divinities and mortal women. His worship extended over all Greece and Southern Italy, but he was more especially revered in Peloponnesus and in the Ionic towns on the coast. The sacrifices offered to him generally consisted of black and white bulls; but wild boars and rams were also sacrificed to him. Horse and chariot races were held in his honour on the Corinthian Isthmus. The Panionia, or the festival of all the Ionians near Mycalé, was celebrated in honour of Poseidon. In works of art, Poseidon may be easily recognized by his attributes, the dolphin, the horse, or the trident, and he was frequently represented in groups along with Amphitrité, Tritons, Nereïds, dolphins. the Dioscuri, Palaemon, Pegasus, Bellerophontes, Thalassa, Ino, and Galené. His figure does not present the majestic calm which characterizes his brother Zeus; but as the state of the sea is varying, so also is the god represented sometimes in violent agitation and sometimes in a state of repose.

 <p> The Latin term for a public crier, such as those who were employed in private life, especially at auctions. Their profession was eminently lucrative, but was not considered at all respectable.

 <p> The commander of the troops who guarded the person of the Roman emperor. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspraetoriani">Praetoriani</ref>.) This office was instituted by Augustus, and was at first only military. It then had comparatively small power attached to it; but under Tiberius, who made Seianus commander of the Praetorian Guard, it became of much greater importance, till at length the power of these praefects became only second to that of the emperors. From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian, the praefects, like the Oriental viziers, had the superintendence of all departments of the State, the palace, the army, the finances, and the law; and also had a court in which they decided cases. The office of Praefect of the Praetorium was not confined to military officers: it was filled by Ulpian and Papinian, and by other distinguished jurists. Originally there were two praefects; afterwards sometimes one and sometimes two; from the time of Commodus often three, and even four. They were, as a regular rule, chosen only from the knights; but from the time of Alexander Severus the rank of senator was always joined with their office.

<div2 id="crosspraefectus-urbi" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Praefectus Urbi">Praefectus Urbi</head>

 <p> The praefect or warden of the city of Rome. He was originally called <ref type="cross" target="crosscustos-urbis">Custos Urbis</ref> (Lydus, <title>De Magistr.</title> i. 34, 38). The name <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi</seg> does not seem to have been used till after the time of the decemvirs. The dignity of <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg>, being combined with that of <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg>, was conferred in early times by the king, as he had to appoint one of the <seg lang="la">decem primi</seg> as <seg lang="la">princeps senatus.</seg> The functions of the <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg>, however, were not exercised except in the absence of the king from Rome; and then he acted as the representative of the king. He convoked the Senate, held the Comitia, if necessary, and on any emergency might take such measures as he thought proper; in short, he had the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> in the city ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 6. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>vi. 11</bibl>). During the kingly period, the office of <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg> was probably for life. Under the Republic, the office and the title <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg> remained unaltered; but in B.C. 487 it was elevated into a magistracy, to be bestowed by election. The <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg> was, in all probability, elected by the <seg lang="la">curiae.</seg> Persons of consular rank alone were eligible. In the early years of the Republic the <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg> exercised within the city all the powers of the consuls if they were absent; he convoked the Senate, held the Comitia, and, in times of war, even levied civic legions, which were commanded by him. When the office of <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> was instituted, the wardenship of the city was merged in it (Lydus, <title>De Mens.</title> 19); but as the Romans, by reason of their extreme conservatism, were at all times averse to dropping altogether any of their old institutions, a <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi</seg>, though a mere shadow of the former office, was henceforth appointed every year, only for the time that the consuls were absent from Rome for the purpose of celebrating the Feriae Latinae. This praefectus had neither the power of convoking the Senate nor the right of speaking in it; in most cases he was a person below the senatorial age, and was not appointed by the people, but by the consuls.</p>
 <p>An office very different from this, though bearing the same name, was instituted by Augustus on the suggestion of Maecenas. This new Praefectus Urbi was a regular and permanent magistrate, whom Augustus invested with all the powers necessary to maintain peace and order in the city. He had the superintendence of butchers, bankers, guardians, theatres, etc.; and to enable him to exercise his power he had distributed throughout the city a number of <seg lang="la">milites stationarii</seg>, whom we may compare to modern police. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvigiles">Vigiles</ref>.) His jurisdiction, however, became gradually extended; and as the powers of the ancient republican Praefectus Urbi had been swallowed up by the office of the Praetor Urbanus, so now the power of the Praetor Urbanus was gradually absorbed by that of the Praefectus Urbi; and at last there was no appeal from his sentence, except to the person of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> himself, while any one might appeal from the sentence of any other city magistrate, and, at a later period, even from that of a governor of a province, to the tribunal of the Praefectus Urbi. Under the Eastern Empire, there was a Praefectus Urbi for the city of Constantinople as well as for Rome (Symmach. <title>Epist.</title> x. 37).

<head orig="Praetor">Praetor</head>

 <p> (=<foreign lang="greek">στρατηγός</foreign>, and derived by Cicero from <seg lang="la">praeire</seg>). Originally a title of the Roman consuls, but afterwards used to denote that magistrate to whom the administration of justice in Rome was transferred, when the consulship, to which this power had hitherto been attached, was thrown open to the commons in B.C. 366. At first reserved for the patricians, it became a <cb /> plebeian office as early as 337. The praetor was elected in the Comitia Centuriata, with one of the consuls presiding, on the same day and with the same auspices as the consuls, who entered on their office simultaneously with him. On account of the increase in legal business, a second praetor was appointed in 242, to whom was transferred the hearing of the cases between citizens and foreigners (<seg lang="la">inter cives et peregrinos</seg>) and between foreigners (<seg lang="la">inter peregrinos</seg>), while the other decided between citizens. The latter, who ranked first, was called <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> (city praetor); the former, <seg lang="la">praetor inter peregrinos</seg> and (after the time of Vespasian) <seg lang="la">praetor peregrinus.</seg></p>
 <p>The praetors had their respective departments determined by lot after their election. While the <seg lang="la">praetor peregrinus</seg> might have a military command also intrusted to him, the city praetor, on account of the importance of his office, might not be absent from Rome, strictly speaking, for longer than ten days. He represented his absent colleague and also the consuls in their absence, presiding, as the highest magistrate present, at the public games, watching over the safety of Rome, summoning the Comitia Centuriata, holding the military levies, and the like. As early as 227 the number was further increased by two. To these was intrusted the administration of Sicily and Sardinia. Two others were added in 197 to administer the two provinces of Spain. In 149, on the establishment of the <seg lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</seg>, a standing criminal court for certain stated offenders, the rule was introduced that the entire body of praetors should stay in Rome during their year of office; the praetors <seg lang="la">urbanus</seg> and <seg lang="la">inter peregrinos</seg> having jurisdiction in civil cases, as hitherto, while the others presided in the <seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>, and had to instruct the jurors as to the case before the court, and to carry out the sentence passed. After the completion of their year of office, they all proceeded as propraetors or proconsuls to the praetorian provinces assigned them by lot. In consequence of the multiplication of the <seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg> and of the provinces, the number of praetors was raised by Sulla to eight, by Caesar to ten, fourteen, and sixteen. Under the Empire the praetorship lost its former importance, the civil jurisdiction of the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> and <seg lang="la">peregrinus</seg> being in part transferred to the <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi</seg> and <seg lang="la">praefectus praetorio</seg>, while the criminal jurisdiction of the others ceased with the gradual decay of the <seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>, and the praetors retained only particular departments of their judicial power and general administration. Their most important function was the management of the games, some of which had already, in republican times, been assigned to the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus.</seg> When their year's office had expired, they went as proconsuls to the senatorial provinces. Their election was transferred to the Senate by Tiberius. Under the Republic the statutory age for the office was forty; under the Empire, thirty. The praetor's <seg lang="la">insignia</seg> were the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, and, in the provinces, six lictors; in Rome, probably two. Like the consul, he had the honour of a triumph open to him. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>.

 chief military command, was among the first administrative measures of Augustus. The supreme command was generally held by two <seg lang="la">praefecti praetorio</seg> in the emperor's name. The guard consisted of nine, and at a later time, of ten <seg lang="la">cohortes praetoriae</seg>, each composed of ten centuries of infantry and ten squadrons of cavalry (<seg lang="la">turmae</seg>), and commanded by a <seg lang="la">tribunus</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstribuni-militum">Tribuni Militum</ref>). They had higher rank and pay than the legions, and a shorter time of service (sixteen years instead of twenty). While the other cohorts were stationed at various places in Italy, where the emperors were in the habit of staying, there were quartered in Rome, to keep watch in the emperor's palace, three cohorts, which at first were billeted on separate parts of the city, until under Tiberius they were placed in a fortified camp (<seg lang="la">castra praetoria</seg>) to the northeast of the city, outside the walls. By being thus united, they gained such importance that they were often able to raise an emperor to the throne, and to overthrow him. To break down their influence and to make them simply a picked corps, Septimius Severus, towards the end of the second century, brought legions to Italy, and made a regulation that the Guard, which had hitherto been recruited exclusively from Italy and a few Romanized provinces, should have its ranks filled up from deserving legionary soldiers, and should serve for a longer time. To be thus transferred to the Guard was considered a promotion. The Guard was disbanded by Constantine the Great.

</figure> the divine and human form. Still, he paid most attention to youthful figures, which gave him the opportunity of displaying all the charm of sensuous grace in soft and delicate contours.</p>
 <p>Among his most celebrated works the naked Aphrodité, of Cnidus, stands first—according to the enthusiastic descriptions of the ancients a masterpiece of the most entrancing beauty (e. g. Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.  20" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 20</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H.

Not less famous were his representations of Eros, among which the marble statue at Thespiae was esteemed most highly (ib. 22; cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosseros">Eros</ref>); his Apollo Sauroctonos (lizard-slayer) in bronze (ib. xxxiv. 70); and a youthful Satyr in Athens <cb /> (Pausan. i. 20. 1). As to the group of Niobé's children, preserved at Rome in Pliny 's time, it was disputed even among the ancients whether it was the work of Praxiteles or, as is more probable, of Scopas ( <bibl n="Plin.

When Heracles took the city of Troy Priam was in the number of his prisoners; but his sister, Hesioné, redeemed him from captivity, and he exchanged his original name of Podarces for that of Priamus, which signifies “bought” or “ransomed.” (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshesione">Hesioné</ref>.) He was placed on his father's throne by Heracles, and employed himself in repairing, fortifying, and embellishing the city of Troy. He had married, by his father's orders, Arisba, whom now he divorced for Hecuba, the daughter of Dymas the Phrygian ( <bibl n="Hom.

After he had reigned for some time 
<pb n="1311" /><cb />
 in the greatest prosperity, Priam expressed a desire to recover his sister Hesioné, whom Heracles had carried into Greece, and married to Telamon, his friend. To carry this plan into execution, Priam manned a fleet, of which he gave the command to his son Paris, with orders to bring back Hesioné. Paris, to whom Aphrodité had promised the fairest woman in the world (see <ref type="cross" target="crossparis">Paris</ref>), neglected, in some measure, his father's injunctions, and, as if to make reprisals upon the Greeks, carried away Helen, the wife of Menelaüs, king of Sparta, during the absence of her husband. This violation of hospitality caused a general war. All the suitors of Helen, at the request of <ref type="cross" target="crossmenelaus">Menelaüs</ref> (q.v.), assembled to avenge the abduction of his wife, and the combined armament set sail for Troy. Priam might have averted the impending blow by the restoration of Helen; but this he refused to do when the ambassadors of the Greeks came to him for that purpose. Troy was accordingly beleaguered, and frequent skirmishes took place, in which the success was various. The siege was continued for ten successive years, and Priam had the misfortune to see the greater part of his sons fall in defence of their native city. Hector, the eldest of these, was the only one upon whom now the Trojans looked for protection and support; but he, too, fell a victim to his own courage, and was slain by Achilles. The father thereupon resolved to go in person to the Grecian camp, and ransom the body of the bravest of his children. The gods interested themselves in his behalf, and Hermes was directed to guide the aged monarch in safety amid the dangers of the way, and conduct him to the tent of Achilles. The meeting of Priam and Achilles was solemn and affecting. The conqueror paid to the Trojan monarch the reverence due to his dignity, his years, and his misfortunes; and Priam, as a suppliant, addressed the prince who had robbed him of the greatest and best of his sons. Achilles was moved by his tears and entreaties. He restored Hector, and permitted Priam a truce of twelve days for the funeral of his son. Some time after Troy was betrayed into the hands of the Greeks by Antenor and Aeneas, and Priam was slain by Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, at the foot of the altar of Zeus Herceus; the wounded Polites, one of the sons of Priam, also fell, who, after the example of his father and mother, had fled thither for protection during the burning of the city ( <bibl n="Hom.

After the death of Nero (68), he was restored to his former rank by Galba, and appointed to the command of the seventh legion, which was stationed in Pannonia. He was one of the first generals in Europe who declared in favor of Vespasian, and rendered him the most important services. In conjunction with the governors of Moesia and Pannonia, he invaded Italy, gained a decisive victory over the Vitellian army at Bedriacum, and took Cremona, which he allowed his soldiers to pillage and destroy. He afterwards forced his way into Rome, notwithstanding the obstinate resistance of the Vitellian troops, and had the government of the city till the arrival of Mucianus from Syria. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmucianus">Mucianus</ref>.) We learn from Martial, who was a friend of Antonius Primus, that he was alive at the accession of Trajan.

<head orig="Princeps">Princeps</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἡγεμών</foreign>). The use of the word <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> as a title originated according to Tacitus ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 3. 56" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>iii. 56</bibl>) in the desire of Augustus to secure a term which should express the preëminence of the first citizen of the Republic (<seg lang="la">princeps civitatis</seg>), and imply the possession of all the functions belonging to him, and yet not suggest the idea of despotic rule ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 1</bibl>; ii. 53; <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 4. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>iv. 3</bibl>; Dio Cassius, lvii. 8). The word <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, as thus used, was merely a title of courtesy; it does not appear in the titular list in the inscriptions, it was not official and did not refer to any definite function. 
<pb n="1312" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The origin of the title has been variously assigned to the phrases <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg> and <seg lang="la">princeps civitatis.</seg> The former was an honorary title indicating that the holder was first on the list of senators and was the first to be asked his opinion. We know from Monumentum Ancyranum (Gr. iv. 2) that Caesar was <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg> in B.C. 28. Nevertheless he is always termed simply <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> ( <title>Car.</title> i. 2, 50) and thus speaks of himself (<title>me principe, Mon. Anc.</title> ii. 45; vi. 9). In the same inscription the Greek translation of the word is <foreign lang="greek">ἡγεμών</foreign>. The title <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg> would certainly be too restricted in its application, indicating the relation to the Senate and not to the State.</p>
 <p>The view that the word <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> as used of the emperor was an abridgment of the phrase <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg> which came to have a wider signification is best stated by Herzog in his <title>Geschichte und Syst. der röm. Staatsv.</title> ii. 134. The other view which is more generally accepted is held by Mommsen (<title>Staatsrecht</title>, ii. 733), and is clearly set forth by H. F. Pelham in <title>Jour. of Philol.</title> viii. p. 322. The expression <seg lang="la">princeps civitatis</seg> is found in classical writers and is applied by Cicero to Pompey, while <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, evidently standing for the complete phrase, is used by Cicero of both Pompey and Caesar (<title>Ad Att.</title> viii. 9; <title>Ad Fam.</title> vi. 6), and by Sallust of Pompey (Hist. iii. 61 D or 81 K).

<head orig="Principātus">Principatus</head>

 <p> In January of the year <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c. 27 </hi> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c.</hi> 727) Gaius Caesar Octavianus established the Roman Empire, or, as the new form of government at this stage of its existence may be more correctly termed, the principate. On the thirteenth day of that month he voluntarily laid aside the extra-constitutional powers granted him under the stress of civil disorder and on the sixteenth initiated a new system whose constitutional theory and plan were based upon the old republican form of government.</p>
 <p>According to Augustus's own words, as given in <title>Mon. Anc.</title> vi. 83, <seg lang="la">consulatu sexto</seg> (B.C. 28) <seg lang="la">et septimo</seg> (B.C. 27) <title>rem publicam ex mea potestate in senatus populique Romani arbitrium transtuli</title>, in his sixth consulship he performed the initial act in the abolition of the provisional government by surrendering powers which he had received as triumvir, and which he had held alone after the deposing of Lentulus and after the hostility of Antonius. In January of the following year he completed the restoration of authority to the Senate and people, by what final act it is impossible to say, although at that time he may have surrendered the <seg lang="la">proconsulare imperium</seg> which was involved in the triumviral powers granted by the plebescite of P. Titius (<title>Mon. Anc. Lat.</title> vi. 13;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 28</bibl>; Dio Cass. liii. 2). This voluntary return of intrusted powers was immediately followed by the renewal of the <seg lang="la">proconsulare imperium</seg> for a period of ten years and by the conferring, by the Senate and people, of the <title>cognomen Augustus</title>, which thus dignified and consecrated the new position assumed by Caesar in his relation to the State, and which became the distinctive title of the principate (<title>Mon. Anc. Lat.</title> vi. 16). The constitution of the principate thus dates from the renunciatory and reëstablishing enactments of January, B.C. 27. <cb /></p>
 <p>Augustus still held, however, some form of the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg> which had been given to him for life in <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c. 36 </hi> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c.</hi> 718) (Dio Cass. xlix. 15). He was also consul, for he succeeded himself each year from <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c. 31-23 </hi> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c.</hi> 723-731) in a series of nine consulships ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 2</bibl>). The <seg lang="la">proconsulare imperium</seg>, which was similar in character to that given to Pompey by the Gabinian and Manilian laws, implied the exclusive command of the armies and fleet, as well as the control of the most important border provinces. Inasmuch as Rome and Italy were not included under this <seg lang="la">imperium</seg>, Augustus relied upon the consulship which not only brought the city and Italy under his control, but rendered his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> superior to that of other proconsuls. This is substantially the view of Mommsen as given in his <title>Staatsrecht</title>, vol. ii. Another theory stated by H. F. Pelham, <title>Jour. of Philol.</title> xvii., bases the new principate entirely on the consulship on the ground that in January, B.C. 27, Augustus, while consul, received from the people the <seg lang="la">consulare imperium</seg> involved in the conferring of the usual “province,” which was in this case of very broad area, carrying with it control of armies, the direction of foreign relations, as well as the government of important provinces.</p>
 <p>On the 27th of June, B.C. 23, Augustus, finding the consulship unsuited to his purpose, laid it aside (Dio Cass. liii. 32) and brought into prominence the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg>, which, being perpetual, he made nominally annual by renewal from year to year. Thenceforward the title TR(<hi rend="italic">ibunicia</hi>) POT(<seg lang="la">estate</seg>) appears in the inscriptions in the titular list followed by a numeral indicating the number of renewals (<title>Corpus Inscr. Latin.</title> indices, particularly vol. iii.). This tribunician power was the civil magistracy supplementing the authority given by the imperium, ranking higher moreover than the latter prerogative (Dio Cass. liii. 32; Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 1050). Through its privileges the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> had the right of <seg lang="la">intercessio</seg> or veto, also that of <seg lang="la">coercitio</seg> or power of compelling obedience, also <seg lang="la">sacrosancta potestas</seg>, so that his person was inviolable. This substitution of <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg> for the consulship involved the loss of <seg lang="la">consulare imperium</seg>, which gave authority in Rome and Italy although naturally it did not interfere with the <seg lang="la">proconsulare imperium.</seg> (According to Mr. Pelham's view stated above, the <seg lang="la">consulare imperium</seg> given Augustus in B.C. 27, which conferred such extensive powers, he now no longer holds as consul, but as proconsul, so that it really becomes <seg lang="la">proconsulare imperium.</seg>) </p>
 <p>The renunciation of the consulship meant, however, the loss of an <seg lang="la">imperium</seg>, superior to that of other proconsuls, as well as most important prerogatives possessed by the consuls alone. This difficulty was met by special legislative action, whereby Augustus received from the Senate and people rights which belonged originally and legitimately to the consulship. These were, the enlargement of his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> as <hi rend="italic">proconsul</hi>, so that it became <seg lang="la">maius</seg> as compared with that of other proconsuls (B.C. 23), the privilege of introducing the first motion in the Senate (<seg lang="la">ius primae relationis</seg>) (B.C. 23), the right of convening the Senate (B.C. 22), the insignia of consular dignity—the twelve fasces and the curule chair between those of the consuls (B.C. 19). An inscription, <title>Lex de Imperio Vespasiani </title> (<title>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</title> vi. 930), engraved on a bronze tablet, which is extant in fragmentary form, confers upon Vespasian certain rights which were 
<pb n="1313" /><cb />
 not included in the scope of his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> or of his <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas.</seg> In this <seg lang="la">lex</seg> we probably possess in documentary form the special legislative measures which were passed in favour of Augustus. For opposing views on this subject, see Mommsen (<title>Staatsr.</title> vol. ii.), who believes that the <seg lang="la">lex de imperio</seg> conferred the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg> extended in its scope, and Herzog (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> ii. 617-619), who holds the view expressed above.</p>
 <p>The constitutional theory of the principate that the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> was a citizen provided with exceptional powers by the Senate and people did not look to the transmission of this delegated power, but left the matter in the hands of the Senate and people in so far as the conferring of these remarkable powers was concerned. Thus at the death of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> the principate ended and was not renewed until similar powers had been delegated to his successor, the government being carried on by the consuls during the interregnum. Although there seems to have been no constitutional provision for the selection of a <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, yet, theoretically at least, he was the creature of the people, and his appointment consisted in the conferring of the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> and subsequently of the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg> by the Senate and the people, the latter ratifying the action of the Senate in their Comitia. The final act was the bestowal of special privileges by the <seg lang="la">lex de imperio.</seg> In these acts the choice of the one thus honoured is implied and involved. Although the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> was in theory elected, the choice, however, virtually depended upon certain influences which indicated and determined the selection, as, for example, in times of peace the designating of a son or near relative on the part of the reigning <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> and the investing such a one with powers of an imperial nature so as to confirm the choice. In time of civil strife other influences naturally prevailed, such as popularity with the Senate or army, or marked military ability. For opposing theories as to the election of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, see Herzog, <title>Geschichte und Syst. der röm. Staatsv.</title> ii. 610 foll.; Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 1038, and Pelham in the <title>Jour. of Philol.</title> xvii. 47.</p>
 <p>This in outline is the constitution of the principate which recognized the existence of a republican form of government, and also the establishment of a new authority which, standing alongside of the consuls, theoretically the chief magistrates ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 19</bibl>), held under the designation of <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestate</seg> powers equal to those of the consul at home and superior to them abroad. The government is practically in the hands of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> and the Senate, so that it has been aptly termed a dyarchy. The history of the first three centuries of the Christian era records the dissolution of this dyarchy by the absorption of all power by the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, and the disclosure of the imperial government in its true character as an absolute monarchy. The fictitious nature of the principate and the inevitable tendency under such a system to the centralization of power in the hands of Caesar may be more readily appreciated by considering the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, first in his relation to this second governing power, the Senate, and their mutual partition of governmental functions, and again in his personal position as ostensible magistrate but actual monarch, with all the attributes of kingly station.</p>
 <p>The constitution of the Senate was controlled in various ways by the <seg lang="la">princeps.</seg> He was able to influence <cb /> the election of magistrates in the assembly by certain privileges known as <seg lang="la">nominatio</seg> and <seg lang="la">commendatio.</seg> The former arose from the right, belonging to the magistrates (regularly the consuls) presiding at the elections, to canvass the names of the candidates and publish a list of those qualified to stand ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 81" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 81</bibl>). By accepting only a sufficient number to fill vacancies the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> could easily control the election. Through the right of <seg lang="la">commendatio</seg> the princeps recommended his own candidates, <title>candidati Caesaris</title>, and naturally these persons were sure of election ( <bibl n="Vell.  2." default="NO" valid="yes">Vell.ii.</bibl><bibl n="Vell.  124" default="NO" valid="yes">Vell., 124</bibl><bibl n="Vell.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Vell., 4</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 15</bibl>). See also the <title>Lex de Imperio</title>, 4, 12; Mommsen, <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 865.</p>
 <p>Again, while only those of senatorial rank could hold the office of <seg lang="la">quaestor</seg>, the initial office of the senatorial career, yet the emperor would admit to the preliminary service, the vigintivirate and the tribunate of the soldiers, those outside of the senatorial order who were thus placed in the line of promotion as prospective senators (Marquardt, <title>Staatsv.</title> ii. 354). By a process known as <seg lang="la">adlectio</seg> the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> could place a non-senator in the senatorial order, assigning him to the performance of certain functions as those of quaestor or praetor. Hence we find in inscriptions <seg lang="la">adlecti inter praetorios, inter tribunicios</seg>, and rarely <seg lang="la">inter quaestorios</seg>, but after the third century <seg lang="la">inter consulares.</seg> In the meetings of the Senate the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> had the privilege of voting first, also the right of introducing bills (<seg lang="la">relatio</seg>), and of receiving information as to the transactions.</p>
 <p>The Senate under the principate discharged administrative functions in regard to religion, the affairs of Italy, and at first of the city itself; but its important control was over the senatorial provinces. In these provinces, however, the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> had certain powers which resulted from his control of the troops, and again, because of the collection by imperial officers of the revenues which came to the <seg lang="la">fiscus</seg> of the emperor. Since his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> was <seg lang="la">maius</seg>, all proconsuls were his subordinates and under his direction (Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 227). The final result was the entire subordination of authority in the senatorial provinces to that of Caesar. This change is seen in the gradual modification in the relations existing between the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> and the proconsuls of senatorial provinces. The former at first refused to control such officials of the Senate and people ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 2. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>ii. 47</bibl>; iii. 60; Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> iii. 1211), but in the latter part of the second century, Caesar, by virtue of his <seg lang="la">maius imperium</seg>, controlled proconsuls, and looked to them to follow his edicts as carefully as any of his own <seg lang="la">legati </seg> (<title>Lex de Imperio</title>, 6; Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 843). What was true of the provinces was true of the general departments of administration in Italy and in Rome. They were gradually brought under the control of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, so that officers of his own appointment, <seg lang="la">praefecti</seg> and <seg lang="la">procuratores</seg>, were in charge of public works, of the corn supply, and of the <seg lang="la">viae.</seg></p>
 <p>As regards judicial functions, Augustus made the Senate a high court of justice, in which he himself sat, and thus could influence decisions by his vote and by his right of <seg lang="la">intercessio</seg> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 12</bibl>; iv. 34; iii. 70). Although all criminal cases could be brought before this court, only those of the highest importance really fell to its jurisdiction. The emperor also had a private court of his own, before which only cases of political importance seem 
<pb n="1314" /><cb />
 to have been brought ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>32</bibl>). The court of the praetors still existed in Rome and Italy, but the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> often appointed the praetor and frequently sat at his side as <seg lang="la">assessor</seg> (Dio Cass. liii. 2, 3;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 75" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 75</bibl>). Appeals from senatorial provinces against the judicial decisions of governors were often heard by the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> on the authority of his <seg lang="la">maius imperium</seg> (Mommsen, <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 110).</p>
 <p>The Senate, by the republican theory, had no direct legislative power, save through the acceptance of <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg> by the assembly of the people. Under the principate, however, the <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg>, enacted according to the wish of the emperor, became laws. The emperor, however, became the real source of law, for by special acts of the Senate ( <title>Verr.</title> ii. 2, 49, 121) he was empowered to found colonies, grant charters, confer the Roman franchise (<seg lang="la">leges datae</seg>) (e. g. the Lex Malacitana, Bruns, <title>Fontes Iuris Romani</title>, vi. 147; <title>C. I. L.</title> ii. 876, 1964); and on his own authority he issued legislative documents (<seg lang="la">constitutiones</seg>), which were entirely of imperial origin. These were either <seg lang="la">edicta, decreta, rescripta</seg>, or <seg lang="la">epistulae.</seg> See Bruns, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> 237 foll.</p>
 <p>The financial affairs of the Empire were divided between the Senate and the <seg lang="la">princeps.</seg> There was a Senate treasury, known as the <seg lang="la">aerarium</seg>, and also the privy purse of the emperor, the <seg lang="la">fiscus.</seg> The latter was drawn upon not merely for the direct expenses of the emperor, but for provincial administration, the support of the army and fleet, and many public expenditures. The collection of taxes in all the provinces was at first farmed out on the old republican principle, but was ultimately conducted by the imperial officials. The coinage of gold and silver belonged at first to the Senate and emperor, but it was finally given exclusively to the emperor, and the coinage of copper was assigned to the Senate.</p>
 <p>The falseness of the pretensions as to the magisterial character of the principate in the matter of limited tenure was disclosed at an early period in the acceptance by Tiberius and his successors of a life imperium, although the festival known as <seg lang="la">decennalia</seg> still recalled the periodical renewal. According to Dio Cassius (lix. 3, 2), Gaius received the powers of the principate by one grant, an act which showed still further the tendency to individualize the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> in the possession of sole and permanent authority (Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 744). Augustus refused the censorship consistently with his evident purpose; for a <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> possessed of the censor's power would be a monarch, inasmuch as he would absolutely control the constitution of the Senate. He indeed acted at times as censor, but only by virtue of his consular power. Domitian and his successors, however, performed the censorial functions simply by reason of their authority as <seg lang="la">principes</seg> (Mommsen, <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 1018).</p>
 <p>The name of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> was similar to that of an ordinary citizen, but differed in certain special features. The title <seg lang="la">imperator</seg> was substituted by Augustus for his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg>, Gaius ; and although the custom was disregarded by Tiberius, Gaius , and Claudius, it was resumed by Nero and regularly followed by his successors. The inscriptions show that it regularly took the position of a <seg lang="la">praenomen.</seg> A distinction must be made between this use of the word and the <seg lang="la">acclamatio imperatoria</seg> followed by the numeral of iteration, which appears <cb /> among the titles. From the names of the early emperors, with the exception of the Claudii and Vitellius, the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> was omitted, but its use was resumed by Hadrian. Caesar, the inherited <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg> of the Julian family, became a distinguishing mark of the reigning house, but from the time of Hadrian it was restricted to the emperor and his successor.</p>
 <p><title>Augustus</title>, the last word, strictly speaking, in the name of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, was associated with the principate, and was conferred with the official granting of power by the Senate and people. From the latter part of the second century the word <title>Augustus</title> was preceded by additional surnames—e. g. <title>Pius, Pius Felix Invictus</title>—and from the beginning of the fourth century it was strengthened by <seg lang="la">perpetuus</seg> and <seg lang="la">semper.</seg> Special <seg lang="la">cognomina ex virtute</seg>—e. g. <title>Germanicus, Dacicus, Armeniacus</title>—were assumed by Vitellius and Nerva and regularly by Trajan and his successors. The following titles indicating <seg lang="la">honores</seg> also belonged to the imperial name: <title>Pontifex Maximus, Tribunicia Potestate, Imperator, Consul, Censor</title> (held only by Claudius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian), <title>Pater Patriae</title> (declined by Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Hadrian), <title>Proconsul</title> (in the names of Trajan, Hadrian, M. Aurelius, L. Verus, Septimius Severus, and his successors).</p>
 <p>The emperors, because of the founding of the principate upon republican principles and precedents, had the right to use republican insignia, the curule chair, the laurel wreath and gold-embroidered toga of the <seg lang="la">triumphator</seg>, which were henceforth restricted to their use (Dio Cass. liii. 26), and the purple-bound toga of the magistrate (<title>Vita Hadriani</title>, 22). The right to wear the purple <seg lang="la">paludamentum</seg> was granted to Caesar as an indication of the supreme nature of his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg>, but it was rarely used in the first century, although it subsequently became the symbol of assumed authority (Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> i. 349). As <seg lang="la">imperator</seg> the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> had the privilege of carrying the sword of military power. For the personal safety of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> the <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria</seg> kept guard at the palace.</p>
 <p>Consecration and deification of emperors testify to the unrepublican position they occupied. Iulius Caesar had permitted himself to be regarded as a god, but Augustus refused to allow worship of himself, at least in Rome and Italy. Like Iulius Caesar, however, he was placed among the gods of Rome after death, and with his deified successors received the title <seg lang="la">divus.</seg> Temples were built in Asia to Augustus and Tiberius during their lives, and the tendency to deify living emperors prevailed generally during the latter half of the second century.</p>
 <p>Augustus and the early emperors endeavoured to follow republican principles in the natural dignifying and honouring of members of their families. Livia was an exception in the privileges she obtained (Dio Cass. xlix. 38), but at her death honours were restricted and deification was at first denied ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 5. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>v. 2</bibl>). The title Augusta was conferred upon Livia by the will of Augustus, perhaps with some political significance; but though from the time of Domitian it was regularly given to the wife of the reigning prince, it became a general title of honour, being granted also to other relatives of the <seg lang="la">princeps.</seg> Later the wife of the reigning emperor was still more highly honoured by the granting of the appellation <seg lang="la">mater castrorum</seg>, e. g., 
<pb n="1315" /><cb />
 to Faustina, wife of Marcus Aurelius, and <seg lang="la">mater castrorum et senatus et patriae</seg> to Iulia Domna, wife of Severus. The young men were made <seg lang="la">principes iuventutis</seg>, a title merely signifying entrance into the equestrian order, and whatever rank they obtained came through the holding of magistracies perhaps at an unusually early age, a favour granted, however, by a special decree alone. Notwithstanding this moderation on the part of the early emperors, there is a persistent endeavour to glorify the imperial family. In the <seg lang="la">votorum nuncupatio</seg> (Wilmanns, 2876) we find the <seg lang="la">tota domus</seg> associated with the names of the emperor Domitian, of Domitia and Iulia (Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 776), and the phrase <title>tota domus Augusta</title> occurs in an inscription of the time of Hadrian (Wilm. 319), while <title>numina Augusti totiusque domus divinae</title> is seen in an inscription of the time of Commodus (Wilm. 120), and mention of the <seg lang="la">domus divina</seg> is very common thereafter (Momm. <title>Staatsr.</title> ii. 780-81).</p>
 <p>As with his family, so with his associates and friends, Augustus endeavoured to prevent intimate relations with the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> from implying undue influence and power ( <bibl n="Suet.

It was inevitable, however, that the preëminence of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> should result in an exaggeration of the standing of those who had the honour of his friendship. The morning receptions, similar to those of other prominent citizens, became with the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> the gatherings of magistrates and senators (Friedländer, <title>Sittengeschichte</title> I. ch. ii.). The <title>amici Caesaris</title> developed under Tiberius into a distinct and semi-official body (<seg lang="la">cohors</seg>) ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 6. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>vi. 9</bibl>), arranged in classes with rank determined by degree of intimacy. The <seg lang="la">renuntiatio amicitiae</seg> on the part of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> was equivalent to sentence of banishment ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>56</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 2. 70" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>ii. 70</bibl>; iii. 12<bibl n="Tac.

Tib. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>46</bibl>). After the first century <seg lang="la">amici</seg> became a general term, and included the regular attendants upon the emperor as well as any of high rank who were especially favoured. The term <seg lang="la">comes</seg> becomes more definite in its application, referring to those assigned to expeditions. These were supplied with special camp-quarters, and had precedence over provincial governors. A proof of the value assigned to appointment as <seg lang="la">comes</seg> is found in the appearance of the title in the inscriptions among the <seg lang="la">honores</seg> (Friedländer, <title>Sittengeschichte</title>, i. 118 foll.). At first the agents of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> belonged strictly to his own household, and were either slaves or freedmen. The necessity of having a body of imperial representatives led to the formation of the equestrian <seg lang="la">cursus honorum.</seg> From a select class of the <seg lang="la">equites</seg> the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> selected administrative officers, who were his agents, while the magistrates of the senatorial order were the officers of the State. The equestrian <seg lang="la">cursus honorum</seg> was introduced by a military service, which led to procuratorships of various grades and finally to the important praefectures. These imperial officers formed an organized service, which, spreading throughout the Empire, supplanted in many instances the representatives of the State, and brought the control of the provinces directly into the hands of the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg>, centralizing the governmental control in Caesar, and making him in this respect also a monarch.

 <p> (1) A Latin grammarian of Caesarea, in Mauritania, who lived, at the beginning of the sixth century A.D., as a teacher of the Latin language in Constantinople.

This work, which is of great importance owing to its ample quotations from ancient literature, was for a long time, in the Middle Ages, the school-book in ordinary use in the shape of an epitome by Rabanus Maurus, and formed the foundation for the earlier treatises on Latin grammar in modern times. We also possess an insipid panegyrical poem written by Priscian on the emperor Anastasius, a translation of the Cosmography of the geographer Dionysius, in hexameter verse, besides a grammatical catechism on twelve lines of the <title>Aeneid</title> for school use, a treatise on accent, a treatise on declension, a treatise on symbols for coins and weights, a treatise on the metres of Terence, a translation of the <foreign lang="greek">Προγυμνάσματα</foreign> (<title>Praeexercitamenta</title>) of Hermogenes, a poem <title>De Sideribus</title>, and two epigrams.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">προβολή</foreign>). A motion for a judicial prosecution. In Attic legal procedure it was a particular kind of public indictment. In the first assembly of every prytany, on the archon's inquiring whether the people were satisfied with the conduct of the magistrates, any citizen might accuse a magistrate of official misconduct. If the assembly considered there was foundation for the charge, the magistrate was temporarily suspended or even absolutely deposed from his office, and a judicial prosecution was instituted. Even against a private citizen, especially for doing an injury to magistrates, or to sacred persons or things, for interrupting a festival, embezzling public money, or instituting a vexatious prosecution, a complaint could be brought before the people in order to see whether they considered the case suitable for a judicial trial. The most celebrated example of this procedure is the case of Demosthenes against Midias for assaulting him in the discharge of public functions at the Dionysia. However, this neither bound the man who laid the complaint to bring forward an actual indictment nor the jury to follow in the formal trial the preliminary verdict of the people, although it would always influence them. <cb />

 <p>A Roman emperor (A.D. 276-282). He was a native of Sirmium in Pannonia, and rose to distinction by his military abilities. He was appointed, by the emperor <ref type="cross" target="crosstacitus">Tacitus, governor of the whole East, and, upon the death of that sovereign, the purple was forced upon his acceptance by the armies of Syria. The downfall of Florianus</ref> (q.v.) speedily removed his only rival, and he was enthusiastically hailed by the united voice of the Senate, the people, and the legions. The reign of Probus presents a series of the most brilliant achievements. He defeated the barbarians on the frontiers of Gaul and Illyricum and in other parts of the Roman Empire, and put down the rebellions of Saturninus at Alexandria, and of Proculus and Bonosus in Gaul. But, after crushing all external and internal foes, he was killed at Sirmium by his own soldiers, who had risen in mutiny against him, because he had employed them in laborious public works. Probus was as just and virtuous as he was warlike, and is deservedly regarded as one of the greatest and best of the Roman emperors. His life is given in the Historia Augusta; see also Zosim. i. 64.

<head orig="Proclus">Proclus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρόκλος</foreign>). The most important representative of the later Neo-Platonic School, born A.D. 412 at Byzantium. He received his first instruction at Xanthus, in Lycia, and betook himself 
<pb n="1317" /><cb /> to Alexandria to complete his education. There he attached himself chiefly to Heron, the mathematician, and to the Aristotelian Olympiodorus. Before the age of twenty, he removed to Athens to attend the lectures of the most celebrated Platonists of the time, Syrianus and Plutarchus. On the death of the latter he became head of the Platonic School until his own death in 485. His disciples were very numerous; and his learning and zeal for the education of the young, combined with his beneficence, his virtuous and strictly ascetic life, and his steadfastness in the faith of his fathers, gained him the enthusiastic devotion of his followers. We possess an account of his life, full of admiration for his character, by his pupil and successor, Marinus. The efforts of Proclus were directed to the support of paganism in its struggle with the now victorious Christianity, by reducing to a system all the philosophic and religious traditions of antiquity. His literary activity was very great, and extended over almost every department of knowledge; but Platonic philosophy was the centre of the whole. His philosophical works, now extant, are a commentary on a few dialogues of Plato (mainly on the <title>Timaeus</title>), also his chief work on the theology of Plato, as well as a summary of the theology of Plotinus, with writings treating several branches of philosophy from his own point of view. Some of his minor works have reached us only in a Latin translation. As specimens of his mathematical and astronomical works, we have a commentary on the first book of Euclid, a sketch of the astronomical teaching of Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and others, a slight treatise on the heavens, etc. One of his grammatical writings survives in his commentary on Hesiod's <title>Works and Days.</title> Lastly, we have two epigrams by him and six hymns. It is doubtful whether the <title>Grammatical Chrestomathy</title>, extracts from which, preserved by Photius, are the only source of our knowledge of the Greek cyclic poets, was really written by him, and not rather by a grammarian of the same name in the second century A.D.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρόκνη</foreign>). A daughter of the Athenian king Pandion and Zeuxippé, sister of Philomela. She was given in marriage by her father to the Thracian prince Tereus, in Daulis near Parnassus, in return for assistance given him in war. Tereus became by her the father of Itys. Pretending that his wife Procné was dead, Tereus brought her sister Philomela from Athens, and ravished her on the way. He then cut out her tongue that she might be unable to inform against him, and concealed her in a grove on Parnassus; but the unfortunate girl contrived to inform her sister of what had happened by a robe, into which she ingeniously wove the story of her fate. Taking the opportunity of a feast of Dionysus in Parnassus, Procné went in quest of her sister, and agreed with her on a bloody revenge. They slew the boy Itys, and served him up to his father to eat. When Tereus learned the outrage, and was on the point of slaying the sisters, the gods changed him into a hoopoe or hawk, Procné into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow, or (according to another version) Procné into a <cb /> swallow, and Philomela into a nightingale.

<head orig="Proconsul">Proconsul</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνθύπατος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">pro consule</seg>, “deputy-consul”). A Roman officer to whom the consular power was intrusted for a specified district outside the city. The regular method of appointing the proconsul was to prolong the official power of the retiring consul (<seg lang="la">prorogatio imperii</seg>) on the conclusion of his year of office. In exceptional cases, however, others were appointed proconsuls, generally those who had already held the office of consul. This was especially done to increase the number of generals in command. The proconsuls were appointed for a definite or indefinite period; as a rule for a year, reckoned from the day on which they entered their province. This period might be prolonged by a new prorogation. In any case the proconsul continued in office till the appearance of his successor. With the growth of the provinces, the consuls as well as the praetors were employed to administer them as proconsuls on the expiration of their office. After Sulla this became the rule; indeed, the Senate decided which provinces were to be consular and which praetorian. The regulation, in B.C. 53, that past consuls should not govern a province till five years after their consulship broke down the immediate connection between the consulship and succession to a province, and the proconsuls thereby became in a more distinctive sense governors of provinces. After Augustus the title was given to governors of senatorial provinces, whether they had held the consulship before or not. As soon as the proconsul had been invested with his official power (<seg lang="la">imperium</seg>), he had to leave Rome forthwith, for there his <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> became extinct. Like the consuls, he had twelve lictors with bundles of rods and axes, whom he was bound to dismiss on reëntering Rome. In the province he combined military and judicial power over the subject peoples and the Roman citizens alike—only that in the case of the latter, on a capital charge, he had to allow them to appeal to Rome. To administer justice he travelled in the winter from town to town. In the case of war he might order out the Roman citizens as well as the provincials. His power was absolutely unlimited, so that he might be guilty of the greatest oppression and extortion, and was only liable to prosecution for these offences on the expiration of his office. He might advance a claim for a triumph or an <seg lang="la">ovatio</seg> (q. v.) for military services. When the senatorial provinces came generally to have no army under the Empire, the duties of the proconsuls became limited to administration, political and judicial. See Mommsen, <title>Röm.

In the senatorial provinces, also, there was an imperial procurator, independent of the governor, to manage the domains and to collect the revenues belonging to the <seg lang="la">fiscus.</seg> Further, there were particular provinces which, before they were administered as actual provinces, were governed as domains by an administrator appointed by the emperor and personally responsible to him. He likewise was styled procurator, and in general had a position similar to that of the other governors. Such a procurator was Pontius Pilate in Judaea, which for a long time was under a procurator. The imperial chief treasury was administered by a <seg lang="la">procurator a rationibus</seg>, also called <seg lang="la">procurator fisci</seg>, at first an imperial freedman, but after the second century a knight ( <title>Vitell.</title> 2). To administer the imperial privy purse, into which flowed the revenues from the crown lands and the private fortune of the emperor, there were special procurators.

<div2 id="crossprodicus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Prodĭcus">Prodicus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρόδικος</foreign>). A Greek Sophist of Ceos, contemporary with Socrates. He repeatedly visited Athens as an ambassador from his native country. The applause which his speeches gained there induced him to come forward as a rhetorician. In his lectures on literary style he laid chief stress on the right use of words and the accurate discrimination between synonyms, and thereby paved the way for the dialectic discussions of Socrates (Plato, <bibl n="Plat.

<head orig="Prodigium">Prodigium</head>

 <p> The Latin term for an unnatural or, at any rate, unusual and inexplicable phenomenon, which was always treated as requiring expiation (<seg lang="la">procuratio</seg>). This was only done on behalf of the State, if the phenomenon had been observed on ground belonging to the State. The Senate, acting on the advice of the pontiffs, ordained either particular sacrifices, to specified deities, or a nine days' sacrifice, or a public intercession, and left the execution of the ordinance to the consuls (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 20</bibl>). If a prodigium caused so much alarm that the usual means of expiation seemed insufficient, the Senate had recourse to the Sibylline Books, or the Etruscan <seg lang="la">haruspices.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossharuspex">Haruspex</ref>; Sibylla.)

<head orig="Proetus">Proetus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Προῖτος</foreign>). Son of Abas and Ocalé, and twin-brother of Acrisius. In the dispute between the two brothers for the kingdom of Argos Proetus was expelled, whereupon he fled to Iobatos, in Lycia, and married Antea or Stheneboea, the daughter of the latter. With the assistance of Iobates, Proetus was restored to his kingdom, and took Tiryns, which was now fortified by the Cyclopes. Acrisius then shared his kingdom with his brother, surrendering to him Tiryns, Midea, and the coast of Argolis. By his wife, Proetus became the father of three daughters, Lysippé, Iphinoë, and Iphianassa, who are often mentioned under the general name of <ref type="cross" target="crossproetides">Proetĭdes</ref>. When these daughters arrived at the age of maturity, they were stricken with madness, the cause of which is differently explained. Some say that it was a punishment inflicted upon them by Dionysus, because they had despised his worship; others relate that they were driven mad 
<pb n="1319" /><cb />
 by Heré, because they presumed to consider themselves more handsome than the goddess, or because they had stolen some of the gold of her statue. The frenzy spread to the other women of Argos; till at length Proetus agreed to divide his kingdom between Melampus and his brother Bias , upon the former promising that he would cure the women of their madness. Melampus then chose the most robust among the young men, gave chase to the mad women, amid shouting and dancing, and drove them as far as Sicyon. During this pursuit, Iphinoë died, but the two other daughters were cured by Melampus by means of purifications, and were then married to Melampus and Bias. The place where the cure was effected upon his daughters is not the same in all traditions, some mentioning the well Anigros, others the fountain Clitor in Arcadia, or Lusi in Arcadia. Besides these daughters, Proetus had a son, Megapenthes. When Bellerophon came to Proetus to be purified of a murder which he had committed, the wife of Proetus fell in love with him; but, as Bellerophon declined her advances, she charged him before Proetus with having made improper proposals to her. Proetus then sent Bellerophon to Iobates in Lycia, with a letter desiring the latter to murder Bellerophon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbellerophon">Bellerophon</ref>.) According to Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 5. 238" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>v. 238</bibl>) Acrisius was expelled from his kingdom by Proetus; and Perseus, the grandson of Acrisius, avenged his grandfather by turning Proetus into stone by means of the head of Medusa.

 <p> The name in the Roman centuriate system (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>) of those citizens who were placed in the lowest of the five property classes, and who were exempt from military service and tribute. Their name owes its origin to the fact that they only benefited the State by their children (<seg lang="la">proles</seg>). Another name for them is <seg lang="la">capite censi</seg>— i. e. those who were classed in the list of citizens at the census solely in regard to their status as citizens (<seg lang="la">caput</seg>). Afterwards, the richer among them were taken to serve in the wars: these were then called <seg lang="la">proletarii;</seg> and those without any property at all, <seg lang="la">capite censi.</seg> In and after the time of Marius, when the levy of troops was no longer founded on the census, the Roman armies were recruited by preference from the last class.

<div2 id="crossprologus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Prolŏgus">Prologus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πρόλογος</foreign>). A technical term applied to that part of a Greek drama which precedes the entrance of the first chorus. From the time of Euripides it came to mean a monologue containing a narrative of the facts introductory to the main action, and this is the meaning which the word possessed in the language of Roman comedy. It is thus opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίλογος</foreign>, the concluding part of the play. Aristotle compares the prologue to the prelude in a piece of music ( <bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 3. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title>iii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Rhet., 1</bibl>). The word is also applied to the actor who speaks the Prologue. In some plays there are two speakers of this sort— e. g. in the <title>Alcestis</title> of Euripides and the <title>Trinummus</title> of Plautus. Terence uses the Prologue as a means of personal communication on the part of the author to the public and as a vehicle for replying to adverse criticism (e. g. in the <title>Andria</title>). (See Liebig, <title>De Prologis Terentianis et Plautinis</title> [Görlitz, 1859].) The tables of contents prefixed to the divisions of books are also called <cb /> <seg lang="la">prologi</seg>, as those of the lost history of Pompeius Trogus.

<div2 id="crossprometheus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Promētheus">Prometheus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Προμηθεύς</foreign>, “forethought”). A son of the Titan Iapetus and the Ocean-nymph Clymené, brother of Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus, father of <ref type="cross" target="crossdeucalion">Deucalion</ref> (q.v.). The most ancient account of him, as given by Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 521-616) is as follows: When the gods, after their conquest of the Titans, were negotiating with mankind about the honour to be paid them, Prometheus was charged with the duty of dividing a victim offered in sacrifice to the gods. He endeavoured to impose upon Zeus by dividing it in such a way as cleverly to conceal the half which consisted of flesh and the edible vitals under the skin of the animal, and to lay thereon the worst part, the stomach, while he heaped the bones together and covered them with fat.</p>
 <p>Zeus divined the stratagem, but, out of enmity towards man, purposely chose the worst portion, and avenged himself by refusing mortals the use of fire. Thereupon Prometheus stole it from Olympus and brought it to men in a hollow reed (<foreign lang="greek">νάρθηξ</foreign>). As a set-off to this great blessing, Zeus resolved to send them an equally great evil. He caused Hephaestus to make of clay a beautiful woman named Pandora—that is, the all-gifted; for the gods presented her with all manner of charms and adornments, coupled however with lies, flattering words, and a crafty mind. Hermes brought her, with a jar as her dowry, in which every evil was shut up, to the brother of Prometheus, named Epimetheus (i. e. the man of afterthought, for he never thought of what he did until it had brought him into trouble). In spite of his brother's warning not to receive any present from Zeus, he was ensnared by her charms and took her to wife. Pandora opened the jar, and out flew all manner of evils, troubles, and diseases, before unknown to man, and spread over all the earth. Only delusive Hope remained in the jar, since, before she could escape, Pandora put the lid on the jar again ( <title>Op. et D.</title> 54-105). But Prometheus met with his punishment. Zeus had him bound in adamantine fetters to a pillar with an eagle to consume in the day-time his liver, which grew again in the night. At last Heracles, with the consent of Zeus, who desired to increase his son's renown, killed the eagle, and set the son of Iapetus free. According to this account, the guile of Prometheus, and his opposition to the will of Zeus, brought on man far more evil than good.</p>
 <p>Aeschylus, on the other hand, taking the view suggested by the Attic cult of Prometheus, in which the fire-bringing god was honoured as the founder of human civilization, gave the myth an entirely different form in his trilogy of <title>Prometheus the Fire-bearer, Prometheus Bound</title>, and <title>Prometheus Released.</title> In these Prometheus is still, of course, the opponent of Zeus; but, at the same time, he is 
<pb n="1320" /><cb />
 represented as full of the most devoted love for the human race. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaeschylus">Aeschylus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Aeschylus makes him son of Themis, by whom he is put in possession of all the secrets of the future. In the war with the Titans, his advice assisted Zeus to victory. But when the god, after the partition of the world, resolved on destroying the rude human race, and to create other beings in their stead, Prometheus alone concerned himself with the fate of wretched mortals, and saved them from destruction. He brought them the fire he had stolen from Hephaestus at Lemnos, the fire that was to become the source of all discoveries and of mastery over nature; and raised them to a higher civilization by his inventive skill and by the arts which he taught mankind. For this he was punished by being chained on a rock beside the sea in the wilds of Scythia. Oceanus advised him to bend beneath the might of Zeus; but he consoled himself with the knowledge that, if the god begat a son by a certain goddess known to himself alone (Thetis), the son would dethrone his father. When no menaces could tear from him the secret, Zeus hurled him with a thunderbolt into Tartarus together with the rock to which he was chained. From this abode he first emerged into the light of day a long time after, to be fastened on Mount Caucasus and torn by the eagle until another immortal voluntarily entered Hades for him. At last Heracles, on his journey to the Hesperides, shot the eagle; the centaur <ref type="cross" target="crosschiron">Chiron</ref> (q.v.), suffering from his incurable wound, gladly renounced his immortality; and, after Prometheus had revealed the name of the goddess, he was set free. But, as a sign of his punishment, he ever after bore on his finger an iron ring and on his head a willow crown. He returned to Olympus, and once more became adviser and prophet of the gods. Legends related that he moulded men and animals of clay, and either animated these himself with the heavenly fire or induced Zeus or Athené to do so (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 81" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>i. 81</bibl>;  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 16</bibl><bibl n="Hor.

In Athens Prometheus shared with Hephaestus a common altar in the Academy, in the sacred precinct of Athené, and was honoured with a torchrace in a yearly festival called the Prometheia. There are monographs on the myth of Prometheus, by Weiske <bibl default="NO">(1842)</bibl>; Lasaulx <bibl default="NO">(1843)</bibl>; Holle <bibl default="NO">(1879)</bibl>; and Milchhöfer <bibl default="NO">(1882)</bibl>; see also <bibl default="NO">Kuhn, <title>Die Herabkunft des Feuers</title> (1886)</bibl>; and E.

 <head><surname full="yes">Propertius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Sextus</foreName>
 <p>A Roman elegiac poet born at Asisium (Assisi), in Umbria ( <bibl n="Prop.  1. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop.i. 22</bibl><bibl n="Prop.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 9</bibl><bibl n="Prop.  65" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 65</bibl>-66<bibl n="Prop.  121" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 121</bibl>-126, and v. 1). The date of his birth is uncertain. He was somewhat older than Ovid, and was probably born about B.C. 50. He lost his parents at an early age; and, through the general confiscation of land in 42, was deprived of the greater part of his paternal estate. Still, he possessed enough to live a typical poet's life at Rome, whither he had proceeded soon after coming of age, about B.C. 34. He there associated with his patron Maecenas and with other poets, such as Vergil and Ovid. To complete his studies he afterwards went to Athens. When he was still quite young, the poet's spirit woke within him, and expanded through his attachment to the beautiful and witty Hostia. Under the name Cynthia, she henceforth was the subject of his love-poems. For five years (B.C. 28-23) this attachment lasted, though often disturbed by the jealousy of the sensitive poet and the capriciousness of his mistress. When it had come to an end, and even after Cynthia's death (probably before B.C. 18), the poet could not forget his old passion. He himself died young. He often expresses forebodings of an early death; there is no indication in his poems that any of them were written later than B.C. 16. They have come down to us in four books, but some scholars are of opinion that the poet himself had divided them into five, and that the original second and third books have been united, perhaps through the oversight of friends at the publication of the last. Propertius himself seems to have only published the first. In the first four books amatory poems preponderate. The fifth book, the confused order of which may well be referred to the poet's untimely death, deals mainly with subjects taken from Roman legends and history, in the same way as Ovid subsequently treated them in the <title>Fasti.</title></p>
 <p>Propertius possesses a poetical genius with which his talent is unable to keep pace. Endowed with a nature susceptible of passion as deep as it was strong, as ardent as it was easily evoked, and possessed of a rich fancy, he strives to express the fulness of his thoughts and feelings in a manner modelled closely on that of his Greek masters; and yet in his struggle with linguistic and metrical form, he fails to attain the agreeable in every instance. His expression is often peculiarly harsh and difficult, and his meaning is frequently obscured by far-fetched allusions to unfamiliar legends, or actual transcripts of them. Herein he follows the example of his models, the Alexandrian poets, Callimachus and Philetas. Nevertheless he is a great poet, and none of his countrymen has depicted the fire of passion so truly and so vividly as he. The personality of Propertius seems not to have been altogether agreeable, but to have been characterized by a certain conceit and youthful bumptiousness; and editors have argued with some probability that he is the person whom 
<pb n="1321" /><cb /> Horace had in mind in depicting the famous bore in the ninth satire of the First Book, though there are some chronological difficulties in the way of this theory. See Palmer's notes on this satire.</p>
 <p>The principal manuscript of Propertius is the Codex Neapolitanus, now at Wolfenbüttel, which dates from the fifteenth century, though long regarded as older. See the introduction to L. Müller's critical edition <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1880)</bibl>. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> of Propertius appeared at Venice in 1472.

<head orig="Propylaeum, Propylaea">Propylaeum, Propylaea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">προπύλαιον, προπύλαια</foreign>). (The singular and plural forms seem not to have differed in meaning. The gateway to the Athenian acropolis went almost invariably under the name <foreign lang="greek">Προπύλαια</foreign>, but it is called <foreign lang="greek">Προπύλαιον</foreign> in a contemporary official inscription (<title>C. I. A.</title> i. 314). The elder Pliny uses <hi rend="italic">propylon</hi> for the same structure.) A gate-building, serving generally as an entrance to a sacred precinct. A city-gate is never so called.</p>
 <p>The most important edifice of this kind, both architecturally and historically, and also the best preserved, is that designed by Mnesicles, and built in the years B.C. 437-432, as an entrance to the Athenian acropolis. The material is chiefly Pentelic marble; black Eleusinian marble is sparingly used for thresholds, wall-bases, etc.; the foundations are, in part, of Piraeus limestone (<seg lang="la">poros</seg>). The diagram shows the ground-plan both as originally designed and as actually carried out. (The unshaded parts were not built.) The central and essential part of the structure consists of two parallel lateral walls terminating in antae; a cross-wall, placed much nearer the eastern than the western front, and pierced by five doorways of three different widths; and two Doric hexastyle porticos, the greater or western one of which included six Ionic columns, placed three on each side of the central passage-way, and helping to support the flat ceiling. The whole was completely roofed over. The central and broadest of the five doorways was intended for processions, for animals, and perhaps also for wheeled vehicles; the other four, designed for ordinary pedestrians, were approached from the west by five steps. Each of the five doorways was provided originally with double doors. The central structure thus far described constituted the Propylaea proper. To this Mnesicles designed extensive wings, the like of which are not found with any other known Propylaea. Of these wings, only one, the northwestern, was carried out according to the design. This consists of a rectangular closed chamber and a Doric portico, whose three columns are much smaller than those of the central structure. The chamber was entered by a door in its south wall. On either 
<pb n="1322" /><cb />
 side of the door was a window. Pausanias speaks of this northwestern wing as “a building to the left of the Propylaea containing pictures,” whence it is often called the Pinacotheca by modern writers. The southwestern wing was to have been of the same dimensions as the northwestern, but of a different plan, with an open row of columns towards the west in place of a closed wall. This project had to be greatly changed; it is probable that unexpected opposition was raised to the destruction of a piece of venerable Pelasgic wall, and to encroachment on the precinct of Athena Niké. As a result this wing became a shrunken and abnormal structure, with a free-standing double anta at the northwestern corner and a unique form of roof. Again, Mnesicles designed two great porticos flanking the Propylaea and fronting eastward. These were both given up, the one probably because it would have encroached upon the precinct of Artemis Brauronia, the other perhaps in consequence of the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Even those parts of the whole edifice which were actually erected did not everywhere receive the finishing touch. The most obvious evidence of this is the existence of numerous rough bosses on the exposed surfaces of the marble blocks. These bosses were for assistance in hoisting the blocks, and were intended to be subsequently worked off.</p>
 <p>The Propylaeum of Mnesicles was a building of great originality and skill, and, though it lacks something of the perfect simplicity and harmony of a Doric temple of the same period, it must still be ranked as one of the greatest achievements of Greek architecture. The artistic forms are admirable, the Ionic capitals being especially noteworthy for combined vigour and refinement; the workmanship is of unsurpassed precision. The juxtaposition of different orders, necessitated by the greater height required for the interior columns, is by some considered unfortunate. There is a similar juxtaposition in the temple of Athené Alea at Tegea, where the columns of the peristyle were Doric and those of the pronaos and opisthodomos Corinthian (probably). Owing to the width required for the principal entrance-way, the central intercolumniations on the east and west fronts are much greater than the others, with the result that there are two triglyphs instead of one over the central intercolumniations. This asymmetry would not be found in a temple. In consequence of the rise of the ground, the eastern pediment is nearly one and a half metres higher than the western. This superposition would have been very disagreeable if seen, but must have been invisible from most of the possible points of view. See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>, p. 155 (illustration).</p>
 <p>The Propylaeum of Mnesicles was built on the site of an earlier and smaller structure of the same sort, of which slight traces can still be seen. Other remains of propylaea exist at Eleusis, Epidaurus, Olympia, Delos, and Priené.</p>

 <p> A celebrated ecclesiastical writer. He was a native of Aquitania, and flourished during the first half of the fifth century A.D. He distinguished himself by his numerous writings in defence of the doctrines of Augustine against the attacks of the Semipelagians. Many of his theological works are extant; and there are also two chronicles bearing his name: (1) <title>Chronicon Consulare</title>, extending from A.D. 379, the date at which the chronicle of St. Jerome ends, down to 455, the events being arranged according to the years of the Roman consuls. We find short notices with regard to the Roman emperors, the Roman bishops, and political occurrences in general; but the troubles of the Church are especially dwelt upon, and, above all, the Pelagian heresy.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Chronicon Imperiale</title>, comprehended within the same limits as the preceding (379-455), but the computations proceed according to the years of the Roman emperors, and not according to the consuls. While it agrees with the <title>Chronicon Consulare</title> in its general plan, it differs from it in many particulars, especially in the very brief allusions to the Pelagian controversy, and in the slight, almost disrespectful notices of Augustine. The second of these chronicles was probably not written by Prosper of Aquitania, and is assigned by most critics to Prosper Tiro , who, it is imagined, flourished in the sixth century. There are likewise several poems, which have come down to us under the name of Prosper. The best edition of Prosper's works is that of Lebrun and Maugeant <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1711)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossprotagoras" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Protagŏras">Protagoras</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρωταγόρας</foreign>). A celebrated Sophist, born at Abdera, in Thrace, probably about B.C. 480, and died about 411, at the age of nearly seventy years. It is said that Protagoras was once a poor porter, and that the skill with which he had fastened together, and poised upon his shoulders, a large bundle of wood, attracted the attention of Democritus, who conceived a liking for him, took him under his care, and instructed him in philosophy ( <bibl n="Diog.  9. 53" default="NO">Diog. Laert.ix. 53</bibl>; x. 8; <bibl n="Gel.  5. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.v. 3</bibl>). This well-known story, however, appears to have arisen out of the statement of Aristotle that Protagoras invented a sort of porter's knot for the more convenient carrying of burdens. In addition to this, Protagoras was about twenty years older than Democritus. Protagoras was the first who called himself a Sophist, and taught for pay; and he practised his profession for the space of forty years. He must have come to Athens before B.C. 445, since he drew up a code of laws for the Thurians, who left Athens for the first time in that year. Whether he accompanied the colonists to Thurii, we are not informed; but at the time of the plague (430) we find him again in Athens. Between his first and second visit to Athens he had spent some time in Sicily, where he had acquired great fame; and he brought with him to Athens many admirers out of other Greek cities through which he had passed. His instructions were so highly valued that he sometimes received 100 minae from a pupil; and Plato says that Protagoras made more money than Phidias and ten other sculptors. In 411 he was accused of impiety by Pythodorus, one of the Four Hundred. His impeachment was founded on his book on the gods, which began with the statement, “Respecting the gods, I am unable to know whether they exist or do not exist” ( <bibl n="Diog.  9. 52" default="NO">Diog. Laert.ix. 52</bibl>). The impeachment was followed by his banishment, or, as others affirm, only by the burning of his book. His doctrine was, in fact, a sort of agnosticism based upon the impossibility of attaining any absosolute criterion of truth. It is summed up in the sentence, “Man is the measure of all things” (<foreign lang="greek">πάντων ἄνθρωπος μέτρον</foreign>, or, in Latin, <seg lang="la">homo mensura omnium</seg>), implying that each one must be his own final authority; for just as each thing appears to any individual, so it really is for him. This doctrine is therefore styled Individualism. Protagoras wrote a large number of works, of which the most important were entitled <title>Truth</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀλήθεια</foreign>) and <title>On the Gods</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Θεῶν</foreign>). The first contained the theory refuted by Plato in the <title>Theaetetus.</title> Plato <cb /> gives a vivid picture of the teaching of Protagoras in the dialogue that bears his name. Protagoras was especially celebrated for his skill in the rhetorical art. By way of practice in the art he was accustomed to make his pupils discuss theses (<seg lang="la">communes loci</seg>), an exercise which is also recommended by Cicero. He also directed his attention to language, and endeavoured to explain difficult passages in the poets. He is said to have been the first to make the grammatical distinctions of moods in verbs and of genders in nouns.</p>

He led the warriors of several Thessalian towns against Troy, and was the first of all the Greeks who was killed by the Trojans, being the first who leaped from the ships upon the Trojan coast. According to the common tradition he was slain by Hector. Protesilaüs is most celebrated in ancient story for the strong affection existing between him and his wife Laodamia, the daughter of Acastus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslaodamia">Laodamia</ref>.) His tomb was shown near Eleus, in the Thracian Chersonesus, where a magnificent temple was erected to him. There was a belief that nymphs had planted elm-trees around his grave, which died away when they had grown sufficiently high to see Troy, and that fresh shoots then sprang from the roots. There was also a sanctuary of Protesilaüs at Phylacé, at which funeral games were celebrated.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρωτεύς</foreign>). The prophetic old man of the sea, described in the earliest legends as a subject of Poseidon, whose flocks (the seals) he tended. According to Homer, he resided in the island of Pharos at a distance of one day's sail from the river Aegyptus (i. e. the Nile); whereas Vergil places his residence in the island of Carpathos between Crete and Rhodes. At mid-day Proteus rose from the sea, and slept in the shadow of the rocks of the coast, with the sea-monsters lying around him. Any one wishing to learn from him the future was obliged to catch hold of him at that time; as soon as he was seized he assumed every possible shape in order to escape the necessity of prophesying; but whenever he saw that his endeavours were of no avail he resumed his usual form, and told the truth. After finishing his prophecy he returned into the sea (<title>Odyss.</title> iv. 351). Homer ascribes to him a daughter Idothea. Another set of traditions describes Proteus as a son of Poseidon and as a king of Egypt, who had two sons—Telegonus and Polygonus or Tmolus. His Egyptian name is said to have been Cetes, for which the Greeks substituted that of Proteus. His wife is called Psamathé or Toroné, and, besides the above-mentioned sons, Theoclymenus and Theonoë are likewise called his children. He is said to have hospitably received Dionysus during his wanderings.

He died B.C. 300. His poverty seems to have prevented him from attending the school of any of the celebrated masters of his age, for no one is named as his instructor. He long remained poor, until the unselfish admiration which his contemporary and brother painter Apelles showed for his works raised him in riper years to great celebrity. His works, owing to the excessive care he bestowed on them, were few in number; but their perfect execution led to their being ranked by the unanimous voice of antiquity among the highest productions of art. His most celebrated works were a “Resting Satyr,” and also a painting representing the Rhodian hero, Ialysus. On the latter he spent seven or, according to others, as many as eleven years.

<div2 id="crossprovincia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Provincia">Provincia</head>

 <p> A word which, in Roman public law, designated primarily the sphere of action allotted to a particular magistrate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>.) When, in the third century B.C., Rome began to assume the permanent rule of territories outside of Italy, it became customary to intrust the government of each such territory to a single magistrate; and, by a natural transition, “province” became the technical term for conquered territory ruled by a Roman governor, and “provincials” the technical term for the inhabitants <cb /> of such a territory—the subjects as distinguished from the citizens of Rome. Territories left under the sceptres of native princes, though practically controlled by Rome, were not provinces. Free and allied cities, though included within the boundaries of a province, were not parts of the province, nor were individuals who had received Roman citizenship properly numbered among the provincials. In the imperial period, however, with the gradual disappearance of the protected kingdoms and allied commonwealths and the gradual extension of Roman citizenship throughout the Roman world, the term province became purely territorial; the provinces were simply the great governmental districts outside of Italy. At the same time, in consequence of the growth of imperial absolutism, the distinction between Italy and the provinces lost all real importance. As early as the second century after Christ, the methods of provincial administration were introduced into Italy; and under Diocletian, at the close of the third century, the distinction disappeared even in name, Italy being divided into a number of provinces.</p>
 <p><title>Provincial Officers.</title>—Provision was made for the government of the first four provinces by increasing the number of praetors annually elected at Rome (so B.C. 227 and again B.C. 197). The praetors-elect drew lots to determine which should do duty in Rome and which should go to the provinces. With the increase in the number of provinces (B.C. 146-120) the Senate began to prolong (<seg lang="la">prorogare</seg>) the imperium of outgoing magistrates, who then ruled the provinces allotted them as <seg lang="la">pro</seg>consuls or <seg lang="la">pro</seg>praetors. The more important provinces—those in which military operations were in progress or in prospect—were commonly assigned to the outgoing consuls. A <title>lex Sempronia</title> (C. Gracchus) provided that the Senate should indicate annually, before the election of the consuls, which provinces were to be assigned to them. The consuls-elect then drew lots for these provinces. The system of governing the provinces through such promagistrates was made general by Sulla (about B.C. 80). The new criminal courts (<seg lang="la">quaestiones</seg>) established by him, together with the older civil courts, kept all the praetors (now eight in number) busy at Rome during their first year of office, and all the provinces (now ten in number) were allotted to proconsuls or propraetors. The consuls continued to draw lots for the consular provinces before taking office: the praetors drew lots during their year of office. With the further increase in the number of provinces (B.C. 64 there were fourteen or fifteen) recourse was had to various expedients. Two or more provinces were not infrequently assigned to a single proconsul, or a proconsul or propraetor was left in his province for two or more years. Exceptionally, an outgoing praetor or even a private citizen might be invested with proconsular powers, but only by a vote of the Comitia. Iulius Caesar restored the equilibrium between the urban magistracies and the provincial promagistracies by a further increase in the number of praetors.</p>
 <p>Under Augustus a division of provinces was made between the emperor and the Senate. He reserved to himself those provinces in which it was necessary to maintain a considerable armed force, and assigned to the Senate those which 
<pb n="1325" /><cb />
 were pacified. The senatorial provinces (ten in number) continued to be allotted to the ex-magistrates: Africa and Asia to ex-consuls, the rest to ex-praetors. All of the senatorial governors bore the title of proconsul, but those of consular rank had twelve fasces, those of praetorian rank but six. With the multiplication of the city magistracies and the decrease in the number of available provinces, governorships were no longer obtainable by the outgoing magistrates at the expiration of their regular terms, but only after a legal interval of five years, and then in the order of seniority. Under Tiberius the actual interval averaged about thirteen years.</p>
 <p>Under the governors served: (1) <title>Legati</title>, lieutenants, usually nominated by the governor and appointed by the Senate. The governor assigned to them their duties, and had the power of dismissing them (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslegatus">Legatus</ref>);</p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">comites</seg> or <seg lang="la">contubernales</seg>, a staff of military and administrative assistants, appointed by the governor with the approval of the Senate, and removable at his pleasure;</p>
 <p>(3) <seg lang="la">apparitores</seg>, etc., secretaries, clerks, copyists, interpreters, attendants and messengers, engineers (<seg lang="la">architecti</seg>), physicians, and priests. All these (with the possible exception of the <seg lang="la">medici</seg>) were public employés, paid by the treasury. The governor might also take with him, at his own expense, as many clients and slaves as he saw fit; but until late in the republican period he was not permitted to take his wife.</p>
 <p>The provincial quaestors, or treasury officials, were magistrates of subordinate rank, but of independent tenure and powers. They were elected, not appointed; and were responsible only to the treasury and the Senate. The number of quaestors annually elected at Rome had increased with the organization of new provinces, so that, even at the close of the republican period, the quaestors-elect drew lots for Italian or provincial duty, and proquaestors were rarely needed. Under the Empire these officials were gradually replaced by imperial procurators (q. v.).</p>
 <p>The quaestors, legates, and <seg lang="la">comites</seg> constituted the governor's council. See <seg lang="la">consilia</seg>, under <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the provinces of Caesar the emperor himself was proconsul. The governors were his appointees and lieutenants, <title>legati Augusti pro praetore.</title> Their authority was as ample as that of a proconsul, but since it was a delegated authority they had but five fasces (<seg lang="la">legati quinquefascales</seg>). Their military aids (<seg lang="la">legati legionis</seg>) and their officers of justice (<seg lang="la">legati iuridici</seg>) were appointed by the emperor. The interests of the imperial fiscus were guarded by procurators.</p>
 <p>Early in the imperial period there appears another type of imperial province, in which the emperor rules not as proconsul, but as sovereign proprietor, and not through a <seg lang="la">legatus</seg>, but through a viceroy (<seg lang="la">praefectus</seg>) or steward (<seg lang="la">procurator</seg>). Many of these provinces were ruled for a time by tributary kings or princes, and with the extinction or deposition of the original dynasty the resident procurator of Caesar becomes <seg lang="la">procurator et praeses</seg> or <seg lang="la">procurator pro legato.</seg> In nearly all of these provinces there was some obstacle, either in the temper of the inhabitants (as in Egypt and Iudaea) or in the topography (as in the Alps), or in the backward stage of civilization (as in Thrace and Mauretania) to the introduction of the ordinary provincial administration. <cb /></p>
 <p><title>Organization and Government.</title>—In the republican period the main lines of the provincial organization were fixed by the Senate, and the details were worked out in each province by a special committee of senatorial legates. The constitution thus framed was the <seg lang="la">lex provinciae.</seg> The normal unit of local government was the city or town. If there were no cities, local government districts were created by combining several villages or even, as in Spain and Gaul, by adopting the existing tribal districts. In such districts towns gradually grew up, sometimes about a marketplace, sometimes about a Roman garrison. In other cases the nuclei of municipal organizations were furnished by Roman colonies. The effect of Roman rule was gradually to develop, where it did not previously exist, the Graeco-Latin municipal system. This development was largely due to the method of government instinctively adopted. It was always the Roman practice, while maintaining a strong central control, to leave the immediate management of local affairs to the local authorities, and to throw upon them as much of the provincial and even of the imperial business as they could manage—particularly the conscription of soldiers and the collection of taxes. Only where there were no trustworthy local authorities was a prefecture or local dictatorship established. In the imperial period municipal self-government was secured and enlarged, in proportion as the provinces were Romanized, by special charters and general laws. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmunicipium">Municipium</ref>.</p>
 <p>For the administration of justice the provinces were divided into much larger districts or dioceses (<seg lang="la">conventus</seg>). To the municipalities was left only a petty civil and criminal jurisdiction.</p>
 <p>In the original demarkation of the municipal districts and judicial circuits the Romans retained the older native divisions only where the people submitted readily to the Roman rule. Where this was not the case the older political or racial connections were purposely severed; hostile communes were placed under the rule of those more friendly to Rome or under that of Roman colonies, and <seg lang="la">connubium</seg> and even <seg lang="la">commercium</seg> were suspended between different portions of the same province. But the Romans made no such innovations for the sake of innovation, or even for the sake of uniformity.</p>
 <p>In the government of a province the governor was subject to no limitations except those expressly imposed by Roman legislation. In theory the provincials had no political or religious organization, no law, and no rights. They were conquered subjects of the Roman people (<seg lang="la">dediticii</seg>), holding their lives and their property at the pleasure of Rome. The authority of the governor was in principle absolute: he had <seg lang="la">imperium militiae.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmagistratus">Magistratus</ref>.) Upon the exercise of his governmental power, however, certain restrictions were imposed, at first by Roman tradition and custom, and later, in many cases, by written law. In criminal matters he was sole judge of the law and the facts, but he was expected to administer criminal justice publicly and at stated places and times, to hear evidence and argument, and to consult his councillors. In the exercise of his civil jurisdiction he was expected, after hearing the pleadings and discovering the point at issue, to refer the decision to a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> or <seg lang="la">arbiter.</seg> 
<pb n="1326" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the absence of any provincial law (for the provincials had lost their own law and had no share in the civil law of Rome) he was obliged to lay down the rules which the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> was to apply; but this he was expected (and ultimately required) to do in a general way, by a public edict, at the beginning of his term of office. He was bound to adhere to his own edict, and his successor generally reënacted it, with such emendations and additions as seemed advisable. These provincial edicts were, in general, admirably drawn, and they constituted an important element in the development of the <seg lang="la">ius gentium.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossedictum">Edictum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossius">Ius</ref>.</p>
 <p>Such special laws as were passed at Rome for the protection of the provincials were intended primarily to safeguard the proprietary interest of the Roman people, to prevent the governors from so impairing the resources of the provinces as to lessen their value to Rome. By a series of laws the governors were forbidden to extort money or goods from the provincials, directly or indirectly. They were forbidden to accept gifts, and to purchase anything beyond current supplies. For oppression and maladministration they were liable to criminal indictment after their return to Rome. Such charges were originally tried by the Senate; then by a standing committee of the Senate; later by a regular court with a large bench of <seg lang="la">iudices (quaestio repetundarum).</seg> The governors were also expected to protect the provincials against the tax-farmers (<seg lang="la">publicani</seg>) and the speculators (<seg lang="la">negotiatores</seg>), but as a rule governors, publicans, and speculators acted in concert. When the provincials were unable to meet the exactions of the governor and the publicans, the speculators advanced the necessary sums at usurious interest; and if their loans were not repaid when due, troops were placed at their disposal for the collection of principal and interest. The transfer of the <seg lang="la">iudicia</seg> from the senatorial to the equestrian order (C. Gracchus) tended to force the governors into such a concert, because the publicans and speculators belonged to, and exercised a controlling influence in, the equestrian order. The short terms allotted to the provincial governors made their robberies more rapid, and the prospect of criminal prosecution forced them to steal on a larger scale that they might purchase their acquittal at Rome without sacrificing more than the moiety of their gains. That the governors should make their fortunes out of the provinces was so much a matter of course that the few honourable exceptions were matters of special note and record. Even the free and allied cities were not secure against robbery by the provincial ring. Some of them paid subsidies, which brought them into relations with the publicans and speculators: nearly all of them were bound to furnish recruits and, in case of need, to provide free quarters for the legions, which placed them at the mercy of the governor. The sale of protection against the quartering of troops was an important source of illegal revenue.</p>
 <p>The establishment of the Empire greatly improved the position of the provincials. The theory that the provinces must not be so exploited as to lessen their productivity was now enforced, not only in the provinces of Caesar, but in those which were nominally under the control of the Senate. A careful census of the provinces and the abandonment of the wasteful and oppressive system of tax-farming made it possible to lessen the burden <cb /> of the provincial taxes and yet increase the revenue. All the provincial governors, including the proconsuls, received not only their outfit and a liberal allowance for expenses, as in the Republican period, but a salary. The extension of municipal rights and of Roman citizenship gave the provincials much more effective protection against arbitrary and unjust treatment. The systematic organization of the cult of Rome and of the <title>divi Augusti</title> led to annual meetings of delegates from the localities, and to these assemblies (<seg lang="la">communia, concilia</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">κοινά</foreign>), whose character and duties were at first purely religious, some representative functions were conceded, especially the right of petition. Under Tiberius they became something very like advisory administrative councils. Charges against the governors formulated by such bodies received serious consideration. Tacitus and Pliny mention twenty-seven trials of ex-governors, with but seven acquittals.</p>
 <p><title>Public Works.</title>—Even under the Republic much had been done to develop the resources of the provinces by the building of roads, the improvement of harbours, the establishment of colonies, etc. Under the Empire all these things were done on a larger scale and with more consistency of purpose. For an account of the imperial postal system, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscursus-publicus">Cursus Publicus</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Defence of the Frontiers.</title>—With the pacification and gradual Romanization of the provinces the troops were gradually removed to the frontier. The frontier line (<seg lang="la">limes</seg>), even in those portions most exposed to barbarian inroads, was a road rather than a wall, and served primarily for the rapid concentration of troops. These were quartered in forts (<seg lang="la">castella</seg>). The road itself was protected, where it was deemed necessary, by ditches and palisades, and frequently by a broad zone of waste country, in which no settlements were tolerated. The movement of persons across the line was strictly controlled, as was also, for revenue purposes, the transit of goods.</p>
 <p><title>General Development.</title>—In judging the results of Roman conquest and rule, it must never be forgotten that the suppression of brigandage and piracy, and of the interminable wars which formerly raged between the petty States of the ancient world, gave to industry and commerce an unexampled security, which went far to balance the spoliation of the provinces even in the worst period of misgovernment. With the administrative reforms of the early Empire and the effective defence of the frontiers, the majority of the provinces grew rapidly in wealth, comfort, and civilization. The contributions of the ruder, non-Hellenic provinces to the art, literature, and science of the Roman world grew steadily in importance. Provincials played a prominent part in the government of the Empire: they gave it not only the bulk of its troops, but a constantly increasing number of military leaders, administrative officers, and jurists. In the end they furnished the majority of its emperors.</p>
 <p><title>Later Empire.</title>—In the course of the third century the military and the civil government of the provinces began to be assigned to different officers, the former to <seg lang="la">duces</seg>, the latter to <seg lang="la">praesides</seg> or <seg lang="la">correctores.</seg> Under Diocletian this separation of powers became general. At the same time the larger provinces were subdivided and grouped for administrative purposes into a dozen dioceses, each under a <seg lang="la">vicarius</seg>, and these, again, into four great prefectures—Gaul, Italy, Illyricum, and the Orient.

<head orig="Provocatio">Provocatio</head>

 <p> The Roman term for the appeal from the verdict of the magistrate to the decision of the people.</p>
 <p>Under the kings the court of appeal was the Comitia Curiata; after Servius Tullius, the Comitia Centuriata. While, under the arbitrary rule of the kings, the right of appeal was allowed, on the establishment of the Republic, in B.C. 509, this was imposed on the consuls as a duty, and was repeatedly enjoined by special enactments in all cases where it was a question of life and death, or of corporal punishment. The appeal was only valid within the city, and the Pomerium, but not in the camp. Moreover, no one could appeal against the dictator. When afterwards (B.C. 454), besides the <cb /> consuls, the tribunes and aediles acquired the right of imposing a fine (<seg lang="la">multa</seg>, q. v.), a maximum limit was fixed for it, and if that was exceeded, there was an appeal to the Comitia Tributa.</p>
 <p>As this appeal was expected in all legitimate cases, trials of this kind were held immediately before the Comitia concerned with such appeals; and after the verdict had been pronounced by the magistrate presiding, it was either confirmed or reversed by the votes of the people. About B.C. 195 the right of appeal was extended over the whole of Italy and the provinces. After permanent courts for certain offences had been established, the <seg lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossquaestio">Quaestio</ref>), the jurisdiction of the people, and with it the appeal thereto, became more and more limited.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πρόξενος</foreign>). The Greek term for the representative of a State who was appointed, from the citizens of another State, to attend to the interests of its citizens there resident, as often as they needed legal protection and assistance. In the interests of foreigners, many States appointed such representatives from among their own citizens. Their position may be compared with that of our consuls. The <hi rend="italic">proxenus</hi> received many distinctions and honours from the State which he represented. To be nominated <hi rend="italic">proxenus</hi> was in some cases only an honorary distinction, which the State conferred on such foreigners as resided in it as aliens (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmetoeci">Metoeci</ref>), and were therefore unable to do any service abroad for the citizens of the State in which they resided. This distinction insured many privileges, such as freedom from taxation and from public burdens which otherwise fell on the resident aliens, and, in general, exemption from tolls and taxes; also the right to acquire property in land, free admission to the Senate and to the assemblies of the people, etc. See <bibl default="NO">Monceaux, <title>Les Proxenies Grecques</title> (1886)</bibl>.

 <p>The earliest of the Christian poets of any celebrity. He was a native of Spain, and was born A.D. 348. After practising as an advocate, and discharging the duties of a civil and criminal judge in two important cities, he received from the emperor Theodosius, or Honorius, a high military appointment at court; but as he advanced in years he became sensible of the emptiness of worldly honour and earnest in the exercises of religion. His poems are composed in a great variety of metres, and are brilliant in style and in the fervour of their Christian sentiment. The Latinity, for its period, is good; and his metrical skill surpasses that of his pagan contemporaries.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Προυσίας</foreign>). (1) I. King of Bithynia from about B.C. 228 to 180, though the date neither of his accession nor of his death is exactly known. He was the son of Zielas, whom he succeeded. He appears to have been a monarch of vigour and ability, and raised his kingdom of Bithynia to a much higher pitch of power and prosperity than it had previously attained. It was at his court that Hannibal took refuge; and when the Romans demanded the surrender of the Carthaginian general, the king basely gave his consent, and Hannibal only escaped falling into the hands of his enemies by a voluntary death.</p>
 <p>(2) II. King of Bithynia, son and successor of the preceding, reigned from about B.C. 180 to 149. He courted assiduously the alliance of the Romans. He carried on war with Attalus, king of Pergamus, with whom, however, he was compelled by the Romans to conclude peace in 154. He was slain in 149 by order of his son Nicomedes, as is related in the life of the latter. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnicomedes">Nicomedes II</ref>.) Prusias is described to us as a man in whom personal deformity was combined with a character the most vicious and degraded.

Iulius Africanus calls him <hi rend="SmallCaps">Psammecherītes</hi>. He was the son and successor of Amasis, and ascended the throne at the very moment that Camhyses was marching against Egypt to dethrone the father. Psammenitus met Cambyses on the frontiers, near the Pelusiac hranch of the Nile, with all his forces—Egyptians, Grecks, and Carians—but was totally defeated in a bloody battle. Shutting himself up in Memphis, he was besieged here by Cambyses, and, according to Ctesias, was finally betrayed and taken prisoner. All Egypt thereupon fell under the Persian power, and the reign of Psammenitus ended after a duration of only six months. The greatest outrages were heaped upon the unfortunate monarch and his family; but the firmness with which he endured them all touched at last even the ferocious Cambyses with compassion. Psammenitus was thereupon retained at court, treated with honour, and finally sent to Susa along with 6000 Egyptian captives. Having been accused, however, subsequently, of attempting to stir up a revolt, he was compelled to drink bull's blood, and ended his days ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 10</bibl> foll.).

<div2 id="crosspsammetichus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Psammetĭchus">Psammetichus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ψαμμήτιχος</foreign>). (1) The first king of Egypt who opened that country to strangers, and induced the Greeks to come and settle in it. He was the fourth in the Saïtic dynasty, and the son of Necos or Nechao, who had been put to death by the Aethiopians, at that time masters of Egypt. Psammetichus, being quite young at the time of his father's death, had been carried into Syria to avoid a similar fate, and, after the retreat of the conquerors, was recalled to his native country by the inhabitants of the Saïtic nome. It would seem that the Aethiopians, on their departure, had left Egypt a prey to trouble and dissension, and that the early princes of the Saïtic dynasty, also, had never enjoyed supreme control over the whole kingdom. When Psammetichus, therefore, ascended the throne, he was obliged to share his power with eleven other monarchs, and Egypt was thus divided into twelve independent sovereignties. This form of government was like what <cb /> the Greeks called a “dyodecarchy” (<foreign lang="greek">δυοδεκαρχία</foreign>). The twelve kings regulated in common, in a general council, all that related to the affairs of the kingdom considered as a whole. This state of things lasted for fifteen years, when it met with a singular termination. An oracle had declared that the whole kingdom would fall to the lot of that one of the twelve monarchs who should one day offer a libation with a brazen cup. It happened, then, one day, that the kings were all sacrificing in common in the temple of Hephaestus at Memphis, and that the high priest, who distributed the golden cups for libations, had brought with him, by some accident, only eleven. When it came, therefore, to the turn of Psammetichus, who was the last in order to pour out a libation, he unthinkingly employed for this purpose his brazen helmet. This incident occasioned great disquiet to his colleagues, who thought they saw in it the fulfilment of the oracle. Being nuable, however, with any appearance of justice, to punish an unpremeditated act, they conteuted themselves with banishing him to his own kingdom, which lay on the coast, and with forbidding him to take any part thereafter in the general affairs of the country. Psammetichus, however, retaliated upon them by calling to his aid some Greek mercenaries who had landed on the Egyptian shore, and eventually conquered all his colleagues, and made himself master of the whole of Egypt (B.C. 652). The monarch now recompensed his Greek allies not only by paying them the sums of money which he had promised, but also in assigning them lands on the Syrian frontier, where they formed, in fact, a military colony. Psammetichns showed a great partiality for the Greeks on all occasions; and, in a Syrian expedition, gave them the place of honour on the right, while he assigned the left to the Egyptians. The discontent of the national troops was so great at this that a large number of the military caste, amounting, it is said, to 240,000 men, left Egypt and retired to Aethiopia. So strong was the preference of Psammetichus for everything Greek that he caused a number of children to be trained up after the Grecian manner, and with these he formed the body of interpreters, whom Herodotus found in his day existing in Egypt. Psammetichus also embellished his capital with several beautiful structures, and, among others, with the southern propylaea of the great temple of Hephaestus. He carried on a long war in Syria, and his forces are said to have remained twenty-nine years before the city of Azotus. It was during this period, probably, that he arrested by presents the victorious career of the Scythians, who had overrun Asia Minor, and were advancing upon Palestine and Egypt (B.C. 626). Psammetichus died after a reign of fifty-four years, leaving the crown to his son Necos.</p>
 <p>Herodotus relates a curious story of Psammetichus, who, it seems, was desirous of ascertaining what nation was the most ancient in the world; or, in other words, what was the primitive language of men. In order to discover this, he took two newly born children, and, having caused them to be placed in a lonely hut, directed a shepherd to nourish them with the milk of goats, which animals were sent in to them at stated times, and to take care himself never to utter a word in their hearing. The object was to ascertain what words 
<pb n="1331" /><cb />
 they would first utter of themselves. At length, on one occasion, when the shepherd went in to them as usual, both the children, running up to him, called out <hi rend="italic">bekos.</hi> Psammetichus, on being informed of the circumstance, made inquiries about the word, and found that it was the Phrygian term for bread. He therefore concluded that the Phrygians were the most ancient of men ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 151" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 151</bibl> foll.).

Psyché was the youngest of the three daughters of a king, and excited by her beauty the jealousy and envy of Venus. In order to avenge herself, the goddess ordered Cupid or Eros to inspire Psyché with a love for the most contemptible of all men; but Cupid was so stricken with her beauty that he himself fell in love with her. He accordingly conveyed her to a charming spot, where, unseen and unknown, he visited her every night, and left her as soon as the day began to dawn. Psyché might have continued to enjoy this state of happiness if she had attended to the advice of her lover, who told her never to give way to her curiosity, or to inquire who he was. But her jealous sisters made her believe that in the darkness of night she was embracing some hideous monster, and accordingly once, while Cupid was asleep, she drew near to him with a lamp, and, to her amazement, beheld the most handsome and lovely of the gods. In her excitement of joy and fear, a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp upon his shoulder. This awoke Cupid, who censured her for her mistrust, and escaped. Psyché's happiness was now gone, and after attempting in vain to throw herself into a river, she wandered about from temple to temple, inquiring after her lover, and at length came to the palace of Venus. There her real sufferings began, for Venus retained her, treated her as a slave, and imposed upon her the hardest and most humiliating labours. Psyché 
<pb n="1332" /><cb />
 would have perished under the weight of her sufferings, had not Cupid, who still loved her in secret, invisibly comforted and assisted her in her toils. With his aid she at last succeeded in overcoming the jealousy and hatred of Venus: she became immortal, and was united to him forever. Many have tried to see in this lovely story an idea of which it is said to be the mythical embodiment; that Psyché is the human soul, which is purified by passions and misfortunes, and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure happiness. The story, however, is only a variation of an IndoEuropean folk-tale found among many peoples. See <bibl default="NO">Zingow, <title>Psyche und Eros</title> (1881)</bibl>. It forms an episode in the <title>Metamorphoses</title> of Apuleius (iv. 28- vi. 24), and is borrowed by him from a Greek original. This episode is separately edited by Jahn and Michaelis <bibl default="NO">(3d ed. Leipzig, 1883)</bibl>. See Jahn in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Populäre Aufsätze</title> (Bonn, 1868)</bibl>; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crossapuleius">Apuleius</ref>. In works of art Psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings of a butterfly, along with Cupid in the different situations described in the allegory.

</figure> erally believed that Ptolemy was in reality the offspring of that monarch. Ptolemy is mentioned among the friends of the young Alexander before the death of Philip. He accompanied Alexander throughout his campaigns in Asia, and was always treated by the king with the greatest favour. On the division of the Empire which followed Alexander's death (323), Ptolemy obtained the government of Egypt. 
<pb n="1333" /><cb /> In 321 his dominions were invaded by Perdiccas, the regent; but the assassination of Perdiccas by his mutinous soldiers soon delivered Ptolemy from this danger. In the following year Ptolemy enlarged his dominions by seizing upon the important satrapy of Phoenicia and Coele-Syria. It was probably during this expedition that he made himself master of Jerusalem by attacking the city on the Sabbath. A few years afterwards (316) Ptolemy entered into an alliance with Cassander and Lysimachus against Antigonus, whose growing power had excited their common apprehensions. In the war which followed, Antigonus conquered Coele-Syria and Phoenicia (315-314); but Ptolemy recovered these provinces by the defeat of Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in 312. In 311 hostilities were suspended by a general peace. This peace, however, was of short duration, and Ptolemy appears to have been the first to recommence the war. He crossed over to Greece, where he announced himself as the liberator of the Greeks, but effected little. In 306 Ptolemy was defeated by Demetrius in a great sea-fight off Salamis in Cyprus. In consequence of this defeat, Ptolemy lost the important island of Cyprus, which had previously been subject to him. Antigonus was so much elated by this victory as to assume the title of king, an example which Ptolemy, notwithstanding his defeat, immediately followed. Antigonus and Demetrius followed up their success by the invasion of Egypt, but were compelled to return to Syria without effecting anything. Next year (305) Ptolemy rendered the most important assistance to the Rhodians, who were besieged by Demetrius; and when Demetrius was at length compelled to raise the siege (304), the Rhodians paid divine honours to the Egyptian monarch as their saviour and preserver (<foreign lang="greek">Σωτήρ</foreign>), a title which appears to have been now bestowed upon Ptolemy for the first time. Ptolemy took comparatively little part in the contest, which led to the decisive battle of Ipsus, in which Antigonus was defeated and slain (301). The latter years of Ptolemy's reign appear to have been devoted almost entirely to the arts of peace, and to promoting the internal prosperity of his dominions. In 285 Ptolemy abdicated in favour of his youngest son Ptolemy Philadelphus, the child of his latest and most beloved wife, Berenicé, excluding from the throne his two eldest sons Ptolemy Ceraunus and Meleager, the offspring of Eurydicé. The elder Ptolemy survived this event two years, and died in 283. His reign is variously estimated at thirty-eight or forty years, according as we include or not these two years which followed his abdication.</p>
 <p>The character of Ptolemy has been generally represented in a very favourable light by historians, and there is no doubt that if we compare him with his contemporaries and rivals he appears to deserve the praises bestowed upon his mildness and moderation. But it is only with this important qualification that they can be admitted: for there are many evidences that he did not shrink from any measure that he deemed requisite in order to carry out the objects of his ambition. Yet as a ruler Ptolemy certainly deserves the highest praise. By his able and vigorous administration he laid the foundations of the wealth and prosperity which Egypt enjoyed for a long <cb /> period. Under his fostering care Alexandria quickly rose to the place designed for it by its founder —that of the greatest commercial city of the world. Not less eminent were the services rendered by Ptolemy in the advancement of literature and science. In this department, indeed, it is not always easy to distinguish the portion of credit due to the father from that of his son: but it seems certain that to the elder monarch belongs the merit of having originated those literary institutions which assumed a more definite and regular form, as well as a more prominent place, under his successor. Such appears to have been the case with the two most celebrated of all—the Library and the Museum of Alexandria. The first suggestion of these important foundations is ascribed by some writers to Demetrius of Phalerus, who spent all the latter years of his life at the court of Ptolemy. But many other men of literary eminence were also gathered around the Egyptian king, among whom may be especially noticed the great geometrician Euclid, the philosophers Stilpo of Megara, Theodorus of Cyrené, and Diodorus surnamed Cronus, as well as the elegiac poet Philetas of Cos, and the grammarian Zenodotus. To the last two we are told Ptolemy confided the literary education of his son Philadelphus. Many anecdotes sufficiently attest the free intercourse which subsisted between the king and the men of letters by whom he was surrounded, and prove that the easy familiarity of his manners corresponded with his simple and unostentatious habits of life. We also find him maintaining a correspondence with Menander, whom he in vain endeavoured to attract to his court, and sending overtures probably of a similiar nature to Theophrastus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbibliotheca">Bibliotheca</ref>.) Nor were the fine arts neglected: the rival painters Antiphilus and Apelles both exercised their talents at Alexandria, where some of their most celebrated pictures were produced. See <bibl default="NO">Mahaffy, <title>The Empire of the Ptolemies</title> (1896)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Ptolemy was himself an author: he composed a history of the wars of Alexander, which is frequently cited by later writers, and is one of the chief authorities which Arrian made the groundwork of his own history.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crossphiladelphus">Philadelphus</ref> (B.C. 285-247), the son of Ptolemy I. by his wife Berenicé, was born in the island of Cos, 309. His long reign was marked by few events of a striking character. He was engaged in war with his half-brother Magas, who had governed Cyrené as viceroy under Ptolemy Soter, but on the death of that monarch not only asserted his independence, but even attempted to invade Egypt. Magas was supported by Antiochus II., king of Syria; and the war was at length terminated by a treaty, which left Magas in undisputed possession of the Cyrenaïca, while his infant daughter Berenicé was betrothed to Ptolemy, the son of Philadelphus. Ptolemy also concluded a treaty with the Romans. He was frequently engaged in hostilities with Syria, which were terminated towards the close of his reign by a treaty of peace, by which Ptolemy gave his daughter Berenicé in marriage to Antiochus II. Ptolemy's chief care, however, was directed to the internal administration of his kingdom, and to the patronage of literature and science. The institutions of which the foundations had been laid by his father quickly rose under 
<pb n="1334" /><cb /> his fostering care to the highest prosperity. The Museum of Alexandria became the resort and abode of all the most distinguished men of letters of the day, and in the library attached to it were accumulated all the treasures of ancient learning. Among the other illustrious names which adorned the reign of Ptolemy may be mentioned those of the poets Philetas and Theocritus, the philosophers Hegesias and Theodorus, the mathematician Euclid, and the astronomers Timocharis, Aristarchus of Samos, and Aratus. Nor was his patronage confined to the ordinary cycle of Hellenic literature. By his interest in natural history he gave a stimulus to the pursuit of that science, which gave birth to many important works, while he himself formed collections of rare animals within the precincts of the royal palace. It was during his reign also, and perhaps at his desire, that Manetho gave to the world in a Greek form the historical records of the Egyptians; and according to a well-known tradition it was by his express command that the Holy Scriptures of the Jews were translated into Greek. The new cities or colonies founded by Philadelphus in different parts of his dominions were extremely numerous. On the Red Sea alone we find at least two bearing the name of Arsinoë, one called after another of his sisters Philotera, and two cities named in honour of his mother Berenicé. The same names occur also in Cilicia and Syria: and in the latter country he founded the important fortress of Ptolemaïs in Palestine. All authorities concur in attesting the great power and wealth to which the Egyptian monarchy was raised under Philadelphus. He possessed at the close of his reign a standing army of 200,000 foot and 40,000 horse, besides war-chariots and elephants, a fleet of 1500 ships, and a sum of 740,000 talents in his treasury; while he derived from Egypt alone an annual revenue of 14,800 talents. His dominions comprised, besides Egypt itself, and portions of Aethiopia, Arabia, and Libya, the important provinces of Phoenicia and Coele-Syria, together with Cyprus, Lycia, Caria, and the Cyclades, and during a great part at least of his reign Cilicia and Pamphylia also. Before his death Cyrené was reunited to the monarchy by the marriage of his son Ptolemy with Berenicé, the daughter of Magas. The private life and relations of Philadelphus do not exhibit his character in as favourable a light as we might have inferred from the splendour of his administration. He put to death two of his brothers; and he banished his first wife Arsinoë, the daughter of Lysimachus, to Coptos in Upper Egypt on a charge of conspiracy. After her removal Ptolemy married his own sister Arsinoë, the widow of Lysimachus, a flagrant violation of the religious notions of the Greeks, but one which was frequently imitated by his successors. He evinced his affection for Arsinoë not only by bestowing her name upon many of his newly-founded colonies, but by assuming himself the surname of Philadelphus, a title which some writers referred in derision to his unnatural treatment of his two brothers. By this second marriage Ptolemy had no issue: but his first wife had borne him two sons—Ptolemy, who succeeded him on the throne, and Lysimachus; and a daughter, Berenicé, whose marriage to Antiochus II., king of Syria, has been already mentioned.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crosseuergetes">Euergētes</ref> (B.C. 247-222), eldest son and successor of Philadelphus. <cb /> Shortly after his accession he invaded Syria, in order to avenge the death of his sister Berenicé. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossberenice">Berenicé</ref>, No. 2.) He met with the most striking success. He advanced as far as Babylon and Susa, and after reducing Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and Susiana, received the submission of all the upper provinces of Asia as far as the confines of Bactria and India. From this career of conquest he was recalled by the news of seditions in Egypt, and returned to that country, carrying with him an immense booty, comprising, among other objects, all the statues of the Egyptian deities which had been carried off by Cambyses to Babylon or Persia. These he restored to their respective temples, an act by which he earned the greatest popularity with his native Egyptian subjects, who bestowed on him in consequence the title of <foreign lang="greek">Ἑὐεργέτης</foreign> (“Benefactor”), by which he is generally known. While the arms of the king himself were thus successful in the East, his fleets reduced the maritime provinces of Asia, including Cilicia, Pamphylia, and Ionia, as far as the Hellespont, together with Lysimachia and other important places on the coast of Thrace which continued for a long period subject to the Egyptian rule. Concerning the events <figure id="fig.01334">
<head orig="Coin of Ptolemy Euergetes.">Coin of Ptolemy Euergetes.</head>
</figure> which followed the return of Euergetes to his own dominions (probably in 243) we are almost wholly in the dark; but it appears that the greater part of the eastern provinces speedily fell again into the hands of Seleucus, while Ptolemy retained possession of the maritime regions and a great part of Syria itself. He soon obtained a valuable ally in the person of Antiochus Hierax, the younger brother of Seleucus, whom he supported in his wars against his elder brother. We find Euergetes maintaining the same friendly relations as his father with Rome. During the latter years of his reign he subdued the Aethiopian tribes on his southern frontier, and advanced as far as Adule, a port on the Red Sea, where he established an emporium, and set up an inscription commemorating the exploits of his reign. To a copy of this, accidentally preserved to us by an Egyptian monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes, we are indebted for much of the scanty information we possess concerning his reign.</p>
 <p>Ptolemy Euergetes is scarcely less celebrated than his father for his patronage of literature and science: he added so largely to the library at Alexandria that he has been sometimes erroneously deemed its founder. Eratosthenes, Apollonius Rhodius, and Aristophanes the grammarian flourished at Alexandria during his reign—sufficient to prove that the literature and learning of the Alexandrian school still retained their former eminence. By his wife Berenicé, who survived him, Euergetes left three children: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Ptolemy, his successor; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Magas; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Arsinoë, afterwards married to her brother Ptolemy Philopator. 
<pb n="1335" /><cb />
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Philopător</hi> (B.C. 222-205), eldest son and successor of Euergetes. He was very far from inheriting the virtues or abilities of his father, and his reign was the commencement of the decline of the Egyptian kingdom, which had been raised to such a height of power and prosperity by his three predecessors. Its beginning was stained with crimes of the darkest kind. He put to death his mother, Berenicé, and his brother, Magas, and his uncle Lysimachus, the brother of Euergetes. He then gave himself up without restraint to a life of indolence and luxury, while he abandoned to his minister Sosibius the care of all political affairs. The latter seems to have been as incapable as his master, and the kingdom was allowed to fall into a state of the utmost disorder, of which Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, was not slow to avail himself. In the first two campaigns (219, 218), Antiochus conquered the greater part of Coele-Syria and Palestine, but in the third year of the war (217), he was completely defeated by Ptolemy in person at the decisive battle of Raphia, and was glad to conclude a peace with the Egyptian monarch. On his return from his Syrian expedition, Ptolemy gave himself up more and more to every species of vice and debauchery. His mistress Agathoclea, and her brother Agathocles, divided with Sosibius the patronage and distribution of all places of honour or profit. Towards the close of his reign Ptolemy put to death his wife Arsinoë. <figure id="fig.01335">
<head orig="Coin of Ptolemy IV. Philopator.">Coin of Ptolemy IV. Philopator.</head>
</figure> His debaucheries shortened his life. He died in 205, leaving only one son, a child of five years old. We find Ptolemy following up the policy of his predecessors by cultivating the friendship of the Romans, to whom he furnished large supplies of corn during their struggle with Carthage. Plunged as he was in vice and debauchery, Philopator appears to have still inherited something of the love of letters for which his predecessors were so conspicuous. We find him associating on familiar terms with philosophers and men of letters, and especially patronizing the distinguished grammarian Aristarchus.
 </p>
 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossepiphanes">Epiphănes</ref> (B.C. 205-181), son and successor of Ptolemy IV. He was a child of five years old at the death of his father, 205. Philip, king of Macedonia, and Antiochus III. of Syria determined to take advantage of the minority of Ptolemy, and entered into a league to divide his dominions between them. In pursuance of this arrangement, Antiochus conquered Coele-Syria, while Philip reduced the Cyclades and the cities in Thrace which had still remained subject to Egypt. In this emergency the Egyptian ministers had recourse to the powerful intervention of the Romans, who commanded both monarchs to refrain from further hostilities, and restore all the conquered cities. In order to evade this demand without openly opposing the power of Rome, Antiochus concluded a treaty with Egypt, by which it was agreed that <cb /> the young king should marry Cleopatra , the daughter of Antiochus, and receive back the Syrian provinces as her dower. This treaty took place in 199, but the marriage was not actually solemnized until six years after. The administration of Egypt was placed in the hands of Aristomenes, a man who was every way worthy of the charge. As early, however, as 196, the young king was declared of full age, and the ceremony of his anacleteria, or coronation, was solemnized with great magnificence. It was on this occasion that the decree was issued that has been preserved to us in the celebrated inscription known as the <ref type="cross" target="crossrosetta-stone">Rosetta Stone</ref> (q.v.). a monument of great interest in regard to the internal history of Egypt under the Ptolemies, independent of its importance as having afforded the key to the discovery of hieroglyphics. In 193 the marriage of Ptolemy with the Syrian princess Cleopatra was solemnized at Raphia. Ptolemy, however, refused to assist his father-in-law in the war against the Romans, which was at this time on the eve of breaking out, and he continued steadfast in his alliance with Rome. But he derived no advantage from the treaty which concluded it, and Antiochus still retained possession of CoeleSyria and Phoenicia. As long as Ptolemy continued under the guidance and influence of Aristomenes, his administration was equitable and popular. Gradually, however, he became estranged from his able and virtuous minister, and threw himself more and more into the power of flatterers and vicious companions, until at length he was induced to rid himself of Aristomenes, who was compelled to take poison. Towards the close of his reign Ptolemy conceived the project of recovering Coele-Syria from Seleucus, the successor of Antiochus, and had assembled a large mercenary force for that purpose; but having, by an unguarded expression, excited the apprehensions of some of his friends, he was cut off by poison in the twentyfourth year of his reign and the twenty-ninth of his age (181). He left two sons, both named Ptolemy, who subsequently ascended the throne, under the names of Ptolemy Philometor and Euergetes II., and a daughter who bore her mother's name of Cleopatra. His reign was marked by the rapid decline of the Egyptian monarchy, for the provinces and cities wrested from it during his minority by Antiochus and Philip were never recovered, and at his death Cyprus and the Cyrenaïca were almost the only foreign possessions still attached to the crown of Egypt.

 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Philomētor</hi> (B.C. 181-146), eldest son and successor of Ptolemy V. He was a child at the death of his father in 181, and the regency was assumed during his minority by his mother Cleopatra , who, by her able administration, maintained the kingdom in a state of tranquillity. But after her death in 173, the chief power fell into the hands of Eulaeus and Lenaeus, ministers as corrupt as they were incapable, who had the rashness to engage in war with Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, in the vain hope of recovering the provinces of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia. But their army was totally defeated by Antiochus near Pelusium, and Antiochus was able to advance without opposition as far as Memphis, 170. The young king himself fell into his hands, but was treated with kindness and distinction, as Antiochus hoped by his means to make himself the master of Egypt. On learning the captivity of his brother, the young 
<pb n="1336" /><cb /> Ptolemy, who was then at Alexandria with his sister Cleopatra , assumed the title of king, under the name of Euergetes II., and prepared to defend the capital to the utmost. Antiochus hereupon laid siege to Alexandria, but he was unable to take the city, and withdrew into Syria, after establishing Philometor as king at Memphis, but retaining in his hands the frontier fortress of Pelusium. This last circumstance, together with the ravages committed by the Syrian troops, awakened Philometor, who had hitherto been a mere puppet in the hands of the Syrian king, to a sense of his true position, and he hastened to make overtures of peace to his brother and sister at Alexandria. It was agreed that the two brothers should reign together, and that Philometor should marry his sister Cleopatra. But this arrangement did not suit the views of Antiochus, who immediately renewed hostilities. The two brothers were unable to offer any effectual opposition, and he had advanced a second time to the walls of Alexandria, when he was met by a Roman embassy, headed by M. Popilius Laenas, who haughtily commanded him instantly to desist from hostilities. Antiochus did not venture to disobey, and withdrew to his own dominions in 168. Dissensions broke out between the brothers, and Euergetes expelled Philometor from Alexandria. Philometor repaired to Rome, and by the influence of the Roman Senate was reinstated in the sovereign power, Euergetes, however, receiving the territory of Cyrené as a separate kingdom. To Cyprus also he soon laid claim, and war broke out once more, ending in the defeat of Euergetes, who from that time remained content with Cyrené as a kingdom. The attention of Philometor appears to have been, from this time, principally directed to the side of Syria. Demetrius Soter having sought during the dissensions between the two brothers to make himself master of Cyprus, Ptolemy now supported the usurper Alexander Balas, to whom he gave his daughter Cleopatra in marriage (150). But when Ptolemy advanced with an army to the assistance of his son-in-law, Ammonius, the favourite and minister of Alexander, formed a plot against the life of Ptolemy; whereupon the latter took away his daughter Cleopatra from her faithless husband, and bestowed her hand on Demetrius Nicator, the son of Soter, whose cause he now espoused. In conjunction with Demetrius, Ptolemy carried on war against Alexander, whom he defeated in a decisive battle; but he died a few days afterwards in consequence of an injury which he had received from a fall from his horse in this battle (146). He had reigned thirty-five years from the period of his first accession, and eighteen from his restoration by the Romans. Philometor is praised for the mildness and humanity of his disposition. Polybius even tells us that not a single citizen of Alexandria was put to death by him for any political or private offence. On the whole, if not one of the greatest, he was at least one of the best of the race of the Ptolemies. He left three children: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) A son, Ptolemy, who was proclaimed king after his father's death, under the name Ptolemy Eupator, but was put to death almost immediately after by his uncle Euergetes. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) A daughter, Cleopatra , married first to Alexander Balas, then to Demetrius II. king of Syria; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Another daughter, also named Cleopatra , who was afterwards married to her uncle Ptolemy Euergetes. <cb />
 </p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Euergĕtes II</hi>. or <ref type="cross" target="crossphyscon">Physcon</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Φύσκων</foreign>), “BigBelly,” reigned B.C. 146-117. His history down to the death of his brother has been already given. In order to secure undisputed possession of the throne, he married his sister Cleopatra , the widow of his brother Philometor, and put to death his nephew Ptolemy, who had been proclaimed king under the surname of Eupator. A reign thus commenced in blood was continued in a similar spirit. Many of the leading citizens of Alexandria, who had taken part against him on the death of his brother, were put to death, while the populace were given up to the cruelties of his mercenary troops, and the streets of the city were repeatedly deluged with blood. Thousands of the inhabitants fled from the scene of such horrors, and the population of Alexandria was so greatly thinned that the king found himself compelled to invite foreign settlers from all quarters to re-people his deserted capital. At the same time that he thus incurred the hatred of his subjects by his cruelties, he rendered himself an object of their aversion and contempt by abandoning himself to the most degrading vices. In consequence of these, he had become bloated and deformed in person, and enormously corpulent, whence the Alexandrians gave him the nickname of Physcon, by which he is more usually known. His union with Cleopatra was not of long duration. He became enamoured of his niece Cleopatra (the offspring of his wife by her former marriage with Philometor), and he did not hesitate to divorce the mother, and receive her daughter instead, as his wife and queen. By this proceeding he alienated still more the minds of his Greek subjects; and his vices and cruelties at length produced an insurrection at Alexandria. Thereupon he fled to Cyprus, and the Alexandrians declared his sister Cleopatra queen (130). Enraged at this, Ptolemy put to death Memphitis, his son by Cleopatra , and sent his head and hands to his unhappy mother. But Cleopatra having been shortly afterwards expelled from Alexandria in her turn, Ptolemy found himself unexpectedly reinstated on the throne (127). His sister Cleopatra fled to the court of her elder sister Cleopatra , the wife of Demetrius II., king of Syria, who espoused the cause of the fugitive. Ptolemy, in revenge, set up against him a pretender named Zabinas or Zebina, who assumed the title of Alexander II. But the usurper behaved with such haughtiness to Ptolemy that the latter suddenly changed his policy, became reconciled to his sister Cleopatra , whom he permitted to return to Egypt, and gave his daughter Tryphaena in marriage to Antiochus Grypus, the son of Demetrius. Ptolemy died after reigning twenty-nine years from the death of his brother Philometor; but he himself reckoned the years of his reign from the date of his first assumption of the regal title in 170. Although the character of Ptolemy Physcon was stained by the most infamous vices, and by the most sanguinary cruelty, he still retained that love of letters which appears to have been hereditary in the whole race of the Ptolemies. He had in his youth been a pupil of Aristarchus, and not only courted the society of learned men, but was himself the author of a work called <foreign lang="greek">Ὑπομνήματα</foreign>, or memoirs, which extended to twenty-four books. He left two sons: Ptolemy, afterwards known as Soter II., and Alexander, both of whom subsequently ascended the throne of Egypt; and three daughters: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Cleopatra , 
<pb n="1337" /><cb />
 married to her brother Ptolemy Soter; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus Grypus, king of Syria; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Selené, who was unmarried at her father's death. To his natural son Ptolemy, surnamed Apion , he bequeathed by his will the separate kingdom of Cyrené.
 </p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Soter II.</hi>, and also <hi rend="SmallCaps">Philomētor</hi>, but more commonly called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lathȳrus</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lathūrus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Λάθουρος</foreign>), reigned B.C. 117-107, and also 89-81. Although he was of full age at the time of his father's death (117), he was obliged to reign jointly with his mother, Cleopatra , who had been appointed by the will of her late husband to succeed him on the throne. She was indeed desirous of associating with herself her younger son, Ptolemy Alexander; but since Lathyrus was popular with the Alexandrians, she was obliged to give way, and sent Alexander to Cyprus. After declaring Lathyrus king, she compelled him to repudiate his sister Cleopatra , of whose influence she was jealous, and to marry his younger sister Selené in her stead. After reigning ten years jointly with his mother, he was expelled from Alexandria by an insurrection of the people which she had excited against him (107). His brother Alexander now assumed the sovereignty of Egypt, in conjunction with his mother, while Lathyrus was able to establish himself in the possession of Cyprus. Cleopatra, indeed, attempted to dispossess him of that island also, but without success, and Ptolemy held it as an independent kingdom for the eighteen years during which Cleopatra and Alexander reigned in Egypt. After the death of Cleopatra and the expulsion of Alexander in 89, Ptolemy Lathyrus was recalled by the Alexandrians, and established anew on the throne of Egypt, which he occupied thenceforth without interruption till his death in 81. The most important event of this period was the revolt of Thebes, in Upper Egypt, which was still powerful enough to hold out for nearly three years against the arms of Ptolemy, but at the end of that time was taken and reduced to the state of ruin in which it has ever since remained. Lathyrus reigned in all thirty-five years and a half; ten in conjunction with his mother (117-107), eighteen in Cyprus (107-89), and seven and a half as sole ruler of Egypt. He left only one daughter, Berenicé, called also Cleopatra , who succeeded him on the throne; and two sons, both named Ptolemy, who, though illegitimate, became severally kings of Egypt and Cyprus.
 </p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Alexander I.</hi>, youngest son of Ptolemy VII., reigned conjointly with his mother Cleopatra from the expulsion of his brother Lathyrus, B.C. 107 to 90. In this year he assassinated his mother; but he had not reigned alone a year, when he was compelled by a general sedition of the populace and military to quit Alexandria. He, however, raised fresh troops, but was totally defeated in a sea-fight by the rebels; whereupon Lathyrus was recalled by the Alexandrians to Egypt, as has been already related. Alexander now attempted to make himself master of Cyprus, and invaded that island, but was defeated and slain. He left a son, Alexander, who afterwards ascended the throne of Egypt.
 </p>
 <p>(10) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Alexander II.</hi>, son of the preceding, was at Rome at the death of Ptolemy Lathyrus in 81. Sulla , who was then dictator, nominated the young Alexander (who had obtained a high place in his favour) king of Egypt, and sent him to take possession of the crown. It was, however, agreed, <cb /> in deference to the claims of Cleopatra Berenicé, the daughter of Lathyrus, whom the Alexandrians had already placed on the throne, that Alexander should marry her, and admit her to share the sovereign power. He complied with the letter of this treaty by marrying Cleopatra , but only nineteen days afterward caused her to be assassinated. The Alexandrians thereupon rose against their new monarch and put him to death.
 </p>
 <p>(11) <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysus">Dionȳsus</ref>, but more commonly known by the appellation of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aulētes</hi>, “the flute-player,” was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy Lathyrus. When the assassination of Berenicé and the death of Alexander II. had completed the extinction of the legitimate race of the Lagidae, Ptolemy was proclaimed king by the Alexandrians, B.C. 80. He was anxious to obtain from the Roman Senate their ratification of his title to the crown, but it was not till the consulship of Caesar (59) that he was able to purchase by vast bribes the desired privilege. He had expended immense sums in the pursuit of this object, which he was compelled to raise by the imposition of fresh taxes, and the discontent thus excited combining with the contempt entertained for his character, led to his expulsion by the Alexandrians in 58. Thereupon he proceeded in person to Rome to procure from the Senate his restoration. His first reception was promising; and he procured a decree from the Senate commanding his restoration, and intrusting the charge of effecting it to P. Lentulus Spinther, then proconsul of Cilicia. Meanwhile, the Alexandrians sent an embassy of one hundred of their leading citizens to plead their cause with the Roman Senate; but Ptolemy had the audacity to cause the deputies, on their arrival in Italy, to be waylaid, and the greater part of them murdered. The indignation excited at Rome by this proceeding produced a reaction: the tribunes took up the matter against the nobility; and an oracle was produced from the Sibylline Books forbidding the restoration of the king by an armed force. The intrigues and disputes thus raised were protracted throughout the year 56, and at length Ptolemy, despairing of a favorable result, quitted Rome in disgust, and withdrew to Ephesus. But in 55, A. Gabinius, who was proconsul in Syria, was induced, by the influence of Pompey, aided by the enormous bribe of 10,000 talents from Ptolemy himself, to undertake his restoration. The Alexandrians had in the meantime placed on the throne of Egypt Berenicé, the eldest daughter of Ptolemy, who had married Archelaüs, the son of the general of Mithridates, and they opposed Gabinius with an army on the confines of the kingdom. They were, however, defeated in three successive battles, Archelaüs was slain, and Ptolemy once more established on the throne (55). One of his first acts was to put to death his daughter Berenicé, and many of the leading citizens of Alexandria. He survived his restoration only three years and a half, during which time he was supported by a large body of Roman soldiers who had been left behind by Gabinius for his protection. He died in 51, after a reign of twenty-nine years from the date of his first accession. He left two sons, both named Ptolemy, and two daughters, Cleopatra and Arsinoë.
 </p>
 <p>(12) Eldest son of the preceding. By his father's will the sovereign power was left to himself and his sister Cleopatra jointly, and this arrangement was carried into effect without opposition (51). Auletes had also referred the execution of his will 
<pb n="1338" /><cb />
 to the Roman Senate, and the latter accepted the office, confirmed its provisions, and bestowed on Pompey the title of guardian of the young king. But the approach of the Civil War prevented them from taking any active part in the administration of affairs, which fell into the hands of a eunuch named Pothinus. It was not long before dissensions broke out between the latter and Cleopatra , which ended in the expulsion of the princess, after she had reigned in conjunction with her brother about three years (48). Hereupon she took refuge in Syria, and assembled an army, with which she invaded Egypt. The young king, accompanied by his guardians, met her at Pelusium, and it was while the two armies were here encamped opposite to one another that Pompey landed in Egypt, to throw himself as a suppliant on the protection of Ptolemy; but he was assassinated, by the orders of Pothinus, before he could obtain an interview with the king himself. Shortly after, Caesar arrived in Egypt, and took upon himself to settle the dispute between Ptolemy and his sister. But as Cleopatra 's charms gained for her the support of Caesar, Pothinus determined to excite an insurrection against Caesar. Hence arose what is usually called the Alexandrian War. Ptolemy, who was at first in Caesar's hands, managed to escape, and put himself at the head of the insurgents; but he was defeated by Caesar, and was drowned in an attempt to escape by the river (47).
 </p>
 <p>(13) The youngest son of Ptolemy Auletes. He was appointed by Caesar to reign jointly with Cleopatra after the death of his elder brother Ptolemy XII., 47; and although he was a mere boy, it was decreed that he should marry his sister, with whom he was thus to share the power. Both his marriage and his regal title were of course purely nominal; and in the year 43 Cleopatra put him to death.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. Other Kings</hi>.—(1) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Alorītes</hi>, that is, of Alorus, regent, or, according to some authors, king of Macedonia. He obtained the supreme power by the assassination of Alexander II., the eldest son of Amyntas, B.C. 367, but was, in his turn, assassinated by Perdiccas III., 364.</p>
 <p>(2) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossapion">Apion</ref>, king of Cyrené (117-96), was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy Physcon, king of Egypt, who left him by his will the kingdom of the Cyrenaïca. At his death in 96, Apion bequeathed his kingdom by his will to the Roman people. The Senate, however, refused to accept the legacy, and declared the cities of the Cyrenaïca free. They were not reduced to the condition of a province till near thirty years afterwards.</p>
 <p>(3) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ceraunus</hi>, king of Macedonia, the son of Ptolemy I., king of Egypt, by his second wife Eurydicé. When his father in B.C. 285 set aside the claim of Ceraunus to the throne and appointed his younger son Ptolemy Philadelphus his successor, Ceraunus repaired to the court of Lysimachus. After Lysimachus had perished in battle against Seleucus (281) Ptolemy Ceraunus was received by the latter in the most friendly manner; but shortly afterwards (280) he basely assassinated Seleucus, and took possession of the Macedonian throne. After reigning a few months he was defeated in battle by the Gauls, taken prisoner, and put to death.</p>
 <p>(4) Tetrarch of Chalcis in Syria, the son of Mennaeus. He appears to have held the cities of Heliopolis and Chalcis as well as the mountain district of Ituraea, from whence he was in the habit of infesting Damascus and the more wealthy parts of <cb /> Coelé-Syria with predatory incursions. He reigned from about 70 to 40, when he was succeeded by his son Lysanias.</p>
 <p>(5) King of Cyprus, the younger brother of Ptolemy Auletes, king of Egypt, being like him an illegitimate son of Ptolemy Lathyrus. He was acknowledged as king of Cyprus at the same time that his brother Auletes obtained possession of the throne of Egypt (B.C. 80). He had offended P. Clodius by neglecting to ransom him when he had fallen into the hands of the Cilician pirates; and accordingly Clodius, when he became tribune (53), brought forward a law to deprive Ptolemy of his kingdom, and reduce Cyprus to a Roman province. Cato , who had to carry into execution this nefarious decree, sent to Ptolemy, advising him to submit, and offering him his personal safety, with the office of high-priest at Paphos, and a liberal maintenance. But the unhappy king refused these offers, and put an end to his own life (57).</p>
 <p>(6) King of Epirus, the second son of Alexander II., king of Epirus, and Olympias, and grandson of the great Pyrrhus. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his elder brother, Pyrrhus II., but reigned only a very short time. The date of his reign cannot be fixed with certainty, but as he was contemporary with Demetrius II., king of Macedonia, it may be placed between 239 and 229.</p>
 <p>(7) King of Mauretania, was the son and successor of Iuba II. By his mother Cleopatra he was descended from the kings of Egypt, whose name he bore. The period of his accession cannot be determined with certainty, but we know that he was on the throne in A.D. 18. He continued to reign without interruption till A.D. 40, when he was summoned to Rome by Caligula, and shortly after put to death, his great riches having excited the cupidity of the emperor.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">IV. Claudius Ptolemaeus</hi>. A famous Greek mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. He came from Ptolemaïs Hermeiou (ruins at modern Menschie), in Upper Egypt, and lived and worked in the second century A.D. The most important of his writings which have been preserved are: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">Γεωγραφικὴ Ὑφήγησις</foreign> (“instructions for the drawing of maps”), a geographical work in eight books, the first of which contains the principles of mathematical geography, the drawing of maps, and the calculation of the longitudes and latitudes of places in the then known world; books ii.-vii. contain tables of names of places in the maps described, arranged according to degrees and their subdivisions; and book viii. contains an astronomical table of climates. This work is one of the chief sources of our knowledge of ancient geography. It is edited by Nobbe <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1845)</bibl>; and Müller <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1883)</bibl>. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">Μεγάλη Σύνταξις τῆς Ἀστρονομίας</foreign>, usually known by its Arabic name of <title>Almagest.</title> Since the <title>Tetrabiblus</title>, the work on astrology, was also entitled <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign>, the Arabs, to distinguish the two, probably called the greater work <foreign lang="greek">μεγάλη</foreign>, and afterwards <foreign lang="greek">μεγίστη</foreign>: the title <title>Almagest (Tabrir al Magesthi)</title> is a compound of this last adjective and the Arabic article. The <title>Almagest</title> is divided into thirteen books. It treats of the relations of the earth and heaven; the effect of position upon the earth; the theory of the sun and moon, without which that of the stars cannot be undertaken; the sphere of the fixed stars, and those of the five stars called <hi rend="italic">planets.</hi> The seventh and eighth books are the most interesting to the modern astronomer, as they contain 
<pb n="1339" /><cb />
 a catalogue of the stars. This catalogue gives the longitudes and latitudes of 1022 stars, described by their positions in the constellations. It seems that this catalogue is in the main really that of Hipparchus, altered to Ptolemy's own time by assuming the value of the precession of the equinoxes given by Hipparchus as the least which could be, some changes having also been made by Ptolemy's own observations. Indeed, the whole work of Ptolemy appears to have been based upon the observations of Hipparchus, whom he constantly cites as his authority. Ptolemy's system of the heavens, which made the earth the fixed centre, was not superseded till the time of Copernicus <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1473-1543)</bibl>.

(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">Τετράβιβλος Σύνταξις</foreign>, generally called <title>Tetrabiblos</title>, or <title>Quadripartitum de Apotelesmatibus et Iudiciis Astrorum.</title> With this goes another small work, called <foreign lang="greek">Καρπός</foreign>, or <title>Fructus Librorum Suorum</title>, often called <title>Centiloquium</title>, from its containing a hundred aphorisms. Both of these works are astrological, and it has been doubted by some whether they be genuine. But the doubt merely arises from the feeling that the contents are unworthy of Ptolemy. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">Κανὼν Βασιλέων</foreign>, a catalogue of Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman sovereigns, with the length of their reigns, several times referred to by Syncellus.

<head orig="Publicāni">Publicani</head>

 <p> A name given by the Romans to those who did business with the State, by becoming contractors for public buildings and for supplies, and to farmers of public lands (see <ref type="cross" target="crossager">Ager Publicus</ref>), especially those who farmed the public taxes (<seg lang="la">vectigalia</seg>) for a certain time on payment of a fixed sum. In Rome, as indeed throughout the ancient world (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstelones">Telones</ref>), the collection of taxes was not made by paid officials, but by farmers of taxes, who belonged to the equestrian order, as the senators were excluded from such business. The farmers of taxes, by the immense profits which they made, became a politically powerful class of capitalists. As the various taxes in the different provinces were let out as a whole by the censors, jointstock companies were formed, <seg lang="la">societates publicanorum</seg>, whose members received a proportionate return for their invested capital. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossprovincia">Provincia</ref>.) One member, the <seg lang="la">manceps</seg>, made a tender at the public auction, concluded the contract with the censors, and gave the necessary security. The duration of the contract was a <seg lang="la">lustrum</seg>—i. e. the period between one censorship and another; in imperial times always five years. It began on the 15th of March.</p>
 <p>The general superintendence was given to a <seg lang="la">magister societatis</seg> in Rome, who vacated office every year; the management of details was in the hands of numerous officials. According to the amount of the taxes farmed, the publicani received special names. The highest class, <seg lang="la">decumani</seg>, were the farmers of the <seg lang="la">decuma</seg>, the tenth part of the produce of the agricultural lands which had been taken from the old possessors. The <seg lang="la">pecuarii</seg> or <seg lang="la">scripturarii</seg> were the farmers of the <seg lang="la">scriptura</seg>, the tax levied for the use of the State pastures. The <seg lang="la">conductorcs portoriorum</seg> were the farmers of the <seg lang="la">portoria</seg>, the import and export dues, etc. In order to make the greatest possible gain, the publicani were guilty of the most grievous oppression of the provincials, whose only hope of relief lay in the governor, who was rarely able to help them for fear of these influential societies. Under the Empire the position of the provincials was improved; for the emperor, as the governorin-chief of all the provinces, heard the final appeal in the case of any grievances. In imperial times the <seg lang="la">decumani</seg> ceased to exist, and the letting out of taxes was intrusted to the official boards especially concerned with them.

The first of them seems to stand in connection with one of the <title>leges Valeriae Horatiae</title> (B.C. 449) which enacted <seg lang="la">ut quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret</seg> (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 55</bibl>) —i. e. it restored the Comitia Tributa after the second secession of the plebs, and perhaps also provided that plebiscita which had no constitutional import, or which related purely to matters of private law, should have the force of statute, even without subsequent confirmation or enactment by the centuries. In B.C. 339, the patricians having now brought themselves to take regular part in the business of the Comitia Tributa, confirmation by the centuries must have seemed a superfluity in any case; and accordingly the first Lex Publilia seems to have dispensed with it for all plebiscita whatsoever. They still, however, required to be sanctioned by the Senate before they acquired complete validity; but the necessity of this seems to have been abolished by the Lex Hortensia (B.C. 287), which enacted <title>ut eo iure, quod plebs statuisset, omnes Quirites tenerentur</title> (<bibl n="Gaius  1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, i. 3</bibl>; Dig. 1, 2, 2, 8; Laelius Felix in <bibl n="Gel.  15. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xv. 27</bibl>; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 16.  37" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xvi. 37</bibl>). There is, however, great difference of opinion as to the real import of, and the relation between, these three leges, which, if literally taken, seem all to have enacted the same thing.

<head orig="Publilius Syrus">Publilius Syrus</head>

 <p> A Roman writer of mimes (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmimus">Mimus</ref>), a younger contemporary and rival of Laberius. He flourished about B.C. 43. Probably born at Antioch, in Syria, he came to Rome in early youth as a slave. On account of his wit he was liberated by his master, and received a careful education. As a writer of mimes and as an improviser, he was exceedingly popular, and, after the death of Laberius, held sole sway on the stage. His mimes contained, in addition to the farcical humour of this sort of writing, a great number of short, witty sayings. These were so much admired that they were excerpted at an early date, and used in schoosl, while the pieces themselves were soon forgotten.</p>
 <p>In the Middle Ages these sayings were popular under the name of Seneca. We have an alphabetical collection of nearly seven hundred of these single-line apophthegms, bearing the title <title>Publilii Syri Mimi Sententiae</title>, though not all of them are certainly the work of their alleged author. Among them are many of much pungency and pith—e. g. <title>Necesse est multos timeat, quem multi timent; Beneficium accipere, libertatem est vendere;</title> (the motto of the <title>Edinburgh Review) Iudex damnatur cum nocens absolvitur;</title> and many others that find their parallels in the saws and maxims of modern times. They are collected by Ribbeck in his edition of the comic fragments <bibl default="NO">(1873)</bibl>, and are separately edited by O. Friedrich <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1880)</bibl>; and with English notes by Gray <bibl default="NO">(1895)</bibl>.

 <p>A tribune of the plebs, B.C. 472, and again 471, who effected an important change in the Roman constitution. In virtue of the laws which he proposed, the tribunes of the plebs and the aediles were elected by the Comitia Tributa, instead of by the Comitia Centuriata, as <cb /> had previously been the case, and the tribes obtained the power of deliberating and determining in all matters affecting the whole nation, and not such only as concerned the plebs. Some say that the number of the tribunes was now for the first time raised to five, having been only two previously.

 <p> The Roman goddess of modesty and chastity. She was at first worshipped in a chapel in Rome exclusively by the patrician matrons. When, in B.C. 296, the patrician Virginia was excluded from this worship by her marriage with the plebeian consul Volumnius, she erected in her own house a chapel to the goddess, so that the plebeian matrons might worship there. Afterwards this cult died out with the decay of morals. In imperial times altars were erected to Pudicitia in honour of the empresses. The goddess was represented as a draped matron, concealing her right hand in her garment. Pudicitia is the same as the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Αἰδώς</foreign>, who had an altar at Athens.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πύξ, πυγμή, πυγμαχία, πυγμοσύνη</foreign>). Boxing. The fist being the simplest and most natural weapon, it may be taken for granted that boxing was one of the earliest athletic games among the Greeks. Hence even gods and several of the earlier heroes are described either as victors in the <foreign lang="greek">πυγμή</foreign> or as distinguished boxers, such as Apollo, Heracles, Tydeus, Polydeuces, and others (Theocrit. xxiv. 113; <bibl n="Apollod.  3. 6. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii. 6. 4</bibl>; Pausan. v. 8, 2). The Scholiast on Pindar ( <bibl n="Pind. N. 5. 89" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>v. 89</bibl>) says that Theseus was believed to have invented the art of boxing. The Homeric heroes are well acquainted with it ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 691" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 691</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Homer Od. 8. 103" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>viii. 103</bibl> foll.). Boxing for men was introduced at the Olympic Games in Ol. 23, and for boys in Ol. 37 (Pausan. v. 8. 3). Contests in boxing for boys are also mentioned in the Nemea and Isthmia (Pausan. vi. 4. 6).</p>
 <p>In the earliest times boxers (<hi rend="italic">pugiles</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">πύκται</foreign>) fought naked, with the exception of a <foreign lang="greek">ζῶμα</foreign> round their loins ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 683" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 683</bibl>;  <bibl n="Verg. A. 5. 421" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>v. 421</bibl>); but this was not used when boxing was introduced at Olympia, as the contests in wrestling and racing had been carried on here by persons entirely naked ever since Ol. 15. Respecting the leathern thongs with which pugilists surrounded their fists, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscaestus">Caestus</ref>, where its various forms are illustrated by woodcuts.</p>
 <p>The boxing of the ancients appears to have resembled the practice of modern times. It was a point of skill, we are told, not to attack the antagonist, but to remain on the defensive, and thus to wear out the opponent, until he was obliged to acknowledge himself to be conquered (Eustath.  <title>ad Il.</title>p. 1322<bibl n="Eustathius ad Il. 29" default="NO"> ad Il., 29</bibl>). It was considered a merit in a boxer to conquer without receiving any wounds, so that the two great points in this game were to inflict blows, and at the same time not to expose one's self to any danger. As regards the position of the hands, no doubt it varied according to circumstances, then as now. In art-representations we see sometimes the right arm guarding and the left striking, sometimes the contrary: the blows were directed against the upper parts of the body, and 
<pb n="1341" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01341">
<head orig="Pugilists, from a Tomb at Chiusi. (Dennis.)">Pugilists, from a Tomb at Chiusi. (Dennis.)</head>
</figure>
 the wounds inflicted on the head were often severe ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 18. 96" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>xviii. 96</bibl>; <bibl n="A. R. 2.785" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollon. Rhod. ii. 785</bibl>; Theocrit. ii. 126;  <bibl n="Verg. A. 5. 469" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>v. 469</bibl>; Aelian, <title>V. H.</title> x. 19). The ears especially were exposed to great danger, and with regular pugilists they were generally much mutilated and broken (Plato,  <title>Gorg.</title>p. 516; <title>Protag.</title> p. 342; Martial, vii. 33, 5). Hence in works of art the ears of the pancratiasts always appear beaten flat, and, although swollen in some parts, are yet smaller than ears usually are. In order to protect the ears from severe blows, little covers, called <foreign lang="greek">ἀμφωτίδες</foreign>, were invented ( <bibl n="Poll.  2. 82" default="NO">Poll.ii. 82</bibl>). But these ear-covers were undoubtedly never used in the great public games, but only in the gymnasia and palaestrae, or at most in the public contests of boxing for boys; for they are never seen in any ancient work of art.</p>
 <p>Two points of distinction between ancient and modern pugilists may be noticed: (1) that, as we gather from vase-pictures, the fist was not constantly doubled, as with us, but the fingers were often merely curved over, sometimes almost extended; in some representations, however, the fists are fairly clenched: probably the differences are due to the caestus;</p>
 <p>(2) the inarticulate sounds emitted by the boxers, instead of the modern silence: this, according to Cicero, was to add force to the blow ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 2. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tusc.</title>ii. 23</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 54" default="NO" valid="yes"> Tusc., 54</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The game of boxing, like all the other gymnastic and athletic games, was regulated by certain rules. Thus pugilists were not allowed to take hold of one another, or to use their feet for the purpose of making one another fall, as was the case in the pancratium. Cases of death, either during the fight itself or soon after, appear to have occurred rather frequently; but if a fighter wilfully killed his antagonist, he was severely punished (Pausan. vi. 9. 3; viii. 40. 3). If both the combatants were tired without wishing to give up the fight, they might pause a while to recover their strength; and in some cases they are described as resting on their knees (<bibl n="A. R. 2.86" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollon. Rhod. ii. 86</bibl>). The contest did not end until one of the combatants was compelled by fatigue, wounds, or despair to declare himself conquered, which was <cb /> generally done by lifting up one hand ( <title>Lycurg.</title> 19).</p>
 <p>The Ionians, especially those of Samos, were at all times more distinguished pugilists than the Dorians, and at Sparta boxing is said to have been forbidden by the laws of Lycurgus (Pausan. vi. 2. 4; <title>Lycurg.</title> 19). But the ancients generally considered boxing as a useful training for military purposes, and a part of education no less important than any other gymnastic exercise. Even from a medical point of view, boxing was recommended (Aretaeus, <title>De Morb. Diut. Cur.</title> i. 2).</p>
 <p>In Italy boxing appears likewise to have been practised from early times (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 35</bibl>). It continued as a popular game during the whole period of the Republic as well as of the Empire ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>; <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 15, 38; <title>Calig.</title> 18). Besides the <seg lang="la">legitimi pugiles</seg>, there was a peculiarly Italian institution of <seg lang="la">catervarii pugiles</seg>, who fought, not in pairs, but in a general mêlée ( Suet. l. c.). See Krause, <title>Die Gymnastik und Agon. d. Hellenen</title>, pp. 497-534; Blümner in Baumeister, <title>Denkmäler</title>, p. 523; Grasberger, <title>Erziehung</title>, p. 205.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The First Punic War</hi> (B.C. 264-241) began when the Romans allied themselves with the <ref type="cross" target="crossmamertini">Mamertini</ref> (q.v.) of Messana, a people of Italian stock, who had appealed to Rome against the Syracusans under Hiero; and a little later against a Carthaginian force that had gained possession of the citadel of Messana. The Romans prevailed against Hiero, who made peace with them so that they could turn their whole attention to the Carthaginian armies. The principal events of this war are the siege and capture of Agrigentum by the Romans (B.C. 262), the defeat of the Roman naval force at Lipara (B.C. 260), the great naval victory of C. Duilius over the Carthaginians near Mylae (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna-rostrata">Columna Rostrata</ref>; Duilius); the still greater success of the Romans off Ecnomus (B.C. 256); the Roman invasion of Africa by Regulus, and his defeat and capture (B.C. 255); the Roman victory of L. Metellus at Panormus in Sicily (B.C. 250); the Roman naval defeat at Drepanum (B.C. 249); the decisive Roman victory off the Aegetes Islands (B.C. 242) when Catulus defeated Hanno ; and the final treaty made by Hamilcar (B.C. 241) whereby the Romans secured Sicily and an indemnity of 3200 talents.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Second Punic War</hi> (B.C. 218-201) began when Hannibal attacked the Spanish city of Saguntum, then in alliance with Rome (B.C. 219). The chief events were the invasion of Italy by Hannibal, the counter-invasion of Spain by Cn. Scipio, the Roman defeats on the Trebia and the Ticinus, near Lake Trasimenus (B.C. 217) and at Cannae (B.C. 216), the revolt of the Samnites, Apulians, Lucanians, and Bruttians to Hannibal, the war in Sicily ending in the capture of Syracuse by the Romans (B.C. 212), the war in Spain (Hasdrubal against the Scipios), the recovery of Tarentum by Fabius Maximus (B.C. 209), the defeat of Hasdrubal on the Metaurus by the Roman consul Nero, the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Spain by P. Scipio (B.C. 210-207) and his invasion of Africa, the recall of Hannibal to Carthage (B.C. 203), his final defeat by Scipio at Zama (B.C. 202), and the submission of Carthage (B.C. 201).

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Third Punic War</hi> (B.C. 149-146) began with the demand of the Romans for the destruction of the city of Carthage, a measure long advocated by Cato the Elder. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscato">Cato</ref>.) Although the Carthaginians had already surrendered all <cb /> their arms to Rome, they resolved to perish rather than submit to the annihilation of their ancient and beautiful city. They slew all the resident Italians, manufactured new arms and military equipments, collected great stores of provisions, and even the women are said to have cut off their hair for use as strings for the catapults. The first attacks of the Roman soldiery were repulsed with great slaughter, and only the genius of the younger Scipio, who was present as a military tribune, saved the attacking army from total destruction. In B.C. 147, Scipio, though under the legal age, was unanimously elected consul, and at once took command of the forces operating against Carthage. He landed in Africa in the same year, restored both discipline and confidence to the demoralized troops, and, though his fleet of fifty ships was destroyed in a three days' naval engagement, he succeeded in carrying the city by storm after a desperate and bloody resistance which lasted nearly a week. Carthage was razed to the ground, and its territory divided between Utica and the new Roman province of Africa.

 <p> The pun or play on words (<seg lang="la">lusus verborum</seg>) is common in both Greek and Latin as it is in the Oriental literatures. It was not merely an amusement or a trick of speech as it is to-day, but was based upon the generally prevalent notion that there is an intimate connection between things and their names, and that a likeness of name denotes a certain likeness of quality in the things named. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilologia">Philologia</ref>.) Hence a species of divination from names (Onomantia) existed, and omens were regularly sought in names. It is for this reason that we find the greatest writers systematically punning even in their most serious passages, as in the famous line of Aeschylus when he plays on the name of Helen (<title>Agamem.</title> 689): <lb /><foreign lang="greek">Ἑλένη ἑλένας ἕλανδρας ἑλέπτολις</foreign>.</p>
 <p>(See also lines 1040, 1049 of the same play; and <bibl n="Luc. Prom. 718" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Prom.</title>718</bibl><bibl n="Luc.

Prom. 875" default="NO" valid="yes"> Prom., 875</bibl>; Theocr. xxvi. 26, etc.) So the Romans enrolled in their military levies the names of good omen, such as Felix, Faustus, Victor, etc., at the head of the lists, and put such auspicious ones as Salvius Valerius first on the roll of the census. On one occasion the Roman troops mutinied because they were to be led into the field by one Atrius Umber (<bibl n="Liv.  28. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxviii. 28</bibl>). So Ausonius (<title>Epist.</title> xx.) says: <lb />Nam divinare est nomen componere, quod sit <lb />Fortunae, morum, vel necis iudicium.</p>
 <p>Changes of name were often made on the principle of punning, as when the enemies of the Athenians (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθηναῖοι</foreign>) called them <foreign lang="greek">Κεχηναῖοι</foreign> ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 1262" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eq.</title>1262</bibl>), when the Romans gave the drink-loving Tiberius Claudius Nero the expressive nickname of Biberius Caldius Mero, suggesting <seg lang="la">bibo, calda</seg>, and <seg lang="la">merum</seg> (see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossnomen">Nomen</ref> at the end), and when Jerome called his adversary Vigilantius, “Dormitantius.” Cicero was especially fond of puns, and a collection of these was made and published, which is mentioned by Quintilian (vi. 3, 5; cf. id. vi. 3, 3; Macrobius, <bibl n="Enn.

<div2 id="crosspurpura" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Purpŭra">Purpura</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">πορφύρα</foreign>). The finest and most costly dye of the ancients, a discovery of the Phoenicians, though known to the Greeks in the Homeric Age. This may be inferred from the frequent epithet <foreign lang="greek">πορφύρεος</foreign> applied to robes, rugs, etc. It was also known to the Romans in the time of their kings. It was obtained from two kinds of shells in the Mediterranean Sea: (1) from the trumpet-shell (Gr. <foreign lang="greek">κῆρυξ</foreign>; Lat. <seg lang="la">bucinum, murex</seg>);</p>
 <p>(2) from the true purple-shell (Gr. <foreign lang="greek">πορφύρα</foreign>; Lat. <seg lang="la">purpura, pelagia=murex brandaris</seg> or <seg lang="la">tribulus</seg>). These shells respectively contained in a diminutive bladder a small quantity of (1) scarlet-coloured,</p>
 <p>(2) black-and-red-coloured juice. The juice collected from a number of these shells was placed in salt in the proportion of about one pint of salt to every seventy-five pounds avoirdupois of juice, and heated in metal vessels by the introduction of warm vapours; then the raw material, wool and silk, was dyed in it. The best and dearest purple was always the Phoenician, especially that of Tyre, although it was prepared by other inhabitants of the Mediterranean. As the colour of the <seg lang="la">bucinum</seg> was not lasting, it was not used by itself, but only in combination with the true purpura for producing certain varieties of purple dye. By mixing <seg lang="la">bucinum</seg> with black <seg lang="la">pelagium</seg>, the juice of the true purple-shell, the fashionable violet, called the “amethyst” purple, was produced; and, by a double process of dyeing, first in half-boiled <seg lang="la">pelagium</seg>, and then in <seg lang="la">bucinum</seg>, Tyrian purple was produced. This had the colour of clotted blood, and when looked at straight appeared black, but when held to the light it glowed with colour. A pound of violet wool cost in Caesar's time 100 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($20), Tyrian purple wool above 1000 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> ($200). By mixing <seg lang="la">pelagium</seg> with other matter— <cb /> water, urine, and orchilla—the bright purple dyes —heliotrope-blue, mauve-blue, and violet-yellow —were obtained. Other colours were produced by the combination of the different methods of dyeing; first dyeing the material with violet colour, purple dye, and scarlet (produced from the <seg lang="la">coccus ilicis</seg>); then by using the Tyrian method they obtained the <seg lang="la">tyrianthinum</seg>, the Tyrian shell-purple, and the variety called the <foreign lang="greek">ὕσγινον</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">ὕσγη</foreign>, a variety of <foreign lang="greek">πρῖνος</foreign>, or <seg lang="la">quercus coccifera</seg> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 9. 124" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>ix. 124</bibl>-141). The native dye was apparently not easily distinguished from the Tyrian when newly applied, except by the connoisseur ( <title>Epist.</title> i. 10, 26-30). For further details, see Blümner's <title>Technologie</title>, i. 224-240.</p>
 <p>Purple robes were used at an early date by the Greeks as a mark of dignity. Even the Athenian archons wore purple mantles officially. In Rome at one time broad, at another narrow, stripes of purple on the toga and tunic served as marks of distinction for senators, magistrates, and members of the equestrian order. The robes of the general were dyed in purple (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspaludamentum">Paludamentum</ref>); so also was the gold-embroidered mantle worn by one who celebrated a triumph. For a long time home-purple was used; Tyrian purple was not introduced till the middle of the first century B.C., and from that time it became a luxury. In spite of repeated attempts to check by imperial decrees the use of real purple among private individuals, robes trimmed with purple, or altogether dyed with it, became more and more used. Only a complete robe of <seg lang="la">blatta</seg>, the finest kind of purple, of which there were five varieties, was reserved as an imperial privilege, and any private person who wore it was punished as being guilty of high-treason (<title>Cod. Theod.</title> iv. 40, 1). From the second century A.D. the emperors took part in this lucrative industry, and from the end of the fourth century A.D. the manufacture of the <seg lang="la">blatta</seg> became an imperial monopoly.

 <p> The Latin term for a circular stone enclosure, consisting of a dwarf wall, surrounding either (1) the mouth of a well (<seg lang="la">puteus</seg>) or</p>
 <p>(2) a spot struck by lightning. Italian superstition demanded that every flash of lightning which struck and was buried in the earth should have, as it were, a grave and a propitiatory offering, as in the case of a human being. According to the place where the flash fell, this offering was made, either by the State or by private individuals, in the earlier times according to the directions of the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi>, at a later date after consultation with the Etruscan <seg lang="la">haruspices.</seg> The earth which was touched by the divine fire was carefully collected (Lucan, i. 606), and enclosed in a coffin constructed out of four side-pieces and without any bottom (this was the burying of the lightning). Then round the coffin a shaft, consisting of four walls and open at the top, was built up to the surface of the ground. A place which had thus been consecrated by the offering which the <seg lang="la">haruspices</seg> made of a sheep fully teethed (<seg lang="la">bidens</seg>) was especially called a <seg lang="la">bidental</seg>, and was not allowed to be desecrated. According to the pontifical rite introduced by Numa, the propitiatory offering consisted of onions, hair, and sardels. If a human being had been struck

It obtained the name of Puteoli either from its numerous wells or from the stench arising from the mineral springs in its neighbourhood. The <cb /> town was indebted for its importance to its excellent harbour, which was protected by an extensive mole to which Caligula attached a floating bridge, which extended as far as Baiae, a distance of two miles. Puteoli was the chief emporium for the commerce with Alexandria and with the greater part of Spain. The town was colonized by the Romans in B.C. 194, and also anew by Augustus, Nero, and Vespasian. It was destroyed by Alaric in A.D. 410, by Genseric in 455, and also by Totila in 545, but was on each occasion speedily rebuilt. There are still many ruins of the ancient town at the modern Pozzuoli.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πύρρων</foreign>). The founder of the Sceptical or Pyrrhonian School of philosophy, a native of Elis in the Peloponnesus. He is said to have been poor, and to have followed at first the profession of a painter. He is then said to have been attracted to philosophy by the books of Democritus, to have attended the lectures of Bryson, a disciple of Stilpon, to have attached himself closely to Anaxarchus, and with him to have joined the expedition of Alexander the Great. During the greater part of his life he lived in retirement, and endeavoured to render himself independent of all external circumstances. His disciple Timon extolled with admiration his supreme repose of soul and his indifference to pleasure or pain. So highly was he valued by his fellow-citizens that they made him their high-priest, and erected a monument to him after his death. The Athenians conferred upon him the rights of citizenship. We know little respecting the principles of his sceptical philosophy, and the tales told about him by Diogenes Laertius are probably the invention of his enemies. He asserted that certain knowledge on any subject was unattainable, and that the great object of man ought to be to lead a virtuous life. Pyrrho wrote no works, except a poem addressed to Alexander, which was rewarded by the latter in a royal manner. Pyrrho's philosophical system was first reduced to writing by his disciple Timon the Sillographer. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstimon">Timon</ref>.) He reached the age of ninety years, but his dates are uncertain.

<head orig="Pyrrhus">Pyrrhus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πύρρος</foreign>). (1) I. A king of Epirus, son of Aeacides and Phthia, born B.C. 318. His ancestors claimed descent from Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, who was said to have settled in Epirus after the Trojan War, and to have become the founder of the race of Molossian kings. On the deposition of his father by the Epirots (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaeacides">Aeacides</ref>), Pyrrhus, who was then a child only two years <cb /> old, was saved from destruction by the faithful adherents of the king, who carried him to Glaucias, the king of the Taulantians, an Illyrian people. Glaucias took the child under his care and brought him up with his own children. He not only refused to surrender Pyrrhus to Cassander, but about ten years afterwards he marched into Epirus at the head of an army, and placed Pyrrhus on the throne, leaving him, however, under the care of guardians, as he was then only twelve years of age. In the course of four or five years, however, Cassander, who had gained his supremacy in Greece, prevailed upon the Epirots to expel their young king. Pyrrhus, who was then only seventeen years of age, joined Demetrius, who had married his sister Deïdamia, accompanied him to Asia, and was present at the battle of Ipsus (301), in which he gained great renown for his valour. Antigonus fell in the battle, and Demetrius became a fugitive; but Pyrrhus did not desert his brother-in-law in his misfortunes, and shortly afterwards went for him as a hostage into Egypt. Here he was fortunate enough to win the favour of Berenicé, the wife of Ptolemy, and received in marriage Antigoné, her daughter by her first husband. Ptolemy now supplied him with a fleet and forces, with which he returned to Epirus. Neoptolemus, who had reigned from the time that Pyrrhus had been driven from the kingdom, agreed to share the sovereignty with Pyrrhus. But such an arrangement could not last long, and Pyrrhus anticipated his own destruction by putting his rival to death. This appears to have happened in 295, in which year Pyrrhus is said to have begun to reign.</p>
 <p>He was now twenty-three years old, and he soon became one of the most popular princes of his time. His daring courage made him a favourite with his troops, and his affability and generosity secured the love of his people. He seems at an early age to have taken Alexander as his model, and to have been fired with the ambition of imitating his exploits and treading in his footsteps. His eyes were first directed to the conquest of Macedonia. By assisting Alexander, the son of Cassander, against his brother Antipater, he obtained possession of the whole of the Macedonian dominions on the western side of Greece. But the Macedonian throne 
<pb n="1348" /><cb />
 itself fell into the hands of Demetrius, greatly to the disappointment of Pyrrhus. The two former friends now became the most deadly enemies, and open war broke out between them in 291. After the war had been carried on with great vigour and various vicissitudes for four years, Pyrrhus joined the coalition formed in 287 by Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus against Demetrius. Lysimachus and Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia; Demetrius was deserted by his troops and obliged to fly in disguise, and the kingdom was divided between Lysimachus and Pyrrhus. But the latter did not long retain his portion; the Macedonians preferred the rule of their old general Lysimachus, and Pyrrhus was accordingly driven out of the country after a reign of seven months (286).</p>
 <p>For the next few years Pyrrhus reigned quietly in Epirus without embarking in any new enterprise. But a life of inactivity was insupportable to him, and accordingly he readily accepted the invitation of the Tarentines to assist them in their war against the Romans. He crossed over to Italy early in 280, in the thirty-eighth year of his age. He took with him 20,000 foot, 3000 horse, 2000 archers, 500 slingers, and either fifty or twenty elephants, having previously sent Milo, one of his generals, with a detachment of 3000 men. As soon as he arrived at Tarentum he began to make vigourous preparations for carrying on the war; and as the giddy and licentious inhabitants of Tarentum complained of the severity of his discipline, he forthwith treated them as their master rather than as their ally, shut up the theatre and all other public places, and compelled their young men to serve in his ranks. In the first campaign (280) the Roman consul M. Valerius Laevinus was defeated by Pyrrhus near Heraclea, on the bank of the river Siris. The battle was long and bravely contested, and it was not till Pyrrhus brought forward his elephants, which bore down everything before them, that the Romans took to flight. The loss of Pyrrhus, though inferior to that of the Romans, was still very considerable. A large proportion of his officers and best troops had fallen, and he said, as he viewed the field of battle, “Another such victory, and I must return to Epirus alone.” He therefore availed himself of his success to send his minister Cineas to Rome with proposals of peace, while he himself marched slowly towards the city. His proposals, however, were rejected by the Senate. He accordingly continued his march, ravaging the Roman territory as he went along. He advanced within twenty-four miles of Rome; but as he found it impossible to compel the Romans to accept the peace, he retraced his steps and withdrew into winter-quarters at Tarentum. As soon as the armies were quartered for the winter, the Romans sent an embassy to Pyrrhus to endeavour to obtain the ransom of the Roman prisoners. The ambassadors were received by Pyrrhus in the most distinguished manner, and his interviews with C. Fabricius, who was at the head of the embassy, form one of the most celebrated stories in Roman history. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfabricius">Fabricius</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the second campaign (279) Pyrrhus gained another victory near Asculum over the Romans, who were commanded by the consuls P. Decius Mus and P. Sulpicius Saverrio. The battle, however, was followed by no decisive results, and the brunt of it had again fallen, as in the previous year, almost exclusively on the Greek troops of the <cb /> king. He was therefore unwilling to hazard his surviving Greeks by another campaign with the Romans, and accordingly he lent a ready ear to the invitations of the Greeks in Sicily, who begged him to come to their assistance against the Carthaginians. The Romans were likewise anxious to get rid of so formidable an opponent, that they might complete the subjugation of Southern Italy without further interruption. When both parties had the same wishes, it was not difficult to find a fair pretext for bringing the war to a conclusion. This was afforded at the beginning of the following year (278) by one of the servants of Pyrrhus deserting to the Romans and proposing to the consuls to poison his master. The consuls Fabricius and Aemilius sent back the deserter to the king, stating that they abhorred a victory gained by treason. Thereupon Pyrrhus, to show his gratitude, sent Cineas to Rome with all the Roman prisoners without ransom and without conditions; and the Romans granted him a truce, though not a formal peace, as he had not consented to evacuate Italy.</p>
 <p>Pyrrhus now crossed over into Sicily, where he remained upwards of two years, from the middle of 278 to the latter end of 276. At first he met with brilliant success, defeated the Carthaginians and took Eryx; but having failed in an attempt upon Lilybaeum, he lost his popularity with the Greeks, who began to form cabals and plots against him. This led to retaliation on the part of Pyrrhus, and to acts which were deemed both cruel and tyrannical by the Greeks. His position in Sicily at length became so uncomfortable and dangerous that he soon became anxious to abandon the island. Accordingly, when his Italian allies again begged him to come to their assistance, he gladly complied with their request. Pyrrhus returned to Italy in the autumn of 276. In the following year (275) the war was brought to a close. Pyrrhus was defeated with great loss near Beneventum by the Roman consul Curius Dentatus, and was obliged to leave Italy. He brought back with him to Epirus only 8000 foot and 500 horse, and had not money to maintain even these without undertaking new wars. Accordingly, in 273, he invaded Macedonia, of which Antigonus Gonatas, the son of Demetrius, was then king. His only object at first seems to have been plunder, but his success far exceeded his expectations. Antigonus was deserted by his own troops, and Pyrrhus thus became king of Macedonia a second time. But scarcely had he obtained possession of the kingdom before his restless spirit drove him into new enterprises. On the invitation of Cleonymus he turned his arms against Sparta, but was repulsed in an attack upon this city. From Sparta he marched towards Argos in order to support Aristeas, one of the leading citizens at Argos, against his rival Aristippus, whose cause was espoused by Antigonus. In the nighttime Aristeas admitted Pyrrhus into the city, but the alarm having been given, the citadel and all the strong places were seized by the Argives of the opposite faction. On the dawn of day Pyrrhus saw that it would be necessary for him to retreat; and as he was fighting his way out of the city, an Argive woman hurled down from the housetop a ponderous tile, which struck Pyrrhus on the back of his neck. He fell from his horse stunned with the blow, and being recognized by some of the soldiers of Antigonus, was quickly despatched. 
<pb n="1349" /><cb /></p>
 <p>His head was cut off and carried to Antigonus, who turned away from the sight, and ordered the body to be interred with becoming honours. Pyrrhus perished in B.C. 272, in the forty-sixth year of his age and in the twenty-third of his reign.</p>
 <p>He was the greatest warrior and one of the best princes of his time. With his daring courage, his military skill, and his kingly bearing, he might have become the most powerful monarch of his day if he had steadily pursued the immediate object before him. But he never rested satisfied with any acquisition, and was ever grasping at some fresh object: hence Antigonus compared him to a gambler, who made many good throws with the dice, but was unable to make the proper use of the game. Pyrrhus was regarded in subsequent times as one of the greatest generals that had ever lived. Hannibal said that of all generals Pyrrhus was the first, Scipio the second, and himself the third; or, according to another version of the story, Alexander was the first, Pyrrhus the second, and himself the third. Pyrrhus wrote a work on the art of war, which was read in the time of Cicero; and his commentaries are quoted both by Dionysius and Plutarch. Pyrrhus married four wives: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Antigoné, the daughter of Berenicé; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) a daughter of Audoleon, king of the Paeonians; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Bircenna, a daughter of Bardylis, king of the Illyrians; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Lanassa, a daughter of Agathocles of Syracuse. His children were: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Ptolemy, born 295; killed in battle, 272; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Alexander, who succeeded his father as king of Epirus; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Helenus; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Nereis, who married Gelon of Syracuse; (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) Olympias, who married her own brother Alexander; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Deidamia or Laodamia. See the Life by Plutarch.
 </p>
 <p>(2) II. A king of Epirus, son of Alexander II. and Olympias, and grandson of Pyrrhus I., was a child at the time of his father's death (between B.C. 262 and 258). During his minority the kingdom was governed by his mother, Olympias. According to one account Olympias survived Pyrrhus, who died soon after he had grown up to manhood; according to another account Olympias had poisoned a maiden to whom Pyrrhus was attached, and was herself poisoned by him in revenge.</p>

<head orig="Pythagŏras">Pythagoras</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πυθαγόρας</foreign>). (1) A celebrated Greek philosopher, a native of Samos, and the son of Mnesarchus, who was either a merchant, or, according to others, an engraver of signets. The date of his birth is uncertain; but all authorities agree that he flourished in the times of Polycrates and Tarquinius Superbus (B.C. 540-510). He studied in his own country under Creophilus, Pherecydes of Syros, and others, and is said to have visited Egypt and many countries of the East for the purpose of acquiring knowledge. We have not much trustworthy evidence, either as to the kind and amount of knowledge which he acquired, or as to his definite philosophical views. It is certain, however, that he believed in the transmigration of souls; and he is said to have pretended that he had been Euphorbus, the son of Panthoüs, in the Trojan War, as well as various other characters. He is further said to have discovered the propositions that the triangle inscribed in a semicircle is right-angled; that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides. There is a celebrated story of his having discovered the arithmetical relations of the musical scale by observing accidentally the various sounds produced by hammers of <cb /> different weights striking upon an anvil, and suspending by strings weights equal to those of the different hammers. The retailers of the story of course never took the trouble to verify the experiment, or they would have discovered that different hammers do not produce different sounds from the same anvil, any more than different clappers do from the same bell. Discoveries in astronomy are also attributed to Pythagoras. There can be little doubt that he paid great attention to arithmetic, and its application to weights, measures, and the theory of music. Apart from all direct testimony, however, it may safely be affirmed that the very remarkable influence exerted by Pythagoras, and even the fact that he was made the hero of so many marvellous stories, proves him to have been a man both of singular capabilities and of great acquirements. It may also be affirmed with safety that the religious element was the predominant one in the character of Pythagoras, and that religious ascendancy in connection with a certain mystic religious system was the object which he chiefly laboured to secure. It was this religious element which made the profoundest impression upon his contemporaries. They regarded him as standing in a peculiarly close connection with the gods. The Crotoniats even identified him with the Hyperborean Apollo. And, without viewing him as an impostor, we may easily believe that he himself, to some extent, shared the same views. He pretended to divination and prophecy; and he appears as the revealer of a mode of life calculated to raise his disciples above the level of mankind, and to recommend them to the favour of the gods. No certainty can be arrived at as to the length of time spent by Pythagoras in Egypt or the East, or as to his residence and efforts in Samos or other Grecian cities, before he settled at Crotona in Italy. He probably removed to Crotona because he found it impossible to realize his schemes in his native country while under the tyranny of Polycrates. The reason why he selected Crotona as the sphere of his operations it is impossible to ascertain; but soon after his arrival in that city he attained extensive influence, and gained over great numhers to enter into his views. His adherents were chiefly of the noble and wealthy classes. Three hundred of these were formed into a select brotherhood or club, bound by a sort of vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of cultivating the religious and ascetic observances enjoined by their master, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. Everything that was done and taught among the members was kept a profound secret from all without its pale. It was an old Pythagorean maxim, that everything was not to be told to everybody. There were also gradations among the members themselves, as in the distinction of <foreign lang="greek">ἀκουσματικοί</foreign> or “hearers” as contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">μαθηματικοί</foreign> or esoteric students. In the admission of candidates Pythagoras is said to have placed great reliance on his physiognomical discernment. If admitted, they had to pass through a period of probation, in which their powers of maintaining silence were especially tested, as well as their general temper, disposition, and mental capacity. As regards the nature of the esoteric instruction to which only the most approved members of the fraternity were admitted, some have supposed that it had reference to the political views of Pythagoras. Others have maintained, 
<pb n="1350" /><cb /> with greater probability, that it related mainly to the <hi rend="italic">orgies</hi>, or secret religious doctrines and usages, which undoubtedly formed a prominent feature in the Pythagorean system, and were peculiarly connected with the worship of Apollo. There were some outward peculiarities of an ascetic kind in the mode of life to which the members of the brotherhood were subjected. Some represent him as forbidding all animal food; but all the members cannot have been subjected to this prohibition, since the athletic Milo, for instance, could not possibly have dispensed with animal food. According to some ancient authorities, he allowed the use of all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams. There is a similar discrepancy as to the prohibition of fish and beans. But temperance of all kinds seems to have been strictly enjoined. It is also stated that they had common meals, resembling the Spartan syssitia, at which they met in companies of ten. Considerable importance seems to have been attached to music and gymnastics in the daily exercises of the disciples. Their whole discipline is represented as tending to produce a lofty serenity and self-possession, regarding the exhibition of which various anecdotes were current in antiquity. Among the best ascertained features of the brotherhood are the devoted attachment of the members to each other, and their sovereign contempt for those who did not belong to their ranks. It appears that they had some secret conventional symbols, by which members of the fraternity could recognize each other, even if they had never met before. Clubs similar to that at Crotona were established at Sybaris, Metapontum, Tarentum, and other cities of Magna Graecia. The institutions of Pythagoras were certainly not intended to withdraw those who adopted them from active exertion, that they might devote themselves exclusively to religious and philosophical contemplations. He rather aimed at the production of a calm bearing and elevated tone of character, through which those trained in the discipline of the Pythagorean life should exhibit in their personal and social capacities a reflection of the order and harmony of the universe. Whether he had any distinct political designs in the foundation of his brotherhood is doubtful; but it was perfectly natural, even without any express design on his part, that a club such as the Three Hundred of Crotona should gradually come to mingle political with other objects, and, by the facilities afforded by their secret and compact organization, should speedily gain extensive political influence. That this influence should be decisively on the side of aristocracy or oligarchy resulted naturally both from the nature of the Pythagorean institutions, and from the rank and social position of the members of the brotherhood. Through them, of course, Pythagoras himself exercised a large amount of indirect influence over the affairs both of Crotona and of other Italian cities. This Pythagorean brotherhood or order resembled in many respects the one founded by Loyola. It is easy to understand how this aristocratical and exclusive club would excite the jealousy and hostility not only of the democratical party in Crotona, but also of a considerable number of the opposite faction. The hatred which they had excited speedily led to their destruction. The populace of Crotona rose against them; and an attack was made upon them <cb /> while assembled either in the house of Milo, or in some other place of meeting. The building was set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the more active escaped. Similar commotions ensued in the other cities of Magna Graecia in which Pythagorean clubs had been formed. As an active and organized brotherhood, the Pythagorean Order was everywhere suppressed; but the Pythagoreans still continued to exist as a sect, the members of which kept up among themselves their religious observances and scientific pursuits, while individuals, as in the case of Archytas, acquired now and then great political influence.</p>
 <p>Respecting the fate of Pythagoras himself, the accounts varied. Some say that he perished in the temple with his disciples, others that he fled first to Tarentum, and that, being driven thence, he escaped to Metapontum, and there starved himself to death. His tomb was shown at Metapontum in the time of Cicero. According to some accounts, Pythagoras married Theano , a lady of Crotona, and had a daughter Damo, and a son Telauges, or, according to others, two daughters, Damo and Myia ; while other notices seem to imply that he had a wife and a daughter grown up when he came to Crotona. When we come to inquire what were the philosophical or religious opinions held by Pythagoras himself, we are met at the outset by the difficulty that even the authors from whom we have to draw possessed no authentic records bearing upon the age of Pythagoras himself. If Pythagoras ever wrote anything, his writings perished with him, or not long after. The probability is that he wrote nothing. Everything current under his name in antiquity is spurious. It is all but certain that Philolaüs was the first who <hi rend="italic">published</hi> the Pythagorean doctrines, at any rate in a written form. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilolaus">Philolaüs</ref>.) Still there was so marked a peculiarity running through the Pythagorean philosophy that there can be little question as to the germs of the system, at any rate, having been derived from Pythagoras himself. Pythagoras resembled the philosophers of the Ionic school, who undertook to solve, by means of a single primordial principle, the vague problem of the origin and constitution of the universe as a whole. His predilection for mathematical studies led him to trace the origin of all things to <hi rend="italic">number</hi>, his theory being suggested, or at all events confirmed, by the observation of various numerical relations, or analogies to them, in the phenomena of the universe. Musical principles likewise played almost as important a part in the Pythagorean system as mathematical or numerical ideas. We find running through the entire system the idea that order, or harmony of relation, is the regulating principle of the whole universe. The intervals between the heavenly bodies were supposed to be determined according to the laws and relations of musical harmony. Hence arose the celebrated doctrine of the harmony of the spheres; for the heavenly bodies, in their motion, could not but occasion a certain sound or note, depending on their distances and velocities; and as these were determined by the laws of harmonical intervals, the notes altogether formed a regular musical scale or harmony. This harmony, however, we do not hear, either because we have been accustomed to it from the first, and have never had an opportunity of contrasting it with stillness, or because the sound is so powerful as to 
<pb n="1351" /><cb />
 exceed our capacities for hearing. The ethics of the Pythagoreans consisted more in ascetic practice, and maxims for the restraint of the passions, especially of anger, and the cultivation of the power of endurance, than in scientific theory. What of the latter they had was, as might be expected, intimately connected with their numbertheory. Happiness consisted in the science of the perfection of the virtues of the soul, or in the perfect science of numbers. Likeness to the Deity was to be the object of all our endeavours, man becoming better as he approaches the gods, who are the guardians and guides of men. Great importance was attached to the influence of music in controlling the force of the passions. Self-examination was strongly insisted on. The transmigration of souls was viewed apparently in the light of a process of purification. Souls under the dominion of sensuality either passed into the bodies of animals, or, if incurable, were thrust down into Tartarus to meet with expiation or condign punishment. The pure were exalted to higher modes of life, and at last attained to incorporeal existence. As regards the fruits of this system of training or belief, it is interesting to remark, that wherever we have notices of distinguished Pythagoreans, we usually hear of them as men of great uprightness, conscientiousness, and self-restraint, and as capable of devoted and enduring friendship.

He had no political principles, made no pretensions to honesty, and changed sides as often as suited his convenience or his interest. Of the part that he took in political affairs only two or three facts are recorded. He opposed the honours which the Athenians proposed to confer upon Alexander, but he afterwards espoused the interests of the Macedonian party. He accused Demosthenes of having received bribes from Harpalus. In the Lamian War (B.C. 322) he joined Antipater, and had thus the satisfaction of surviving his great enemy Demosthenes. He is said to have been the author of the well-known saying that the orations of Demosthenes smelt of the lamp.</p>
 <p>(2) Of Massilia in Gaul, a celebrated Greek navigator, who sailed to the western and northern parts of Europe, and wrote a book containing the <cb /> results of his discoveries. He probably lived in the time of Alexander the Great or shortly afterwards. He appears to have undertaken two voyages, one in which he visited Britain and Thulé, and of which he probably gave an account in his work on the Ocean; and a second, undertaken after his return from his first voyage, in which he coasted along the whole of Europe from Gadira (now Cadiz) to the Tanaïs (Don), and the description of which probably formed the subject of his <title>Periplus.</title> Pytheas made Thulé a six days' sail from Britain, and said that the day and the night were each six months long in Thulé; hence some modern writers have supposed that he must have reached Iceland, while others have maintained that he advanced as far as the Shetland Islands. But either supposition is very improbable, and neither is necessary; for reports of the great length of the day and night in the northern parts of Europe had already reached the Greeks before the time of Pytheas. There has been likewise much dispute as to what river we are to understand by the Tanaïs. The most probable conjecture is that, upon reaching the Elbe, Pytheas concluded that he had arrived at the Tanaïs, separating Europe from Asia.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Πύθια</foreign>). The Pythian Games. Next to the Olympic Games, the most important of the four Greek national festivals. From B.C. 586 they were held on the Crissaean Plain below Delphi (originally called Pytho). They took place once in four years, in the third year of each Olympiad, in the Delphic month Bucatius, corresponding to a part of our middle of Before this time (B.C. 586) there used to take place at Delphi itself, once in eight years, a great festival in honour of Apollo, the traditional founder (Athen. xv. p. 701), in which the minstrels vied with one another in singing, to the accompaniment of the cithara, a paean in praise of the god, under the direction of the Delphic priests. After the first Sacred War, when the Crissaean Plain became the property of the priesthood, the Amphictyones introduced festivals once in four years, at which gymnastic contests and foot-races took place, as well as the customary musical contest. This contest also was further developed. Besides minstrels who sang to the cithara, players on the flute, and singers to accompaniment of the flute, took part in it, the lastnamed, however, for a short time only. The gymnastic and athletic contests, which were nearly the same as those held at Olympia, yielded in significance to the musical ceremonies, and of those the Pythian <foreign lang="greek">νόμος</foreign> was the most important. It was a composition for the flute, worked out on a prescribed scheme, and celebrating the battle of Apollo with the dragon Python , and his triumph. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdelphi">Delphi</ref>.) At first the prize for the victor was of some substantial value, but at the second festival it took the form of a wreath from the sacred bay tree in the Vale of Tempé. The victor also received, as in the other contests, a palm-branch. The judges were chosen by the Amphictyones. The Pythian, like the Olympic, Games were probably not discontinued till about A.D. 394. Minor Pythian Games were celebrated in other parts of the Greek world—e. g. at Ancyra in Galatia, at Aphrodisias in Caria, at Carthage, Delos, Miletus, Perinthus, Sicyon, etc. See Krause, <title>Die Pythien, Nemeen und Isthmien</title>, pp. 1-106.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Πύθιος</foreign>). A Lydian, the son of Atys. He was a man of enormous wealth, which he derived from his gold mines in the neighbourhood of Celaenae in Phrygia. When Xerxes arrived at Celaenae, Pythius banqueted him and his whole army. His five sons accompanied Xerxes. Pythius, alarmed by an eclipse of the sun which happened, came to Xerxes, and begged that the eldest might be left behind. This request so enraged the king that he had the young man immediately killed and cut in two, and the two portions of his body placed on either side of the road, and then <cb /> ordered the army to march between them ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 21</bibl>).

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
