<div2 id="crossecbatana" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ecbatăna">Ecbatana</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ἐκβάτανα</foreign>; <title>Acmetha</title>). (1) The capital of Media, situated, according to Diodorus (ii. 13), about twelve stadia from Mount Orontes. The genuine orthography of the word appears to be Agbatana (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀγβάτανα</foreign>), a form employed by Ctesias. Ecbatana, being in a high <cb /> and mountainous country, was a favourite residence of the Persian kings during summer, when the heat of Susa was almost insupportable. The Parthian kings also, at a later period, retired to it in the summer to avoid the excessive heat of Ctesiphon. According to Herodotus (i. 98), Ecbatana was built near the close of the eighth century B.C. by Deïoces, the founder of the Median monarchy. The Book of Judith (i. 2) assigns the building of this city, or, rather, the erection of its citadel, to Arphaxad, in the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyria. Some writers make Arphaxad the same with Deïoces, while others identify him with Phraortes, the son of the latter, who might have repaired the city or else made some additions to it.</p>
 <p>Herodotus furnishes us with no hint whence we may infer the relative position of Ecbatana on the map of Media. His description of the fortress or citadel, however, is particular. “The Medes,” he remarks, “in obedience to their king's command, built those spacious and massive fortifications now called Ecbatana, circle within circle, according to the following plan: each inner circle overtops its outer neighbour by the height of the battlements alone. This was effected partly by the nature of the ground, a conical hill, and partly by the building itself. The number of the circles was seven; within the innermost were built the palace and the treasury. The circumference of the outermost wall and of the city of Athens may be regarded as nearly equal. The battlements of the first circle are white; of the second, black; of the third, scarlet; of the fourth, azure; of the fifth, orange. All these are brilliantly coloured with different paints. But the battlements of the sixth circle are silvered over, while those of the seventh are gilt. Deïoces constructed these walls around his palace for his own personal safety; but he ordered the people to erect their houses in a circle around the outer wall” (i. 98 foll.). The Orientals, however, according to Diodorus Siculus, claimed a far more ancient origin for Ecbatana. Ctesias not only describes it as the capital of the first Median monarchy, founded by Arbaces, but as existing prior to the era of the famed and fabulous Semiramis, who is said to have visited Ecbatana in the course of her royal journeys and to have built there a magnificent palace. She also, with immense labour and expense, introduced abundance of excellent water into the city by perforating the adjacent Mount Orontes, and forming a tunnel, fifteen feet broad and forty feet high, through which she conveyed a lake-stream ( <bibl n="Diod.  2. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.ii. 13</bibl>). The palace stood below the citadel. Its tiles were of silver and its capitals, entablatures, and wainscotings of gold and silver. This metal the Seleucidae coined into money, amounting to the sum of 4000 talents, or $4,730,000.</p>
 <p>Ecbatana was taken by Cyrus in B.C. 549, and remained a splendid city under the Persian sway, the great king spending at this place the two hottest months of the year. The Macedonian conquest did not prove destructive to Ecbatana, as it had to the royal palace at Persepolis. Alexander deposited 
<pb n="565" /><cb />
 in Ecbatana the treasures taken from Persepolis and Pasargada, and one of the last acts of his life was a royal visit to the Median capital. Although not equally favoured by the Seleucidae, it still retained the traces of its former grandeur; and Polybius has left on record a description of its state under Antiochus the Great, which shows that Ecbatana was still a splendid city, though it had been despoiled of many of its more costly decorations (Polyb. x. frag. 4). When the Seleucidae were driven from Upper Asia, Ecbatana became the favourite summer residence of the Arsacidae, and at the close of the first century it still continued to be the Parthian capital ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xv. 31</bibl>). When the Persians, under the house of Sassan, A.D. 226, recovered the dominion of Upper Asia, Ecbatana continued to be a favourite and secure place of residence. The natural bulwarks of Mount Zagros were never forced by the Roman legions. Consequently, as we learn from Ammianus Marcellinus, near the close of the fourth century Ecbatana continued to be a strongly fortified city. See G. Rawlinson's <title>Herodotus</title>, vol. i. p. 226 <bibl default="NO">(1875)</bibl>; and on the site, Sir Henry Rawlinson in the <title>Journal of the Royal Geog. Society</title> for 1841.

<div2 id="crossecclesia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ecclesia">Ecclesia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησία</foreign>). The assembly of the people, which in Greek cities had the power of final decision in public affairs.</p>
 <p>(1) At <hi rend="SmallCaps">Athens</hi> every citizen in possession of full civic rights was entitled to take part in it from his twentieth year upwards. In early times one ecclesia met regularly once a year in each of the ten prytanies of the Senate (see <ref type="cross" target="crossboule">Boulé</ref>); in later times four, making forty annually. Special assemblies might also be called on occasion. The place of meeting was in early times the marketplace, in later times a special locality, called the Pnyx; but generally the theatre, after a permanent theatre had been erected. To summon the assembly was the duty of the Prytanes, who did so by publishing the notice of proceedings. There was a special authority, a board of six Lexiarchi (<foreign lang="greek">ληξίαρχοι</foreign>) with thirty assistants, whose business it was to keep unauthorized persons out of the assembly. The members on their appearance were each presented with a ticket, on exhibiting which, after the conclusion of the meeting, they received a payment of an <seg lang="la">obolus</seg> (about three cents), in later times of three obols. After a solemn prayer and sacrifice the president (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιστάτης</foreign>) communicated to the meeting the subjects of discussion. If there were a previous resolution of the Senate for discussion, he put the question whether the people would adopt it or proceed to discuss it. In the debates every citizen had the right of addressing the meeting, but no one could speak more than once. Before doing so he put a crown of myrtle on his head. The president (but no one else) had the right of interrupting a speaker. If his behaviour were unseemly, the president could cut short his harangue, expel him from the rostrum and from the meeting, and inflict upon him a fine not exceeding 500 drachmae ($83). Cases of graver misconduct had to be referred to the Senate or Assembly for punishment. Any citizen could move an amendment or counter-proposal, which he handed <cb /> in writing to the presiding <foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεία</foreign>. The president had to decide whether it should be put to vote. This could be prevented, not only by the mere declaration of the president that it was illegal, but by any one present who bound himself on oath to prosecute the proposer for illegality. The speaker might also retract his proposal. The votes were taken by show of hands. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosschirotonia">Chirotonia</ref>.) The voting was never secret, unless the question affected some one's personal interest, as in the case of ostracism. In such cases a majority of at least 6000 votes was necessary. The resolution (<foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign>) was announced by the president, and a record of it taken, which was deposited in the archives, and often publicly exhibited on tables of stone or bronze. After the conclusion of business, the president, through his herald, dismissed the people. If no final result was arrived at, or if the business was interrupted by a sign from heaven, such as a storm or a shower of rain, the meeting was adjourned. Certain classes of business were assigned to the ordinary assemblies.</p>
 <p>The functions of the ecclesia were:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) To take part in legislation. At the first regular assembly in the year the president asked the question whether the people thought any alteration necessary in the existing laws. If the answer were in the affirmative, the proposals for alteration were brought forward, and in the third regular assembly a legislative commission was appointed from among the members of the Heliaea or jury for the current year. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossheliaea">Heliaea</ref>.) The members of this commission were called <foreign lang="greek">νομοθέται</foreign>. The question between the old laws and the new proposals was then decided by a quasi-judicial process under the presidency of the <foreign lang="greek">θεσμοθέται</foreign>, the proposers of the new law appearing as prosecutors, and advocates, appointed by the people, coming forward to defend the old one. If the verdict were in favour of the new law, the latter had the same authority as a resolution of the ecclesia. The whole proceeding was called “voting (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιχειροτονία</foreign>) upon the laws.” In the decadence of the democracy the custom grew up of bringing legislative proposals before the people, and having them decided at any time that pleased the proposer.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Election of officials. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossprobole">Probolé</ref>.) This only affected, of course, the officials who were elected by show of hands, as the strategi and ministers of finance, not those chosen by lot. In the first ecclesia of every prytany the archon asked the question whether the existing ministers were to be allowed to remain in office or not, and those who failed to commend themselves were deposed.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The banishment of citizens by ostracism. See <ref type="cross" target="crossostracismus">Ostracismus</ref>.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Judicial functions in certain exceptional cases only. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosseisangelia">Eisangelia</ref>.) Sometimes, if offences came to its knowledge, the people would appoint a special commission of inquiry, or put the inquiry into the hands of the Areopagus or the Senate. Offences committed against officials or against private individuals were also at times brought before the assembly, to obtain from it a declaration that it did, or did not, think the case one which called for a judicial process. Such a declaration, though not binding on the judge, always carried with it a certain influence.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) In legal co-operation with the Senate the ecclesia had the final decision in all matters affecting 
<pb n="566" /><cb /> the supreme interests of the State, as war, peace, alliances, treaties, the regulation of the army and navy, finance, loans, tributes, duties, prohibition of exports or imports, the introduction of new religious rites and festivals, the awarding of honours and rewards, and the conferring of the citizenship.</p>
 <p>(2) At <ref type="cross" target="crosssparta">Sparta</ref> all the Spartiatae, or citizens in possession of full civic rights, were entitled to take part in the deliberations of the Assembly from their thirtieth year onwards. The Assembly was convoked once a month at the full moon by the kings, and later by the ephors as well. After B.C. 600 it met in a special building in the market-place at Sparta, the Scias, the members standing, not sitting, as in the Athenian ecclesia. Its business was to accept or reject proposals made by the <foreign lang="greek">γερουσία</foreign> or Senate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgerusia">Gerusia</ref>.) It made its will known by acclamation, or, in doubtful cases, by separation of the parties into different places. The right of bringing forward proposals and speaking in the debates belonged only to the kings, the members of the Gerusia, and the ephors; in all other cases special consent was required. The functions of the Assembly were the election of the officials and senators to decide (in doubtful cases) on the regal succession, on war and peace, treaties, legislation, and other matters affecting the State.

Heré declared that in future she should have but little use of her tongue, and immediately she lost all power of doing any more

<div2 id="crosseclectici" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eclectĭci">Eclectici</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκλεκτικοί</foreign>). A name given to those ancient students of philosophy who, from the existing philosophical beliefs, tried to select (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκλέγειν</foreign>) the doctrines that seemed to them most reasonable, and out of these constructed a new system. (Cf. Diog. Laert. prooem. 21.) The name was first generally used in the first century B.C. Stoicism and Epicureanism had made the search for pure truth subordinate to the attainment of practical virtue and happiness; Skepticism had denied that pure truth was possible to discover; Eclecticism sought to reach by selection the highest possible degree of probability, in the despair of attaining to what is absolutely true. In Greek philosophy, the best known Eclectics were the Stoics Panaetius (B.C. 150) and Posidonius (B.C. 75); the New Academic, Carneades (B.C. 155), and Philo of Larissa (B.C. 75). Among the Romans, Cicero, whose cast of mind made him always doubtful and uncertain of his own attitude, was thoroughly eclectic, uniting the Peripatetic, Stoic, and New Academic doctrines, and seeking the probable (<seg lang="la">illud probabile</seg>). The same general line was followed by Varro, and in the next century the Stoic Seneca propounded a philosophical system largely based upon eclecticism.</p>
 <p>In the latest Greek philosophy appears an eclectic system consisting of a compromise between the Neo-Pythagoreans and the various Platonic sects. Still another school is that of Iudaeus Philo (q. v.), who at Alexandria, in the first century A.D., interpreted the Old Testament allegorically, and endeavoured to harmonize it with selected doctrines of Greek philosophy. Neo-Platonism (q. v.), the last product of Greek speculation, was also a fusion of Greek philosophy with Oriental religion. Its chief <cb /> representatives were Plotinus (A.D. 230), Porphyrius (A.D. 275), Iamblichus (A.D. 300), and Proclus (A.D. 450). The desire of this school was to attain right relations between God and man; it was therefore religious.</p>

(See <ref type="cross" target="crossakoen-martyrein">Akoen Martyrein</ref>.)

<div2 id="crossedictum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Edictum">Edictum</head>

 <p> The Roman term for any written announcement made by a magistrate to the people. An <seg lang="la">edictum</seg> was sometimes temporary only— as, e. g., the announcements of the public assemblies or games; sometimes it contained permanent enactments—as, for instance, the <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> of the censors against luxury. The name was especially applied to the proclamations issued by judicial functionaries on assuming office, and stating the principles or rules which they intended to follow in the exercise of their authority. The <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> of the aediles relative to the markets belong to this class. One kind of <seg lang="la">edictum</seg> was specially important in its bearing upon Roman law, the <seg lang="la">edictum</seg> of the praetor. In his <seg lang="la">edictum</seg> the praetor laid down the rules which he would observe in arranging the proceedings of the regular courts and of his voluntary jurisdiction, and in deciding cases which did not appear to be covered by the written enactments of the Twelve Tables or later legislation. These <seg lang="la">edicta</seg>, written on wood, stone, or bronze, were in early times published only as occasion required, but in later times the praetors regularly promulgated them on entering upon their office. They prevented the fossilization of the law, and allowed the enactments of the Twelve Tables to adapt themselves in natural development to the changing circumstances of civic life and intercourse. It is true that the <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> had no force beyond the praetor's year of office, but, as every new praetor observed what was found in the <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> of his predecessors, a permanent nucleus of constantly repeated rules, called <seg lang="la">edictum perpetuum</seg> (“continuous edict”), was formed in course of time. This became, for the later period, a recognized source of customary law, side by side with the <seg lang="la">leges</seg> proper. At length, under Hadrian, the mass of <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> was reduced to system by Salvius Iulianus, and received the force of law at the imperial command. This body of law included the accepted <seg lang="la">edicta</seg> of the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg> and the other praetors administering law in the provinces, of the proconsuls, propraetors, and aediles. It was called <seg lang="la">edictum perpetuum, ius praetorium</seg>, or <seg lang="la">ius honorarium</seg>—the latter because its authors had held public offices (<seg lang="la">honores</seg>). On this collection the <title>Corpus Iuris</title> of Justinian is in great part founded. The emperor and imperial officials, as <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi</seg> and <seg lang="la">praefectus praetorio</seg>, had also the right of issuing <seg lang="la">edicta.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosscorpus-iuris-civilis">Corpus Iuris</ref>.

<head orig="Edictum Theodorīci">Edictum Theodorici</head>

 <p> The first collection of law that was made after the downfall of the Roman power in Italy. It was promulgated by Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, probably on his visit to Rome in A.D. 500, though some authorities fix the date after 506. It consists of 154 chapters (besides a prologue and epilogue), parts of which may be traced to the Code and Novellae of Theodosius II., to the Codices Gregorianus and Hermogenianus, and to the <title>Sententiae</title> of Paulus; and, though it was doubtless drawn up by Roman writers, the original sources are more disfigured and altered than in any other compilation. Though the Ostrogothic kingdom was in point of fact quite independent 
<pb n="569" /><cb /> of the Eastern Roman Empire, in constitutional theory it was considered part of it, the king representing the Caesar, and his army being reckoned a portion of the emperor's forces; consequently the Roman law was still held binding in Italy, for the barbarian invaders no less than for the old inhabitants. Hence the Edict of Theodoric, so far as it went, was intended as law for both nationalities; but where it had made no change in the Gothic rules, the latter were still applied to the barbarians, while the Roman law was to prevail for the Romans in those cases to which the Edict was not applicable. After Narses had again united Italy to the empire of Justinian, the latter's legislation was established in Italy (A.D. 554), and the Edict of Theodoric had no longer any authority.</p>
 <p>This edict was first printed in the edition of Cassiodorus by Nivellius <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1579)</bibl>, and there is an edition by G. F. Rhon <bibl default="NO">(Halle, 1816)</bibl>.

 <p> A name given to the first printed edition of any classical author.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta followed a peculiar line in the matter of education. Throughout Greece generally the State left it to private effort, but in Sparta and Crete it came under the direct supervision of the community. At Sparta, as soon as a child was born, a commission of the elders of its tribe had to decide whether it should be reared or exposed. If it was weakly or deformed it was exposed in a defile of Mount Taÿgetus. Till his seventh year a boy was left to the care of his parents. After this the <foreign lang="greek">παιδονόμος</foreign>, or officer presiding over the whole department of education, assigned him to a division of children of the same age called a <foreign lang="greek">βούα</foreign>. Several of such <foreign lang="greek">βοῦαι</foreign> together formed a troop or <foreign lang="greek">ἴλη</foreign> (Dor. <foreign lang="greek">ἴλα</foreign>). Each <foreign lang="greek">βούα</foreign> was superintended by a <foreign lang="greek">βουαγός</foreign>, each <foreign lang="greek">ἴλη</foreign> by an <foreign lang="greek">ἰλάρχης</foreign>. Both these officers were elected from among the most promising of the grown-up youths, and were bound to instruct the children in their exercises. The exercises were calculated to suit the various ages of the children, and consisted in running, leaping, wrestling, throwing the spear and the discus, as well as in a number of dances, particularly the war dance or <foreign lang="greek">πυρρίχη</foreign> (q. v.). The dancing was under the constant superintendence of the <foreign lang="greek">παιδονόμος</foreign> and five <foreign lang="greek">βιδιαῖοι</foreign> under him. The discipline was generally directed to strengthening or hardening the body. The boys went barefoot and bareheaded, with hair cut short, and in light clothing. From their twelfth year they wore nothing but an upper garment, which had to last the whole year. They slept in a common room without a roof, on a litter of hay or straw, and from their fifteenth year on rushes or reeds. Their food was extremely simple, and not sufficient to satisfy hunger. A boy who did not want to be hungry had to steal; if he did <cb /> this cleverly he was praised, and punished if detected. Every year the boys had to undergo a flogging at the altar of Artemis Orthia, as a test of their power to endure bodily pain. They were whipped till the blood flowed, and deemed it a disgrace to show any sign of suffering. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbomonikes">Bomonikes</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdiamastigosis">Diamastigosis</ref>.) Reading and writing were left to private instructors; but music, and choral singing in particular, formed a part of the regular discipline. The understanding was assumed to be formed by daily life in public and the conversation of the men, to which the boys were admitted. Every Spartan boy looked up to his seniors as his instructors and superiors, the consequence being that in Sparta the young behaved to their elders with more modesty and respect than in any other Greek city. Besides this, every man chose a boy or youth as his favourite. He was bound to set the boy an example of all manly excellence, and was regarded as responsible and punishable for his delinquencies. This public education and the performance of the regular exercises, under the superintendence of the <foreign lang="greek">βιδιαῖοι</foreign>, lasted till the thirtieth year. In the eighteenth year the boy passed into the class of youths. From the twentieth year, when military service proper began, to the thirtieth, the youth was called an <foreign lang="greek">εἴρην</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἰρήν</foreign>. He was not regarded as a man or allowed to attend the public assembly till his thirtieth year.</p>
 <p>The girls had an education in music and gymnastic exercises similar to that of the boys, and at the public games and contests each sex was witness of the performances of the other. The girls' dress was extremely simple, consisting of a sleeveless tunic reaching not quite down to the knees and open at the sides. In this, however, there was nothing which interfered with modesty and propriety of behaviour.</p>
 <p>In Crete the system of education was generally similar to that of Sparta. But the public training did not begin till the seventeenth year, when the boys of the same age joined themselves freely into divisions called <foreign lang="greek">ἀγέλαι</foreign>, each led by some noble youth, whose father was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀγελάτας</foreign> and undertook the supervision of the games and exercises. It is probable that the young men remained in this organization till their twenty-seventh year, when the law compelled them to marry.</p>
 <p>At Athens, as in Greece generally, the father decided whether the child should be reared or exposed. The latter alternative seems to have been not seldom adopted, especially when the child was a girl. If the education of a child was once fairly commenced the parents had no power to put it out of the way. At the birth of a boy the door of the house was adorned with a branch of olive; at the birth of a girl, with wool. On the fifth or seventh day after birth the child underwent a religious dedication at the festival of the Amphidromia (“running round”). It was touched with instruments of purification, and carried several times round the burning hearth. On the tenth day came the festival of naming the child, with sacrifice and entertainment, when the father acknowledged it as legitimate. To the end of the sixth year the boys and girls were brought up together under female supervision, but after this the sexes were educated apart. The girl's life was almost entirely confined to her home: she was brought up under the superintendence of women and with hardly anything which can be called profitable 
<pb n="571" /><cb />
 instruction. The boy was handed over to a slave older than himself called <foreign lang="greek">παιδαγωγός</foreign>. It was the slave's duty to watch the boy's outward behaviour, and to attend him, until his boyhood was over, whenever he went out, especially to the school and the gymnasium. The laws made some provision for the proper education of boys. They obliged every citizen to have his son instructed in music, gymnastics, and the elements of letters (<foreign lang="greek">γράμματα</foreign>) —i. e. writing, reading, and arithmetic. They further obliged the parents to teach their boys some profitable trade, in case they were unable to leave them a property sufficient to maintain them independent. If they failed in this, they forfeited all claim to support from the children in old age. But with schools and their arrangements the State did not concern itself. The schools were entirely in private hands, though they were under the eye of the police. The elementary instruction was given by the <foreign lang="greek">γραμματισταί</foreign>, or teachers of letters, the teacher writing and the scholars copying. The text-books for reading were mostly poems, especially such as were calculated to have an influence on the formation of character. The Homeric poems were the favourite reading-book, but Hesiod, Theognis, and others were also admitted. Collections of suitable passages from the poets were early made for the boys to copy, learn by heart, and repeat aloud. The higher instruction given by the <foreign lang="greek">γραμματικός</foreign> was also of this literary character.</p>
 <p>Mathematics were introduced into the school curriculum as early as the fifth century, drawing not till the middle of the fourth century B.C. Instruction in music proper began about the thirteenth year. The profound moral influence attributed to music in Greek antiquity made this art an essential part of education. It brought with it, naturally, an acquaintance with the masterpieces of Greek poetry. The instrument most practised was the lyre, from its suitableness as an accompaniment to song. The flute was held in less esteem. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmusica">Musica</ref>.</p>
 <p>The aim of education was supposed to be the harmonious development of mind and body alike. Instruction in gymnastics was consequently regarded as no less essential than in music, and began at about the same age. It was carried on in the <foreign lang="greek">παλαίστρα</foreign> under the <foreign lang="greek">παιδοτρίβαι</foreign>, who were, like the <foreign lang="greek">γραμματικοί</foreign>, private, not public, instructors. The boys began their gymnastics in the palaestra, and completed them in the gymnasia under the superintendence of the <foreign lang="greek">γυμνασταί</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἔφηβοι</foreign>, in particular, or boys between sixteen and nineteen, practised their exercises in the gymnasia, till, in their twentieth year, they were considered capable of bearing arms and employed on frontier service. At this point they became liable to enlistment for foreign service, and obtained the right of attending the meeting of the public assembly. Towards the end of the fifth century B.C. the class of <foreign lang="greek">σοφισταί</foreign>, or professors of practical education, arose. These gave the young men an opportunity of extending their education by attending lectures in rhetoric and philosophy, but the high fees charged by the sophists had the effect of restricting this instruction to the sons of the wealthy.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. Among the Romans the father was free, when the new-born child was laid before him, either to expose it, or to take it up as a sign that he meant to rear it. He had also the right of selling his children or putting them to death. It was <cb /> not till the beginning of the third century A.D. that the exposure of children was legally accounted murder, nor did the evil practice cease even then. If the child was to be reared, it was named, if a boy, on the ninth day after birth, if a girl, on the eighth. The day was called <seg lang="la">dies lustricus</seg>, or day of purification. A sacrifice in the house, accompanied with a feast, gave to the child's life a religious dedication. A box with an amulet was hung round the child's neck as a protection against magic. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamuletum">Amuletum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbulla">Bulla</ref>.) Official lists of births were not published until the second century after Christ. In earlier times, in the case of boys, the name was not formally confirmed until the assumption of the <seg lang="la">toga virilis.</seg> The child's physical and moral education was, in old times, regularly given at home under the superintendence of the parents, chiefly the mother. The training was strict, and aimed at making the children strong and healthy, religious, obedient to the laws, temperate, modest in speech and action, strictly submissive to their superiors, well-behaved, virtuous, intelligent, and self-reliant. The girls were taught by their mothers to spin and weave. The boys were instructed by their fathers in ploughing, sowing, reaping, riding, swimming, boxing, and fencing; in the knowledge necessary for household management; in reading, writing, and counting; and in the laws of the country. The Romans did not, like the Greeks, lay stress on gymnastics, but only carried physical exercises to the point necessary for military service. The contests and exercises took place in the Campus Martius, which, down to the time of the Empire, was the favourite arena of the youths. The State took as little care of mental as of physical education. If a man could not educate his children himself, he sent them to a master. From an early time there were elementary teachers (<seg lang="la">litteratores</seg>) at Rome, corresponding to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">γραμματισταί</foreign>. These were sometimes slaves, who taught in their masters' houses for their benefit. Sometimes they were freedmen, who gave instruction either in families or in schools (<seg lang="la">schola</seg> or <seg lang="la">ludus</seg>) of their own. They received their salary monthly, but only for eight months in the year—no instruction being given between June and November. Boys and girls were taught together. The elementary instruction included reading, writing, and arithmetic; arithmetic being, as among the Greeks, practised by counting on the fingers. In later times grown-up boys learned arithmetic with a special master (<seg lang="la">calculator</seg>), who was paid at a higher rate than the <seg lang="la">litterator.</seg> With the duodecimal system in use arithmetic was regarded as very difficult. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumeri">Numeri</ref>.) The reading-lessons included learning the Twelve Tables by heart.</p>
 <p>After the Second Punic War it became usual, at first in single families, and afterwards more and more generally, to employ a <seg lang="la">litterator</seg>, or <seg lang="la">grammaticus</seg>, to teach Greek. The chief element in this instruction was the explanation of Greek poets, above all of Homer, whose writings became a schoolbook among the Romans as among the Greeks. At the same time higher instruction was given in Latin as well, the text-books being the Latin <title>Odyssey</title> of Livius Andronicus, the works of Terence, and in later times of Vergil, Horace, and others. The exposition of these authors gave an opportunity of communicating a variety of information. Girls were educated on the same lines. The highest point in Roman education was attained by the 
<pb n="572" /><cb />
 schools of the rhetoricians, which came into existence before the end of the republican age. In these schools, as in those of the <seg lang="la">grammatici</seg>, Greek was at first the only language taught. Since the time when Greek literature became the highest educational standard, boys, and sometimes girls, were taught Greek from their earliest years. They were put into the hands of a Greek <seg lang="la">paedagogus</seg> or a Greek female slave, and learned the first rudiments from Greek schoolmasters. As the range of subjects widened so as to include, among other things, music and geometry, more importance came to be attached to scholastic education. This tendency was strengthened by the increased demand for Greek culture which manifested itself under the Empire throughout the length and breadth of the Western provinces. Education was carried out on stricter lines as the old system of hometraining disappeared, mainly owing to the diffusion of an effeminate refinement and the parents' habit of putting their children into the hands of Greek slaves.</p>
 <p>The ordinary educational course generally concluded with a boy's sixteenth or seventeenth year, though rhetorical instruction was sometimes continued far beyond this limit; and towards the end of the republican age young men of intellectual ambition would often go to Greece to enlarge their sphere of culture.</p>
 <p>On the 17th of March, the festival of the Liberalia, boys who had reached the age of puberty, or their fifteenth year, took off, in the presence of the Lares, their <seg lang="la">bulla</seg> and <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, or purpleedged toga, and put on the unadorned <seg lang="la">toga virilis.</seg> They were then, after a sacrifice at home, taken by their fathers or guardians, accompanied by friends and relations, to the Forum and enrolled in the lists of citizens. The boys were from this time, in the eyes of the law, capable of marriage, bound to military service, and, in fact, had now entered upon their <seg lang="la">tirocinium</seg>, which was regarded as the last stage of education. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstirocinium">Tirocinium</ref>.</p>
 <p>After the time of Vespasian the higher public instruction began to be a matter of imperial concern. Vespasian paid away the sum of $4250 annually to the Latin and Greek rhetoricians in Rome. Hadrian founded the Athenaeum, the first known public institution for the higher education, with salaried teachers. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenaeum">Athenaeum</ref>.) After his time philosophers, rhetoricians, and grammarians were publicly appointed to lecture in all the larger cities of the Empire. They were maintained partly at the expense of the respective communities, partly by the emperors, and enjoyed in all cases certain immunities conferred by the State.

 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Higher Education</hi>.—In the days of the Roman Empire there existed at Athens and some of the other Greek cities what closely corresponded to the universities of modern times. Athens had always been what Pericles called “the school of Greece;” and in the early centuries of the Christian era it contained an organized faculty (<foreign lang="greek">χορός, συνουσία, ἀγέλη</foreign>) of accomplished professors, who lectured to a body of students drawn from every quarter of the civilized world. The university at Athens was gradually formed as the result of two previously existing institutions—the Ephebi (<foreign lang="greek">ἔφηβοι</foreign>) and the schools of the philosophers and sophists. The Ephebi, or free Athenian youths, were in early times enrolled as a body primarily intended for the defence of the State. They were educated <cb /> both physically and mentally, and they formed the nucleus of what afterwards became the student body of the university. Two changes in the constitution of the Ephebi prepared the way for their transformation from a quasi-military body into a university. These changes were (1) the neglect of the principle of compulsory enrollment, and</p>
 <p>(2) the fact that membership ceased to be confined to Athenians or even to Greeks alone.</p>
 <p>These changes left a body of young men, organized and regularly enrolled, free to follow such a course of training as best suited their inclinations and capacities, and ready to be turned to any line of study that had the advocacy of brilliant, energetic, and popular men. The schools of the philosophers supplied the influence necessary for completing the change from a military college to a great university.</p>
 <p>Four schools of philosophy had, since the time of the Macedonian wars, been flourishing at Athens. These were the Academic or Platonic School, the Peripatetic or Aristotelian School, the Stoic School, and the Epicurean. Each of these schools from the time of its foundation had received an endowment sufficient to maintain and perpetuate it. <ref type="cross" target="crossplato">Plato</ref> (q.v.) had purchased a small garden near the Eleusinian Way, in the grove of Academé, for 3000 drachmas. His philosophic successors, Xenocrates and Polemon, continued to teach in the same spot; their wealthy pupils and other friends of learning added to the grounds, and bequeathed sufficient funds for the support of the philosopher, and thus practically endowed an academic chair (<foreign lang="greek">θρόνος</foreign>). Later we find that the endowment of this chair had so increased that its annual income was 7000 <seg lang="la">aurei.</seg> In like manner Aristotle (q. v.) left to his successor, Theophrastus, the valuable property near the Ilissus; and Theophrastus, in the will whose text has come down to us in Diogenes Laertius (v. 2, 14), completed the permanent endowment of the Peripatetic chair. So Epicurus left his property in the Ceramicus to be the nucleus of an endowment for his school ( <bibl n="Diog.  20. 10" default="NO">Diog. Laert.xx. 10</bibl>), and the Stoics were probably in like manner made independent. Around these four schools of philosophy which, being endowed, taught gratuitously, a multitude of teachers of rhetoric, grammar, literature, logic, physics, and mathematics clustered, and many chairs were endowed by the Roman emperors. The world soon learned to think of Athens as a great seat of learning and culture, brilliant and renowned. Students flocked to her from every quarter of the world. It appears to have been necessary to become enrolled among the Ephebi, but the scholars selected for themselves their own instructors, and attended such lectures as they chose. The number of these students became enormous. Theophrastus alone lectured to as many as two thousand men. The records show the names of many foreign students, some of them being of the Semitic race. The most noted writers of Rome had studied at this university, of whom Cicero, Ovid, and Horace are perhaps the most brilliant names. The customs of the university may be gathered from a perusal of the works of Aulus Gellius, Libanius (A.D. 314), and Philostratus, author of the <foreign lang="greek">Βίοι Σοφιστῶν</foreign> (A.D. 250). From these sources we learn that matriculation took place early in the year; that the students wore a gown (<foreign lang="greek">τρίβων</foreign>) like that of the undergraduates at the English universities; that they pursued athletic 
<pb n="573" /><cb />
 sports with much ardour; that at the theatre a special gallery was reserved for them; that certificates of attendance at the courses of lectures were required; that they were under the general direction of a president (<foreign lang="greek">κοσμητής</foreign>); that fees were exacted in the shape of an annual contribution to the university library; that breaches of discipline were punished, as at Oxford, by fines; that the relation between student and professor was very close, so that for a student to cease to take a course was very cutting; and that the students themselves “touted” for the professors. “Most of the young enthusiasts for learning,” says Gregory Nanzianzen, “become mere partisans of their professors. They are all anxiety to get their audiences larger and their fees increased. This they carry to portentous lengths. They post themselves over the city at the beginning of the year; as each new comer disembarks he falls into their hands; they carry him off at once to the house of some countryman or friend who is best at trumpeting the praises of his own professor” (Libanius, i. 13).</p>
 <p>Private tutors (<foreign lang="greek">φύλακες</foreign>) were often employed. They looked over the students' notes, “coached” them on the subjects in which they were most interested, and helped them at their exercises. At the end of the year there seems to have been an examination (<foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασία</foreign>).</p>
 <p>Freshmen appear to have been subject to a sort of hazing (<foreign lang="greek">τελεταί</foreign>). Gregory, in a funeral address over his friend Basil, recalls some of the memories of their sport with freshmen. We find one of the professors, Proaeresius, asking his class not to haze a new student, Eunapius, because of his feeble health. Sometimes the inferior officers of the university were subjected to similar annoyances, and Libanius tells of one of the tutors who was tossed in a blanket, an exercise known to the Romans as <hi rend="italic">sagatio.</hi></p>
 <p>Many of the coincidences between ancient and modern university life are interesting. The following is a quotation from Libanius, who gives an account of how his classes conducted themselves:</p>
 <p>“I send my proctor to summon the students to my lecture, but they are in no mood to hurry, though they ought to be. They stay outside to sing songs which we have all heard till we are tired, or else amuse themselves with foolish merriment and jesting. This they do until the lecture has actually begun. Then they come in and keep whispering to one another, to the annoyance of the real students, about the races, or actresses, or opera-dancers; or about some contest either past or future.” And he adds, very naïvely, “I had a very different class of students once. Perhaps some one may say that the fault is mine, and that my lectures are not as good as they used to be; but some of my best students now do not think so; they declare solemnly that I now quite surpass myself; and that while my lectures were always admirable, there is more in them now than there ever was before” (i. 199).</p>
 <p>Schools of philosophy and letters similar to those at Athens sprang up at other great cities in the later Roman Empire—at Constantinople, at Rhodes, at Scepsis in the Troad, Massilia (Marseilles), Tarsus, and especially at Alexandria, which last city was definitely designed by the Ptolemies to be a centre of scientific research and investigation, to which end they gave it a magnificent library <cb /> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbibliotheca">Bibliotheca</ref>), handsome buildings, and ample endowments.</p>

 <p>As the name <foreign lang="greek">τοιχωρύχος</foreign> implies, the Greek burglar sought to effect an entrance through the wall of a house, rather than through the doors or windows.

There was another fountain of Egeria in the precincts of Diana at Aricia. In Roman legend, Egeria was the consort and counsellor of King Numa, who used to meet her in a grotto in the precincts of the Camenae. After the death of her lover she fled to the shrine of the Arician Diana, by whom, as her wailings disturbed the worship,

Egnatia was situated on the high-road from Rome to Brundisium, which from Egnatia to Brundisium bore the name of the Via Egnatia. The continuation of this road on the other side of the Adriatic from Dyrrhachium to Byzantium also bore the name of Via Egnatia. It was the great military road between Italy and the East. Commencing at Dyrrhachium, it passed by Lychnidus, Heraclea, Lyncestis, Edessa, Thessalonica, Amphipolis, Philippi, and traversing the whole of Thrace, finally reached Byzantium. Egnatia is called Gnatia in Horace by a popular contraction like that which gives us “Frisco” for San Francisco.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγγελία</foreign>). Properly, an announcement made in presence of a legal authority. In Attic jurisprudence it was a special form of public prosecution, instituted especially for offences which appeared to inflict injury, directly or indirectly, upon the State, but which it was impracticable to prosecute under the regular and customary procedure. The accusation was put into writing and handed in to the Senate; if the Senate received it the accused was arrested, or had to get three persons to stand surety for him. But if the charge were one of treason or an attack upon the constitution this was not allowed. If the voting on the guilt or innocence of the accused were unfavourable, the Senate itself fixed the penalty, supposing it fell short of the amount which lay within its competence (500 drachmae, or $83). If not, the Senate referred the case at once to one of the courts of the Heliaea, or even to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησία</foreign>, or Assembly, to which the prosecutor might, indeed, have applied from the first. If the <seg lang="la">ecclesia</seg> decided to take up the case, the first thing it did was to fix the penalty in case there were no legal provisions on this point.

<head orig="Elagabălus">Elagabalus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Elagabal</hi>, a deity among the Phoenicians. This deity, according to Capitolinus ( <bibl n="Luc. Macr. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Macr.</title>9</bibl>) and Aurelius Victor, was the Sun. Lampridius, however, fluctuates between the Sun and Iupiter, while Spartianus (<title>Caracall.</title> 11) leaves it uncertain. The orthography of the name is also disputed, some writing it Elagabal, others Eleagabal and Alagabal. Herodian gives us an accurate description of the form under which this deity was worshipped (v. 3, 10 foll.); he also informs us that by this appellation the Sun was meant, and that the deity in question was revered not only by the Syrians, but that the native satraps and barbarian kings were accustomed to send splendid presents to his shrine. According to Herodian, the god Elagabalus was worshipped under the form of a large black stone, round below and terminating above in a point— in other words, of a conical shape. This description is confirmed by the medals of Emesa, the principal seat of his worship, on which the conical stone is represented. So also, on the medals of Antoninus Pius, struck in this same city, an eagle appears perched on a cone. The same thing appears on medals of Caracalla, and on one an eagle with expanded wings stands before a conical stone in the middle of a hexastyle temple.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Aurelius Antonīnus</hi>, a Roman emperor. He was the grandson of Maesa, sister to the empress Iulia, the wife of Septimius Severus. Maesa had two daughters, Soaemias or Semiamira, the mother of the subject of this <cb /> <figure id="fig.00575">
<head orig="Elagabalus. (Bust in the Capitol, Rome.)">Elagabalus. (Bust in the Capitol, Rome.)</head>
</figure> article, and Mammaea, mother of Alexander Severus. The true name of Elagabalus was Varius Avitus Bassianus, and he was reported to have been the illegitimate son of Caracalla. He was born at Antioch, A.D. 204. Maesa took care of his infancy, and placed him, when five years of age, in the temple of the Sun at Emesa, to be educated as a priest; and through her influence he was made, while yet a boy, high-priest of the Sun. That divinity was called in Syria Elagabal, whence the young Varius assumed the name of Elagabalus. After the death of Caracalla and the elevation of Macrinus, the latter having incurred by his severity the dislike of the soldiers, Maesa availed herself of this feeling to induce the officers to rise in favour of her grandson, whom she presented to them as the son of the murdered Caracalla. Elagabalus, who was then in his fifteenth year, was proclaimed emperor by the legion stationed at Emesa. Having put himself at their head, he was attacked by Macrinus, who at first had the advantage; but he and his mother Soaemias, with great spirit, brought the soldiers again to the charge and defeated Macrinus, who was overtaken in his flight and put to death, A.D. 218. Elagabalus, having entered Antioch, wrote a letter to the Senate, professing to take for his model Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, a name revered at Rome; and he also assumed that emperor's name. The Senate acknowledged him, and he set out for Rome, but delayed for several months on his way amid festivities and amusements, and at last stopped at Nicomedia for the winter. In the following year he arrived at Rome and began a career of debauchery, extravagance, and cruelty which lasted the remaining three years of his reign, and the disgusting details of which are given by Lampridius, Herodian, and Dio Cassius. He surrounded himself with gladiators, actors, and other base favourites, who made an unworthy use of their influence. He married several wives, among others a Vestal. 
<pb n="576" /><cb /> The imperial palace became a scene of debauch and open prostitution. Elagabalus, being attached to the superstitions of the East, raised a temple on the Palatine Hill to the Syrian god whose name he bore, and plundered the temples of the Roman gods to enrich his own. He put to death many senators, and established a senate of women, under the presidency of his mother, Soaemias, which body decided all questions relative to women's dresses, and to visits, precedence, and amusements. He wore his pontifical vest as high-priest of the Sun, with a rich tiara on his head. His grandmother Maesa, seeing his folly, thought of conciliating the Romans by associating with him, as Caesar, his younger cousin, Alexander Severus, who soon became a favourite with the people. Elagabalus, who had consented to the association, became afterwards jealous of his cousin and wished to deprive him of his honours, but he could not obtain the consent of the Senate. His next measure was to spread the report of Alexander's death, which produced an insurrection among the praetorians; and Elagabalus, having repaired to the camp to quell the mutiny, was murdered, together with his mother and his favourites, and his body was thrown into the Tiber, A.D. 222. He was succeeded by Alexander Severus. Elagabalus was eighteen years of age at the time of his death, and had reigned three years, nine months, and four days (Lamprid. <title>Elagab.;</title> Herodian, v. 3 foll.; Dio Cass. lxxviii. 31 foll.; lxxix. 1 foll.).

There Orestes formed the well-known attachment for his cousin Pylades, which, in the end, led to the marriage of Electra with that prince. According to one account, Electra had previously been compelled, by Aegisthus, to become the wife of a Mycenean rustic, who, having regarded her merely as a sacred trust confided to him by the gods, restored her to Orestes on the return of that prince to Mycenae and on his accession to the throne of his ancestors. Electra became, by Pylades, the mother of two sons, Strophius and Medon.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἤλεκτρος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἤλεκτρον</foreign>). Lepsius has maintained (<title>Ueber die Metalle in den ägypt. Inschriften</title>, Appendix) that the early Greek usage was to employ the masculine form when the mixture of gold and silver was intended; the neuter form when the mineral which we call amber was meant. It is likely that the Greeks were acquainted in very early times with the use of amber, trade in this mineral having taken place in pre-historic days between North and South Europe. They must also have been early acquainted with the compounded metal, since gold alike in Asia and Europe is commonly found mixed with silver. Which of the two substances, therefore, was first called electrum is a matter quite open to dispute. They will be spoken of in turn.</p>
 <p>(1) <ref type="cross" target="crossamber">Amber</ref>. Beads of amber were found in the royal tombs at Mycenae, and chemical analysis (Schliemann, <title>Tiryns</title>, p. 370) has proved that this amber came from the Baltic and not from elsewhere. Similar beads have also been found in the very early tombs at Ialysus in Rhodes. At a later period amber is mentioned in the <title>Odyssey</title> (xv. 460, xviii. 295) as a material of necklaces. In one of these passages the necklace is spoken of as an import from Phoenicia. It is also stated (iv. 73) that the walls of the palace of Menelaüs were adorned with amber, as well as with gold, silver, and ivory. The author of the <title>Shield of Heracles</title>, ascribed to Hesiod, speaks of that shield (141) as adorned with electrum, in which case, however, the metal may be meant. In South Italy amber was used in the archaic period as a material for statuettes and reliefs; many specimens of this kind of work are in the British Museum. It is probable that the amber of early Greece was imported by the Phoenicians who sailed round the coast to the north of Europe, especially in view of the fact that after the Homeric Age amber disappeared from Greek tombs, and does not again figure until Roman times, when a regular trade with the Baltic coast had sprung up.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mixed Gold and Silver</hi>. The earliest certain mention of this mixed metal as electrum (rather <foreign lang="greek">ἤλεκτρος</foreign>) is in Sophocles's <title>Antigone</title>, 1037, 
<pb n="577" /><cb />
 where the substance is said to come from Sardis; for Sardis by the Pactolus was noted in antiquity as the place whence came the river-gold, mixed when found with a considerable percentage of silver. Herodotus, however, speaking of this same Sardian metal in connection with the donaria of Croesus to Delphi (i. 50), calls it white gold, <foreign lang="greek">λευκὸς χρυσός</foreign>. Pliny remarks ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  80" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 80</bibl>) that gold is invariably found mixed with silver (which is true), and that when the proportion of silver reaches a fifth the metal is called electrum. He adds that electrum was made by art as well as found.</p>
 <p>This white gold or electrum is used on the sword-blades found at Mycenae for purposes of inlaying. In later times it was used, as being a harder material than gold, for objects in which hardness was desirable. By far the most important use to which it was put was as a material for coins.</p>
 <p>In the seventh century B.C., or possibly late in the eighth, the kings of Lydia began to issue stamped money of electrum, using probably the metal in its natural state, and the maritime cities of the Asiatic coast and of Euboea adopted the idea. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspondera">Pondera</ref>.) For some time, until silver <figure id="fig.00577">

</figure> was first minted at Aegina, all the coinage of the world consisted of stamped pellets of electrum, though no doubt unstamped bars of gold and silver circulated with them. It is observed by Mr. Head (<title>Numismatic Chronicle</title>, 1875, p. 254), in his account of early electrum coins, that the mixed metal had two advantages over pure gold in circulation: (1) it was more durable;</p>
 <p>(2) the proportionate value of gold to silver being 13 1/3 to 1 (Herodotus says 13), and electrum being of three-fourths the value of gold, each coin of electrum would pass as the equivalent of ten silver bars of equal weight.</p>
 <p>Croesus is believed to have first introduced into Asia coined money of gold and silver in place of electrum. See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumismatics">Numismatics</ref>.

<head orig="Elegīa">Elegia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλεγεῖον</foreign>, a distich consisting of an hexameter line followed by a pentameter; then in the plural, a collection of such distichs, and hence <foreign lang="greek">ἐλεγεία</foreign>). The general term in Greek for any poem written in the elegiac metre, a combination of the dactylic hexameter and pentameter in a couplet. The word <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγος</foreign> is probably not Greek, but borrowed from the Lydians, and means a plaintive melody accompanied by the flute. How it happened that the word was applied to elegiac poetry, the earliest representatives of which by no means confined it to mournful subjects, is doubtful. It may be that the term was chosen only in reference to the musical setting, the elegy having originally been accompanied by the flute. Like the epic, the <cb /> elegy was a production of the Ionians of Asia Minor. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepos">Epos</ref>.) Its dialect was the same as that of the epos, and its metre only a variation of the epic metre, the pentameter being no more than an abbreviation of the hexameter. The elegy marks the first transition from the epic to lyric proper. The earliest representatives of the elegy, Callinus of Ephesus (about B.C. 700) and Tyrtaeus of Aphidnae in Attica (about B.C. 600), gave it a decidedly warlike and political direction, and so did Solon (B.C. 640-559) in his earlier poems, though his later elegies have mostly a contemplative character. The elegies of Theognis of Megara (about B.C. 540), though gnomic and erotic, are essentially political. The first typical representative of the erotic elegy was Mimnermus of Colophon, an elder contemporary of Solon. The elegy of mourning or sorrow was brought to perfection by <ref type="cross" target="crosssimonides">Simonides</ref> (q.v.) of Ceos (died B.C. 469). After him the emotional element predominated. Antimachus of Colophon (about B.C. 400) gave the elegy a learned tinge, and was thus the prototype of the elegiac poets of Alexandria, Phanocles, Philetas of Cos, Hermesianax of Colophon, and <ref type="cross" target="crosscallimachus">Callimachus</ref> (q.v.) of Cyrené, the master of them all. The subject of the Alexandrian elegy is sometimes the passion of love, with its pains and pleasures, treated through the medium of images and similes taken from mythology; sometimes learned narrative of fable and history, from which personal emotion is absent.</p>
 <p>This type of elegy, with its learned and obscure manner, was taken up and imitated at Rome towards the end of the Republic. The Romans soon easily surpassed their Greek masters both in warmth and sincerity of feeling and in finish of style. The elegies of Catullus are among their earliest attempts; but in the Augustan Age, in the hands of Cornelius Gallus , Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid, the elegiac style was entirely appropriated by Latin literature. Ovid, in his <title>Fasti</title>, showed how a learned subject could be treated in this metre. From his time onward the elegiac metre was constantly employed, and was used even in schools for practice in style. In the later literature it was applied, like the epic metre, to every possible subject, as, for instance, by Rutilius Namatianus in the description of his return from Rome to Gaul (A.D. 416). In the sixth century A.D. the poet Maximianus, born in Etruria at the beginning of that century, is a late instance of a genuine elegiac poet.</p>

<div2 id="crosseleusinia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eleusinia">Eleusinia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ἐλευσίνια</foreign>). A title chiefly applied to a festival held by the Athenians in the autumn, in honour of Demeter, Persephoné, and Iacchus, consisting of sacrifices, processions, and certain mystical ceremonies. It was one of the most important festivals of Greece.</p>
 <p>The mythical origin of the Eleusinia is contained in the Homeric hymn to Demeter, which tells how Persephoné, while gathering flowers, was, with the connivance of Zeus, carried off by the god of the lower world, Hades or Polydegmon (the great receiver); and how her mother Demeter, daughter of Rhea, searching distractedly for her child, is advised by Hecaté to consult Helios, who sees all things; and how Helios in pity tells her that Zeus has granted to Hades to carry off her daughter to be his wife. Forthwith Demeter changes herself into an old woman; and as she wanders forth disconsolate through the world she comes to Eleusis, and sits down on the cheerless stone by a well. The daughters of Celeus, the king of Eleusis, come to the well to draw water. They bring her to their home, where Metanira, wife of Celeus, gives her the latest born child, Demophoön, to nurse. But Demeter is still bowed down with grief; she sits dignified but silent in her room, till the jests and raillery of Iambé, the servant-maid, at last make her smile. She consents to take food and drink, but will have no wine, only a mixture (<foreign lang="greek">κυκεών</foreign>) of water with barley-meal and mint. Days go on, and the child Demophoön thrives beyond what mortal child was wont, for a goddess was his nurse; she used to anoint him daily with ambrosia and place him in the fire by night. But a little more time and the child would have been immortal, when one night Metanira saw the nurse place him in the fire and cried aloud with terror. Then the anger of Demeter blazed forth, and the aged nurse transformed herself into the goddess, told who she was, what she had intended to do, and how that the little faith of the mother had robbed the child of immortality, and finally bade the people of Eleusis to erect a temple for her on the hill above the fountain, when she herself would prescribe the services they must perform in order to gain her favour. They did so, and Demeter dwelt there, shunning all association with the other gods who had been parties to the carrying off of her daughter. For a year Demeter dwelt there—a year of want, for nothing grew; and the human race would have perished, had not Zeus agreed that Persephoné should return. Gladly did Persephoné obey the summons of Hermes; but Hades persuaded her to eat a pomegranate seed before she left, and that prevented her staying away from him for a whole year. So Persephoné returns, and great is the joy of mother and daughter, in which the faithful Hecaté sympathizes. Rhea is then sent down by Zeus to her daughter and effects the reconciliation. The corn comes up in abundance in the Rarian plain; Demeter returns to Olympus to dwell with the gods, and prescribes to Celeus and to his sons Triptolemus, Diocles, and Eumolpus the solemnities and divine services that were in future time to be paid her; and hence the famous Eleusinian Mysteries were a 
<pb n="579" /><cb />
 direct appointment of the great goddess Demeter herself.</p>
 <p>Such was the story of the origin of the mysteries; but how the mysteries came to be Athenian depends on another story, which concerns the union of Eleusis with Athens. Erechtheus warred with the Eleusinians (Pausan. i. 38, 3), who were helped by one Eumolpus, a Thracian, son of Poseidon ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.14.4" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.14.4</bibl>) and founder of the mysteries (Lucian, <bibl n="Luc. Demon. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Demon.</title>34</bibl>). The difficulties connected with the exact birthplace and genealogical position of Eumolpus (see Roscher, <title>Lexikon der Mythol.</title> s. v. <title>Eumolpus</title>) we may pass over, remembering that he is, according to this legend, a foreigner ( <title>De Exsilio</title>, p. 607, 10). Eleusis was conquered, and to the Athenians fell the political headship, but to the family of Eumolpus and the daughters of the Eleusinian king Celeus was assigned the highpriesthood (<foreign lang="greek">ἱεροφαντία</foreign>) of the Eleusinian worship. The other family which held a priesthood in the mysteries, the Kerykes, were said to have been descended from Keryx, the son of Eumolpus; though the family itself considered its ancestors to have been Hermes and Aglauros, daughter of Erechtheus, and so genuine Athenians (Pausan. i. 38, 3).</p>
 <p>Mysteries were celebrated in honour of Demeter, Persephoné, and Dionysus in Asia Minor (e. g. at Cyzicus); in Egypt on Lake Mareotis ( <bibl n="Strab.  17." default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.xvii.</bibl> p. 800); in Sicily at Gela and elsewhere ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 153" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 153</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod.  5. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.

But the most splendid and important of all the Eleusinia were those of Attica, which may be regarded as having consisted of two parts: (1) the Lesser Mysteries at Agrae, and</p>
 <p>(2) the Greater Mysteries at Eleusis.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Lesser Mysteries at Agrae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐν Ἀγραις</foreign>). These were held in the spring at Agrae, a place on the Ilissus, southeast of the Acropolis. <figure id="fig.00579">
<head orig="Initiation of Heracles. (Vase from Panticapaeum.)">Initiation of Heracles. (Vase from Panticapaeum.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> There is no doubt that they were held in the month Anthesterion, when there were the first signs of returning vegetation just after field-work began (<title>C. I. G.</title> 103, 1. 20). The exact date cannot be fixed, but Mommsen's suggestion is most probable, that the chief day was the 20th, the same day of the month as the Greater Mysteries were held on in Boedromion, to which the Lesser Mysteries had many points of similarity, even in matters connected with the calendar—e. g. the same length of the mystery truce (<title>C. I. G.</title> 71). Mommsen supposes that the 19th was a day of preparation, and the 20th and 21st the special mystery days. These Lesser Mysteries were considered as a prelude to the Greater (Schol. on <title>Plut.</title> 845), being on a much smaller scale; but initiation in the Lesser was generally required before the candidate could present himself for initiation into the Greater ( <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497" default="NO" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Gorg.</title>497</bibl>C). The mysteries at Agrae consisted probably to a large extent of purifications, for which the water of the Ilissus was much used ( <bibl n="Polyaen.  5. 17" default="NO">Polyaen.v. 17</bibl>). They were held more especially in honour of Persephoné, called Pherrephatta here, than of Demeter (Schol. on <title>Plut.</title> 845). It appears that the carrying off of Persephoné was the most important representation in these mysteries. Again we hear that at Agrae the fate of Dionysus was pourtrayed (<foreign lang="greek">μίμημα τῶν περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον</foreign>, Steph. Byzant. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Ἄγραι</foreign>). The death of Dionysus-Zagreus took place on the 13th of Anthesterion, the day on which the festival of the Chytri was held (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>); so perhaps on the ninth day after, the 21st (for funeral rites on the ninth day after death, the <foreign lang="greek">ἔνατα</foreign>, see <title>Ctesiph.</title> 225), the funeral ceremony may have been held and his violent death related in a drama. A great many, especially strangers, were initiated into these mysteries who did not proceed to initiation into the regular Eleusinia; the legend, too, said it was for the purpose of initiating 
<pb n="580" /><cb /> Heracles, who was a stranger and according to the primitive regulations could not be initiated into the Eleusinia, that these Lesser Mysteries were established (Schol. on <title>Plut.</title> 845, 1013).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Greater Mysteries at Eleusis</hi>. Two days are fixed by definite evidence—viz. the 16th Boëdromion for the <foreign lang="greek">Ἅλαδε μύσται</foreign> ( <bibl n="Polyaen.  3. 11" default="NO">Polyaen.iii. 11</bibl><bibl n="Polyaen.  11" default="NO">Polyaen., 11</bibl>; <title>De Glor.

Phoc. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Phoc.</title>28</bibl>). The fixing of other days depends on conjecture, but can be determined with a considerable degree of certainty. A month before the middle of Boëdromion—i. e. the middle of Metageitnion—the <foreign lang="greek">σπονδοφόροι</foreign> used to announce the mystery truce to the neighbouring States ( <title>Fals. Leg.</title> 133), so as to give the strangers time to make all arrangements necessary for a visit to Athens. During the latter portion of this month the votary who intended to be initiated used to betake himself to some private man who had gone through all the grades of initiation, was examined by him as to his freedom from sin, received instruction as to what purifications and offerings were necessary to gain the favour of the goddesses, and submitted the actual offerings for his inspection and approval. This instructor was the <foreign lang="greek">μυσταγωγός</foreign>. He certified to the Hierophant the fitness of the applicant and introduced him, this proceeding being apparently called <foreign lang="greek">σύστασις</foreign>. Sincere devotees appear to have fasted for nine days (cf.  <bibl n="HH 2 47" default="NO" valid="yes">HH <title>Hymn. Dem.</title>47</bibl>), from the 13th to the 21st—i. e. ate nothing during the day, taking whatever food they did take between sunset and sunrise, like the Mahomedans during Ramadan; and votaries generally appear to have abstained from domestic birds, fish, pomegranates, apples, and beans ( <bibl n="Porph. Abst. 4. 16" default="NO">Porphyr. <title>Abst.</title>iv. 16</bibl>). On the 15th of Boëdromion the formal assemblage (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγυρμός</foreign>, Hesych. s. v.) was held of those citizens and strangers who intended to take part in the mysteries—though this assemblage does not appear to have been absolutely essential, at least in late times (<title>C. I. G.</title> 523). At the beginning of the 16th, in the evening (the day is reckoned from sunset to sunset), Chabrias's distribution of wine to the people in honour of his victory at Naxos used to take place ( <bibl n="Plut. Phoc. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Phoc.</title>6</bibl>); and the next morning began the first formal act of the festival—viz. the <foreign lang="greek">πρόρρησις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Ἅλαδε μύσται</foreign>. A proclamation was made by the Archon Basileus ( <bibl n="Poll.  8. 90" default="NO">Poll.viii. 90</bibl>) and by the Hierophant and Daduchus in the Stoa Poecilé (Schol. on <title>Ran.</title> 369), for the departure of all strangers and all murderers; and then the order for purification given, “Ye mystae, to the sea!” The “sea” was sometimes the Piraeus ( <bibl n="Plut. Phoc. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Phoc.</title>28</bibl>), though probably only in time of Attica being occupied by enemies; but generally the <foreign lang="greek">Ῥειτοί</foreign>, two salt streams on the Sacred Road, one dedicated to Demeter, the other to Coré, which contained fish that the priests alone were allowed to eat (Pausan. i. 38, 1; Hesych. s. v.). The next day, the 17th, sacrifices (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερεῖα</foreign>) were offered for the safety of the State by the Archon Basileus and the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμεληταί</foreign> in the Eleusinium at Athens; and at all these sacrifices the <foreign lang="greek">θεωροί</foreign> of foreign States seem to have taken part (Eurip. <title>Suppl.</title> 173). The night of the 18th may have been spent by the very devout in sleeping in the Temple of Aesculapius, southwest of the Acropolis, or in the Iaccheum (Boeckh on <title>C. I. G.</title> 481), also called the Temple of Demeter. It was just where the road from the Piraeus entered <cb /> Athens (Pausan. i. 2, 4). The early morning of that day till about 9 <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.m</hi>. was devoted to ordinary business, as we find decrees issued bearing that date (Mommsen, pp. 95, 225, 226). After this hour the Epidauria was celebrated in the Temple of Demeter or Iacchus and in the Temple of Aesculapius. It was, as has been seen, a supplementary sacrifice for those who came late, and legend said it was instituted for the sake of Aesculapius, who himself came late for the mysteries. Doubtless, however, the thought really lay in this, that Aesculapius was supposed by his wondrous skill to have raised again Iacchus from the dead, and the festival probably was incorporated in the Eleusinia when the worship of Epidaurus became connected with that of Athens ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 82" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 82</bibl>). Meanwhile there were being brought from Eleusis certain religious objects—playthings, it was said, of the child Iacchus —bone (<foreign lang="greek">ἀστράγαλος</foreign>), top (<foreign lang="greek">στρόβιλος</foreign>), ball (<foreign lang="greek">σφαῖρα</foreign>), apples (<foreign lang="greek">μῆλα</foreign>), tambourine (<foreign lang="greek">ῥόμβος</foreign>), looking-glass (<foreign lang="greek">ἔσοπτρον</foreign>), fleece (<foreign lang="greek">πόκος</foreign>), fan (<foreign lang="greek">λίκνον</foreign>), and such like, as is learned from Clement of Alexandria (<title>Protrept.</title> p. 15, ed. Potter; cf. Lobeck, <title>Aglaoph.</title> 701, 702). Phalli were perhaps also carried among these mystical objects (see <ref type="cross" target="crossphallus">Phallus</ref>); but we must remember that the statue of Iacchus, as we shall see, which was carried in procession to Eleusis on the 19th, was not kept at Eleusis during the year, but at Athens, having been brought back some day shortly after the conclusion of the mysteries; for there was no Iaccheum at Eleusis (Mommsen, p. 253). The Athenian Ephebi met this convoy at the Temple of Echo (evidence from inscriptions in Mommsen, p. 252), and conveyed it to Athens by nightfall. In the early morning of the 19th, there were occasionally decrees passed. In the forenoon the Iacchus procession started from the Eleusinium and proceeded to the Iaccheum, where they got the statue of Iacchus; perhaps then definitely organized the procession in the building assigned for that purpose (Pausan. i. 2, 4); and then passing through the Ceramicus (Schol. on <title>Ran.</title> 399) left Athens by the Sacred Gate ( <bibl n="Plut. Sull. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sull.</title>14</bibl>), priests and people crowned with myrtle and ivy, the rich ladies till the time of the orator Lycurgus riding in carriages (Schol. on <bibl default="NO"><title>Plut.</title> 1014</bibl>). The statue of Iacchus was probably that of a fair child crowned with myrtle and holding a torch, hence called <foreign lang="greek">φωσφόρος ἀστὴρ</foreign> in Aristophanes (<title>Ran.</title> 342). There were many ceremonies to be performed as the procession passed along the Sacred Way to Eleusis— ceremonies which had to be given up during the Peloponnesian War, while Attica was invaded by the Peloponnesians ( <title>Alcib.</title> 34). One section of the procession repaired to the Cephissus and took baths therein, another to the bath by Anemocritus's statue near the tomb of Scirus the soothsayer, who came from Dodona to Eleusis to assist the Eleusinians in the war against Erechtheus and was slain. The Phytalidae sacrificed to Phytalus in Laciadae, where lay a temple to the Mourning (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχέα</foreign>) Demeter, and to Coré, with whose worship that of Athené and Poseidon was joined (Pausan. i. 37, 2). At the palace of Crocon, the Croconidae perhaps bound small bands of saffron thread round the right wrist and right foot of each mystes (cf. Phot. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">κροκοῦν</foreign>), which was considered as a protection from the evil eye.</p>
 <p>Occasionally during the procession the majority of those who took part in it indulged in flouts and gibes at one another, a proceeding called <foreign lang="greek">γεφυρισμός</foreign>, 
<pb n="581" /><cb /> the origin of which title is unknown, but is generally associated with the bridge over the Cephissus ( <bibl n="Strab.  9. 400" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.ix. 400</bibl>). Chants in honour of Iacchus were sung constantly during the procession, which swelled louder as when, near midnight, Iacchus arrived at Eleusis amid the blaze of torches (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1045" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Col.</title> 1045</bibl>). That the procession did not arrive till late at night is plain from the splendid chorus in the  <title>Ion</title>(1076 foll.), which sings of the torches and of the moon and stars dancing in heaven at the sight. The journey from Athens to Eleusis is really only four hours long, but the various ceremonies performed during the course of the procession extended it to three or four times its normal length. On the next morning certain sacrifices were performed, consisting probably in part of swine, to Demeter (Schol. on <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 374" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 374</bibl>). An inscription in Mommsen, p. 257, orders sacrifices to be made by the <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign> to Hermes Enagonius, the Graces, Artemis, and certain heroes, Telesidromus and Triptolemus. It is not known what these sacrifices were at Eleusis; at Andania they were, besides others, a sheep to Persephoné and a sow to Demeter. In later times the Ephebi made supplementary sacrifices of cattle. The bulls were brought unbound to the altar, and the Ephebi struggled with them to hold them as they were being sacrificed.</p>
 <p>The 22d and 23d were the <foreign lang="greek">μυστηριώτιδες ἡμέραι</foreign>, and the ceremonies celebrated thereon were <foreign lang="greek">παννυχίδες</foreign>. During the evening of the 22d was probably what was called <foreign lang="greek">λαμπάδων ἡμέρα</foreign>, which consisted of a symbol of search after Coré with torches (Lactant. <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 1. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>i. 21</bibl>), performed principally by and for the less highly initiated, who conducted the search crowned with myrtle, wearing a fawn-skin, and holding a wand, the mystagogues of the several initiates taking part in the search —the whole proceeding being perhaps an interlude in the story of Demeter and Coré, which appears to have been represented in the temple on this night. After it, came with much ceremonial the partaking of the <foreign lang="greek">κυκεών</foreign>, a mixture of mint, barley-meal, and water. This was a cardinal feature in the ceremony, being, if we may so say, a participation in the Eleusinian sacrament. It was in remembrance of Demeter being refreshed after her long wandering and fruitless search. Thereafter followed what was called the <foreign lang="greek">παράδοσις τῶν ἱερῶν</foreign> (Suidas, s. v.): certain relics and amulets were given to the votary to touch or kiss or even taste, the votary repeating, as the priest tendered him the objects with a regular question (Arnob. <title>Adv. Gentes</title>, v. 26), a formula (<foreign lang="greek">σύνθημα</foreign>), given by Clement of Alexandria (<title>Protrept.</title> p. 18). It appears that some kind of memento of this ceremony was given by the priest to the votaries, which a sincere believer used to keep in a linen cloth ( Apul. <title>Apol.</title>p. 140). The actual <foreign lang="greek">ἱερὰ</foreign> themselves were kept in a chest (<foreign lang="greek">τελέτης ἐγκύμονα μυστίδα κίστην</foreign>, Nonnus, <title>Dionys.</title> ix. 127) bound with purple ribbons, and consisted among others of sesame cakes of particular shapes, pomegranates, salt, ferules, ivy, poppy-seeds, quinces, etc. ( <title>Protrept.</title> p. 19): the uninitiated were not allowed to see these “even from the housetop” (Callim. <title>Hymn to Ceres</title>, 4).</p>
 <p>Not very different appear to have been the ceremonies of the 23d. There were many wand-bearers but few bacchants, as the superintendents of the mysteries used to say (Plato, <bibl n="Sen. Phaed. 69" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phaed.</title>69</bibl>C), and <cb /> it was for these latter, the more highly initiated mystae of at least a year's standing, generally called <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόπται</foreign>, that the ceremonies of the 23d were held, and they were the highest and greatest. Here, too, was probably a <foreign lang="greek">παράδοσις τῶν ἱερῶν</foreign>, the sacramental words used in receiving which being <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τυμπάνου ἔφαγον, ἐκ κυμβάλου ἔπιον, ἐκερνοφόρησα, ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυον</foreign>. All this undoubtedly points to the Phrygian worship of Sabazius, which was introduced by the Orphics into the Eleusinian mysteries. On the afternoon of the 23d was held that portion of the feast which was called <foreign lang="greek">πλημοχόαι</foreign> (Athen. x. p. 496) or <foreign lang="greek">πλημοχόη</foreign> ( <bibl n="Poll.  10. 74" default="NO">Poll.x. 74</bibl>), a sacrifice to the dead. The <foreign lang="greek">πλημοχόη</foreign> was a broad-bottomed earthen jar, and two such were used in the ceremony, one filled with wine and the other with water, the contents of the one thrown to the east and of the other to the west, while mystic words (<foreign lang="greek">ὕε κύε</foreign>) were spoken. This sacrifice formed a fitting conclusion to the mysteries in the special sense, the <foreign lang="greek">μυστηριώτιδες ἡμέραι</foreign>. It ended with a <foreign lang="greek">χαίρετε</foreign> to the dead, which conclusion was called <foreign lang="greek">προχαιρητήρια</foreign> (Harpocr. 161, 9).</p>
 <p>The next morning, the 24th, occurred perhaps the <foreign lang="greek">βαλλητύς</foreign>, also called <foreign lang="greek">τύπται</foreign>, a sort of sham fight, enjoined, it seems, in the Homeric hymn (267 foll.). There was a similar contest, called <foreign lang="greek">λιθοβολία</foreign>, at the festival of Damia and Auxesia at Troezen (cf. Pausan. ii. 32, 2). On this same morning and afternoon were the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες σταδιακοί</foreign>. They were called Eleusinia or Demetria, and the prize was some barley grown on the Rarian Plain (Schol. on <title>Ol.</title> ix. 150, 166). There is no reason to suppose that these games were not annual (see Hermann, <title>Gottesd. Alterth.</title> 55, 39). In early times these games probably lasted two days; but in later times, on the 25th, the theatrical representations of the <foreign lang="greek">Διονύσου τεχνῖται</foreign> were held, and we have some inscriptions referring to the sacrifices offered by this guild. As time went on, the 26th and 27th appear to have been devoted to such theatrical exhibitions (Rangabé, 813, 6), held perhaps for the purpose of keeping the visitors in the country. The people do not appear to have returned to Athens in a regular procession, though Lenormant thinks they did, and that the <foreign lang="greek">γεφυρισμός</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πλημοχόη</foreign> were incidents in that return journey. The mystery truce lasted till the middle of Pyanepsion (<title>C. I. G.</title> 71).
 </p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Priests and Priestesses</hi>. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The most important priest was the <title>Hierophant</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱεροφάντης</foreign>). In lists of the Eleusinian priests he is put first (<title>C. I. G.</title> 184, 190). He was nominated for life (Pausan. ii. 14, 1) from the Eleusinian family of the Eumolpidae, and was generally an elderly man and bound to a life of strict chastity. There was only one Hierophant at a time, and his name was never mentioned (Lucian, <title>Lexiph.</title> 10), though in late inscriptions we find the Roman gentile name but not the praenomen or the cognomen given (<title>C. I. G.</title> 187). His principal duty was, clothed in an Oriental style, with a long robe and a turban (<foreign lang="greek">στρόφιον</foreign>), as his name indicates, to show and explain the sacred symbols and figures—perhaps in a kind of chant or recitative, as he was required to have a good voice (cf. <title>Alcib.</title> 22; Epictet. iii. 21. 16). (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The <title>Daduchus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>) or torch-bearer was inferior to the Hierophant, and of the same rank with the Keryx (<title>C. I. G.</title> 185, compared with 188). Originally he was descended from the Eleusinian Triptolemus ( <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Hell.</title>vi. 3</bibl><bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. Hell., 6</bibl>); but about B.C. 380 this family 
<pb n="582" /><cb />
 died out, and the Lycomidae, the family to which Themistocles belonged, which celebrated a local worship of Demeter at Phlyae full of Orphic doctrines and ceremonies, succeeded to the daduchia (see Boeckh on <title>C. I. G.</title> i. p. 441 f.). It is uncertain whether the name of the Daduchus was sacred. His head-dress was Oriental, as we may infer from a Persian soldier mistaking a Daduchus for a king ( <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Arist.</title>5</bibl>). His main duty was to hold the torch at the sacrifices, as his name indicates; but he shared with the Hierophant several functions, reciting portions of the ritual, taking part in certain purifications in the <foreign lang="greek">πρόρρησις</foreign>, and even in the exhibition of the mysteries ( Suid. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδουχεῖ</foreign>). For these two priests, the Hierophant and the Daduchus, who had to be men of tried sanctity, there was a regular consecration on their entering office. It was the <foreign lang="greek">τέλος τῆς ἐποπτείας</foreign>, and was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάδεσις καὶ στεμμάτων ἐπίθεσις</foreign>, because the sign of it consisted in placing on the head of the new priest the diadem of purple and the wreath of myrtle which they wore permanently. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <title>Keryx</title> or <title>Hierokeryx</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Κῆρυξ, Ἱεροκῆρυξ</foreign>). According to Eleusinian tradition, the Kerykes traced their origin back to Keryx, a younger son of Eumolpus; but they themselves considered their ancestors to be Hermes and one of the daughters of Cecrops—Aglauros according to Pausanias (i. 38, 3), Pandrosos according to Pollux (viii. 103). His duties were chiefly to proclaim silence at the sacrifices ( <bibl n="Poll.  4. 91" default="NO">Poll.iv. 91</bibl>). (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The <title>Epibomios</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐπὶ βωμῷ</foreign>). In early times he was certainly a priest (<title>C. I. G.</title> 71 a, 39); he is generally mentioned in connection with the other three priests, but not always. No family laid especial claim to this priesthood. His name, as well as that of the Keryx, was probably not sacred. The four Eleusinian priests were among those who were maintained in the Prytaneum—were <foreign lang="greek">ἀείσιτοι</foreign>, as they were called (<title>C. I. G.</title> 183 foll.). (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) The <title>Hierophantis</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱερόφαντις</foreign>). There was originally only one at a time; she belonged to Demeter (<title>C. I. G.</title> 434, 2), and her name was sacred; but a new one was added when Hadrian's wife Sabina was deified as the younger Demeter <bibl default="NO">(ib. 435, 1073)</bibl>. Perhaps at this time or afterwards the priestesses came to be multiplied. (See the Schol. on <bibl n="Soph. OC 683" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Col.</title> 683</bibl>). They lived a life of perfect chastity during their tenure of office, though they might have been married previously. It is uncertain to what family the original Hierophantis of Demeter belonged; that of the younger belonged to a branch of the Lycomidae. The duties of the Hierophantis corresponded to those of the Hierophant. Pollux (i. 14) appears to call these priestesses <foreign lang="greek">προφάντιδες</foreign>, and perhaps they were also called <foreign lang="greek">μέλισσαι</foreign> (Hesych. s. v.). <title>(f) Female torch-bearer</title>, <foreign lang="greek">Δᾳδουχήσασα</foreign> (<bibl default="NO"><title>C. I. G.</title> 1535</bibl>). <title>(g) Priestess</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱέρεια</foreign>). She was not hieronymous, but eponymous. These priestesses belonged to the family of the Phillidae. <cb /> Their duties corresponded in all probability with those of the Epibomius. (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) The <title>Spondophori</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σπονδοφόροι</foreign>) were sent out to the adjoining country a month before the ceremony to announce the truce for the mysteries ( <title>Fals. Leg.</title> 133). They belonged to the families of the Eudanemi and Kerykes. <title>(i) Minor offices:</title> (1) <foreign lang="greek">φαιδρύντης τοῖν θεοῖν</foreign> (Inscr. in Mommsen, p. 227), perhaps belonging to the Eleusinium of the city.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">ὑδρανός</foreign>, whom Hesychius describes as <foreign lang="greek">ἁγνίστης τῶν Ἐλευσινίων</foreign>. He probably superintended the <foreign lang="greek">ἅλαδε μύσται</foreign>.</p>
 <p>(3) <foreign lang="greek">ἰακχαγωγός</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κουροτρόφος</foreign>, female nurses attending on the child Iacchus ( <bibl n="Poll.  1. 35" default="NO">Poll.i. 35</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(4) Perhaps the same may be said of the <foreign lang="greek">δαειρῖτις</foreign>, but it is very uncertain. It is known that Persephoné was originally called Daeira in the Eleusinian worship.</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">ἱεραύλης</foreign> (ib. 184, c. 18) was probably the head of the <foreign lang="greek">ὑμνῳδοί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑμνητρίδες</foreign> ( <bibl n="Poll.  1. 35" default="NO">Poll.i. 35</bibl>), a sort of choir.</p>
 <p>(6) Who the <foreign lang="greek">παναγεῖς</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">πυρφόροι</foreign> were, beyond what can be inferred from their names, cannot be determined. Lenormant says the <foreign lang="greek">παναγεῖς</foreign> were intermediate between the ministers and the initiates. Though not strictly a priest, yet as exercising an important function in the mysteries, (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) the <seg lang="la">mystagogi</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μυσταγωγοί</foreign>) may be mentioned here. They had to be men who had passed through all the grades of initiation. They were probably under the cognizance of the State, in a manner licensed. Prior to presenting himself for initiation, each votary had to place himself under the guidance of one of these mystagogues, and get instruction from him as to the various purifications and ceremonies he was to perform. It was only by the carelessness of mystagogues that unworthy applicants ever got admission to the mysteries. After due examination, if the mystagogue was satisfied, he presented the applicant or returned his name to the Archon Basileus or his assistants. This was called <foreign lang="greek">σύστασις</foreign>. If a mystagogue could not say what purificatory sacrifices were required for a special candidate, recourse was had to (<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) an <title>Exegetes</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐξηγήτης</foreign>), who appears to have been elected by the people from the Eumolpidae or Kerykes, and whose business it was to decide such difficult cases and generally to give <seg lang="la">responsa</seg> on eleusinian ecclesiastical law. There were many books of the mysteries (cf. Lenormant, <title>Contemp. Rev.</title> xxxvii. 871) which were intended to have been strictly kept from the uninitiated, and which appear to have contained not only what ritual was to be performed in various cases, but also, perhaps, the allegorical and symbolical interpretations of some of the myths. Cf. Galen, viii. 181, ed. Kuhn; Lobeck, <title>Aglaoph.</title> 194.</p>
 <p>The priests of the mysteries, especially the Eumolpidae, appear to have had a special ecclesiastical court (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερὰ γερουσία</foreign>) for trying offences of impiety, in connection with the festival, which court they conducted according to unwritten laws of immemorial antiquity ( <title>in Andoc.</title> 10). To prosecute before this court was called <foreign lang="greek">δικάζεσθαι πρὸς Εὐμολπίδας</foreign>. Their punishments, according to Caillemer (D. and S. , s. v. <title>Asebeia</title>), were strictly religious—exclusion from the mysteries, deprivation of title of initiate, and such like. The curse and excommunication were most solemn—priests and priestesses, turning to the west, uttered the words of imprecation and shook their garments ([Lys. ] <title>in Andoc.</title> 51). It may be that this court was the only tribunal for cases of what we may call heterodoxy, impiety consisting in the performance 
<pb n="583" /><cb />
 of rites contrary to the traditional one and to that held by the priests; while other kinds of procedure, superadded to the religious investigation and condemnation, were adopted in accordance with ordinary criminal law in cases of impiety, which consisted of disorder and vulgar profanity. These charges were brought before the Senate of Five Hundred sitting in the Eleusinium of the city on the day after the mysteries ( <title>De Myst.</title> 111). The penalty was death ( <bibl n="Thuc.  6. 61" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.vi. 61</bibl> fin.) or banishment ( <bibl n="Andoc.  15" default="NO">Andoc.15</bibl>), with confiscation of goods (<title>C. I. A.</title> i. 277), for profanation of the mysteries. The accuser, if he did not get the fifth part of the votes, suffered a kind of <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign> ( <bibl n="Andoc.  33" default="NO">Andoc.33</bibl>) —i. e. was deprived of the right to enter the temples and fined the usual 1000 drachmas. Many shrank from themselves bringing the accusation, and used to inform the Archon Basileus of the profanation they had observed, and if he thought it serious he made the accusation officially.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Civil Functionaries connected with the Festival</hi>. The chief civil superintendence of the festival was intrusted to the Archon Basileus, who was assisted by four <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμεληταί</foreign>, elected by the people, two from the people generally and one each from the families of the Eumolpidae and Kerykes (Aristot. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Harpocr. p. 118). The Archon generally appears to have appointed an assistant (<foreign lang="greek">πάρεδρος</foreign>). The duties of the Archon and his assistant were to sacrifice and pray for the prosperity of the people, both at Athens and Eleusis, and to have general police supervision over the whole solemnity ( <title>c. Andoc.</title> 4). The <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιμεληταί</foreign> had also such duties as looking after the sacrifices, testing the offerings of the votaries, classifying and marshalling the different grades of initiates, managing certain moneys, etc., as may be inferred from the similar duties attaching to the officials of this name at Andania. As to the finances of the festival generally, according to <title>C. I. G.</title> 71 a, 29, three <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροποιοί</foreign> had the administration of them.
 </p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Initiates</hi>. Originally only Athenians were admitted; legend said that Heracles and the Dioscuri ( <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Thes.</title>33</bibl>) had to be adopted prior to initiation; but later all Greek-speaking people who were not murderers were admissible to be initiated (Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> 42). Barbarians were excluded (Lucian, <bibl n="Luc. Scyth. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Scyth.</title>8</bibl>); but it was not at all necessary to be an Athenian citizen. Women ( <title>Eleus.</title> vol. i. p. 257, Jebb), and even perhaps slaves (Theophilus, <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 1." default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>i.</bibl>, vol. ii. p. 473, Kock), were admissible. Children were admitted to the first grade only; but among the children brought to Eleusis one was picked out for special initiation, and “to appease the divinity by a more exact performance” of the ceremonies required ( <bibl n="Porph. Abst. 4. 5" default="NO">Porphyr. <title>Abst.</title>iv. 5</bibl>). The boy or girl had to be an Athenian of high birth (Bekk. <title>Anecd.</title> 204), perhaps of the special family of the Lycomidae, Eumolpidae, or the like; and was probably initiated standing on the steps of the altar, while the rest stood afar off. The parents of the child had to make extensive offerings and pay a large fee. Originally admission was free for all initiates; but by virtue of a law passed by the orator Aristogiton, each initiate paid a fee to the public treasury (Lenormant, <title>Contemp. Review</title>, xxxviii. p. 123).</p>
 <p>The ordinary proceeding was for the initiate to receive his first introduction as a child and afterwards the higher grades as a man. The whole cycle of the mysteries was a <seg lang="la">trieteris</seg>, and could be <cb /> gone through in two years; even the Homeric hymn extends the whole legend beyond a year; and when the Orphic theology blended IacchusZagreus into the story, the regular course of two years came to be adopted. There is a high probability that the first-year votaries at Eleusis viewed a drama representing the usual story of Demeter and Coré, while the second-year votaries were shown the whole legend of Zagreus; and as to the whole course of the actual mysteries, there is a possibility that the following arrangement was that adopted, though it must be remembered that it is little more than conjecture and given for what it is worth:</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) First Spring at Agrae—the votaries mourn for Coré ravished by Hades.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) First Autumn at Eleusis—mourning with Demeter for the loss of her daughter, and exhibition of the ordinary legend.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Second Spring at Agrae—the murder of Zagreus and his heart being given to Coré (who here seems to take the place of Semelé), and conception of Iacchus.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Second Autumn at Eleusis—rebirth of Iacchus, who is carried in procession to Demeter at Eleusis, and there the votaries sympathize in the joy of the earth-goddess, who once more has her child and grandchild about her.</p>
 <p>That there were different grades of initiates hardly needs proof: the <foreign lang="greek">μύσται</foreign> were those who had received any degree of initiation, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόπται</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἔφοροι</foreign> the second-year votaries. Suidas (s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόπται</foreign>) says so explicitly. (Cf. Harpocr. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἐπωπτευκότων</foreign>, and  <bibl n="Plut. Demetr. 26." default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Demetr.</title>26.</bibl>) There were mystic ceremonies for both these classes of initiates, one on each of the two days, 22d and 23d. While any one introduced by a mystagogue could get admission to the ceremonies of the first year, the <foreign lang="greek">μύησις</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόπτεια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐποψία</foreign> could only be seen by those who got a ticket from the <foreign lang="greek">δᾳδοῦχος</foreign>. A ticket of that kind has been discovered marked <foreign lang="greek">ΔΑΔ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ΕΠΟΨ</foreign>, with the symbols of an ear of corn and a poppy. What those ceremonies were is the most important and interesting point in our subject, but the seal of silence which was laid on the votaries has not been broken. This secrecy was most strenuously enjoined and most rigorously enforced, as we have seen. The prosecution of Alcibiades for holding a travesty of the mysteries in his own house and Andocides's speech on the subject are well known. Aeschylus is said to have divulged the mysteries in styling Artemis a daughter of Demeter ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 156" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 156</bibl>; Pausan. viii. 37, 6) and in other matters (Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 3. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nic. Eth.</title>iii. 1</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> Nic. Eth., 17</bibl>), and to have only barely escaped death. Diagoras of Melos ( <bibl n="Diod.  13. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xiii. 6</bibl>) was banished from Athens and a price set on his head for having divulged the mysteries. It was the prevailing belief of antiquity that he who was guilty of divulging the mysteries was sure to bring down divine vengeance on himself and those associated with him ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>iii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 26</bibl>).

 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Ceremonies in the Temple</hi>. They were performed in the temple of the two goddesses at Eleusis, a building reckoned one of the greatest masterpieces of the Periclean Age. Ictinus superintended the whole. Coroebus built the lower story, with four rows of columns which divided the interior space. On his death Metagenes took up the work and added an upper story, and Xenocles built a cupola roof with an opening (<foreign lang="greek">ὄπαιον</foreign>) 
<pb n="584" /><cb />
 in the middle for the light ( <title>Pericl.</title> 13; Vitruv. vii. Pref. 16, 17). The dimensions of the whole building were 223 feet by 179, the measurement of the cella being 175 feet by 179. The temple had no pillars in the façade till the architect Philon, in the time of Demetrius of Phalerum, built a pronaos with twelve pillars. The temple stood inside a large enclosure, which was approached by a propylaeum, there being yet another propylaeum leading to the temple. Inside this enclosure Lenormant has fixed the position of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγέλαστος πέτρα</foreign>, where Demeter was said to have rested in her wanderings, as the rock where the great statue of Demeter Achea, now at Cambridge, stood—i. e. on the axis of the first propylaeum close to a well, which he also identifies as Callichorum. (See the <foreign lang="greek">Πρακτικὰ τῆς Ἀρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρίας</foreign> for 1883, and M. Blavette in <title>Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique</title>, viii. [1884], pp. 254 foll.). The temple of Ictinus, though built on the site of an older and smaller one, must be distinguished from the most ancient temple which stood more to the north, occupying a platform which overlooked the well Callichorum and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγέλαστος πέτρα</foreign>, exactly on the spot where the Homeric hymn (273) orders it to be built. The great temple of Ictinus was called by the ancients <foreign lang="greek">μυστικὸς σηκός</foreign> ( <bibl n="Strab.  9. 395" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.ix. 395</bibl>), and the inner portion <foreign lang="greek">τελεστήριον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκτορον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> (cf. Lobeck, <title>Aglaoph.</title> 59).</p>
 <p>The ceremony was doubtless dramatic. “Deo and Coré,” says Clement of Alexandria (<title>Protrept.</title> p. 12), “have become a mystic drama. Eleusis illustrates by the light of the torches of the Daduchus the carrying off of Coré, the wandering journeys and grief of Deo.” The ceremony, then, was dramatic. Aelius Aristides (<title>Eleus.</title> i. 256) asks, “Where else do the recitals of the narratives chant forth greater marvels, or does the ceremonial (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ δρώμενα</foreign>) involve a greater affrightment (<foreign lang="greek">ἔκπληξιν</foreign>), or does the spectacle match more fully what the ear hears?” The drama consisted of <foreign lang="greek">δρώμενα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λεγόμενα</foreign>, the former being much the more important, for the ancient religious worship addressed itself more to the eye than to the ear. There were hymns and chants (Pausan. ix. 27, 2), speeches and exhortations (<foreign lang="greek">ῥήσεις, παραγγέλματα</foreign>), recitals of myths (<foreign lang="greek">μύθων φῆμαι</foreign>), and wailings for the loss of Persephoné (Proclus on <title>Polit.</title> p. 384). There were kinds of dancing or rhythmical movements by those performing the ceremony (Lucian, <title>De Salt.</title> 15), clashing of cymbals ( <bibl n="Vell.  1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Vell.i. 4</bibl><bibl n="Vell.  1" default="NO" valid="yes">Vell., 1</bibl>), sudden changes from light to darkness (Dio Chrys. xii. 387), “toilsome wanderings and dangerous passages through the gloom, but the end is not yet, and then before the end all kinds of terror, shivering and quaking, sweating and amazement, when suddenly a wondrous light flashes forth to the worshipper, and pure regions and meadows receive him: there are chants, voices, and dances, solemn words and holy images; and amongst these the votary now perfected is freed at last and is released, he wanders to and fro with a crown on his head, joining in the worship and in the company of pure and holy men; and he sees the uninitiated and unpurified crowd of the living in the thick <cb /> mire and mist, trampling one another down, and huddled together, abiding ever in evils through fear of death and disbelief in the good things yonder” ( Themist. in <title>Serm.</title> cxx. 26). Lucian (<title>Catapl.</title> 22) represents a man having entered Hades and got into the dark asking his companion if what was represented at Eleusis was not like this. Claudian's description (<title>De Rapt. Proserp.</title> init.) is sufficiently terrible; and amidst that rhetoric Lenormant fancies he can infer that the votaries, waiting anxiously outside the building, saw the glimmer of the lighted interior through the <foreign lang="greek">ὄπαιον</foreign>: then was heard the noise of the preparations for the play, the doors were thrown open, and the Daduchus appeared with torches in his hands, and the statue of Demeter was seen in gorgeous vestments and brilliantly lighted up. It is more probable that the whole performance took place inside the temple. But that figures of the gods were introduced is certain, which flitted noiselessly (<foreign lang="greek">ἀψοφητί</foreign>,  <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 16. 224" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>xvi. 224</bibl>, ed. Dind.) across the stage; but the images were incomplete, not simple but overcharged with strange attributes, they were ever in motion and represented in a dim and murky light. To be more precise, the mystic drama of Demeter and Coré was unfolded to the mystae, the first-year initiates; but the epoptae were shown a representation of what Clement calls “the mysteries of the dragon,” which is the story of Zeus uniting himself with Persephoné (called Brimo: cf. <title>Philosophumena</title>, viii. p. 115, ed. Miller) in the form of a serpent, and the whole tale of Iacchus-Zagreus was probably told (Clem. Alex. <title>Protrept.</title> pp. 13-15; Tatian, <title>Or. ad Graecos</title>, 13 [9 ed. Migne]; and Lenormant, p. 426). There was shown to the epoptae a representation, symbolical probably of creation, in which we hear (Euseb. <title>Praep. Evang.</title> iii. 12) that the Hierophant used to assume the part of the Creator, the Daduchus that of the sun, the altar-priest that of the moon, and the Hierokeryx that of Hermes. Again, “the last, the most solemn, and the most wonderful act of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐποψία</foreign>” was shown—the ear of corn cut in perfect stillness; the blade of corn symbolized, we are told, the great and perfect ray of light issuing from the Inexpressible One, whatever that means, or rather, perhaps, it was the symbol of life, the cutting down being death. 
<pb n="585" /><cb /></p>
 <p>This may lead us to what is to be said in conclusion on the moral and religious import of the mysteries. If we choose to regard them in a cold, un-religious way, we can say that they were a somewhat melodramatic performance, splendid no doubt, full of what Lobeck calls fireworks (<hi rend="italic">pyrotechnia</hi>), but a mere theatrical display. That there were connections between the mysteries and the theatre (the Hierophants are said to have borrowed costume from the dramas of Aeschylus, Athen. i. p. 22, if the reverse is not rather the case) need not surprise us; and that modern archaeologists profess to find in the temple of Eleusis evidences of machinery by which the spectacle was worked (Preller in Pauly, iii. 89; Lenormant, p. 415) is only natural; for there undoubtedly was a spectacle, a religious spectacle. But anything moral or religious may be made ridiculous if one chooses to regard it from the lower plane of the intellect alone, and does not take into account the subjective condition of the moral worker or the religious worshipper. The universal voice of the great names of pagan antiquity, from the Homeric hymn down to the writers of the late Roman Empire, attest to the wonderfully soothing effect the mysteries had on the religious emotions, and what glad hopes they inspired of good fortune in the world to come. <title>Neque solum</title>, says Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> ii. 14, 36), <seg lang="la">cum laetitia vivendi rationem accepimus, sed etiam cum spe meliore moriendi.</seg> For the object aimed at was rather, not that the initiate should be taught anything that would appeal merely to his intellect, but should be moved and have his higher impulses stirred. “The light of the sun is bright for the initiated alone,” sing the chorus of mystae in the <title>Ranae</title> (454). Not but that there were many scenes and symbols of a somewhat coarse nature—phallic rites, <foreign lang="greek">ἱεροὶ γάμοι</foreign>, such as those represented by the Hierophant and Hierophantis, which portrayed perhaps the unions of Zeus and Demeter, Zeus and Persephoné, and which entered into the higher worship, but which are probably grossly exaggerated by the Christian writers, who did not take into consideration their symbolical meaning. The truths, however, which these and other symbolical performances contained were known only to the Hierophant, and explained by him to those whom he thought fit to hear them. Even the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπόπται</foreign> only knew part of the mystic secrets, <foreign lang="greek">γνῶναί τι τῶν ἀπορρήτων</foreign> (Sopatros, <title>Distinct. Quaest.</title> p. 121). The multitude of worshippers took it all on faith, but, as Mahaffy finely remarks, “even the coarsest features were hallowed and ennobled by the spirit of the celebrants, whose reverence blinded their eyes while it lifted up their hearts.”</p>
 <p>The Eleusinian Mysteries lasted for more than five centuries after Greece became a Roman province. As late as the time of the emperor Julian they still enjoyed a considerable portion of their primeval sanctity, and were held in the highest esteem by the Neo-Platonic philosophers. The edict of Valentinian and Valens against secret worships did not extend to the Eleusinia, the prefect of Achaea, Pretextatus, having represented that the life of the Greeks would be barren and comfortless without the mysteries. The Hierophant who initiated Maximus and Eunapius in the fourth century was the last Eumolpid. Subsequently Mithraic worship was blended with the Eleusinian; but the mysteries did not finally <cb /> perish till the destruction of Eleusis by Alaric in his invasion of Greece, A.D. 396.</p>

<head orig="Eleusis">Eleusis</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Eleusin</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐλευσίς, Ἐλευσίν</foreign>). (1) An ancient city of Boeotia, which stood, according to tradition, near Copae and the Lake Copaïs, and was, together with another ancient city, named Athenae, inundated by the waters of that lake. Stephanus of Byzantium reports that when Crates drained the waters which had overspread the plains the city of Athenae became visible (s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθῆναι</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(2) A city of Attica, equidistant from Megara and the Piraeus, and famed for the celebration of the mysteries of Demeter. According to some writers it derived its name from a hero, whom some affirmed to be the son of Hermes but others of Ogyges (Pausan. i. 38). Its origin is certainly of the highest antiquity, as it appears to have already existed in the time of Cecrops, but we are not informed by whom, or at what period, the worship of Demeter was introduced there. Eusebius places the building of the first temple in the reign of Pandion; but, according to other authors, it is more ancient. Celeus is said to have been king of Eleusis when Demeter first arrived there. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>.</p>
 <p>At one period Eleusis was powerful enough to contend with Athens for the sovereignty of Attica. This was in the time of Eumolpus. The controversy was ended by a treaty, wherein it was stipulated that Eleusis should yield to the control of Athens, but that the sacred rites of Demeter should be celebrated at the former city. Demeter and Triptolemus were both worshipped here with peculiar solemnity, and here also was shown the Rarius Campus, where Demeter was said to have first sown corn (Pausan. i. 38). The temple of Eleusis was burned by the Persian army in the in vasion of Attica ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 65" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 65</bibl>), but was rebuilt, under the administration of Pericles, by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon ( <title>Pericles</title>). This magnificent structure was entirely destroyed by Alaric in the year A.D. 396. Eleusis, though so considerable and important a place, was classed among the Attic demes and belonged to the tribe Hippothoöntis. The colossal statue of the Eleusinian Demeter, the work of Phidias, after having 
<pb n="586" /><cb />
 suffered many mutilations, was taken to England by Dr. Clarke and Mr. Cripps in 1801, and now stands in the vestibule of the University Library at Cambridge. The temple itself was cleared by Sir William Gell, and important excavations have been made by the Greek Archaeological Society since 1887.

<div2 id="crosseleutheria" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eleutheria">Eleutheria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐλευθέρια</foreign>). The feast of liberty; a festival which the Greeks, after the battle of Plataea (B.C. 479), instituted in honour of Zeus Eleutherius (the deliverer). It was intended not merely to be a token of their gratitude to the god, but also as a bond of union among themselves; for, in an assembly of all the Greeks, Aristides carried a decree that delegates from all the Greek States should assemble every year at Plataea for the celebration of the Eleutheria. The town itself was at the same time declared sacred and inviolable, as long as its citizens offered the annual sacrifices which were then instituted on behalf of Greece. Every fifth year these solemnities were celebrated with contests (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγὼν τῶν Ἐλευθερίων</foreign>) in which the victors were rewarded with chaplets. The annual solemnity at Plataea, which continued to be observed down to the time of Plutarch ( <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 19" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Arist.</title>19</bibl> and 21), was as follows: On the sixteenth of the month of Maemacterion, a procession, led by a trumpeter, who blew the signal for battle, marched at daybreak through the middle of the town. It was followed by wagons loaded with myrtle-boughs and chaplets, by a black bull, and by free youths who carried the vessels containing the libations for the dead. No slave was permitted to minister on this occasion. At the end of this procession followed the archon of Plataea, who was not allowed at any other time during his office to touch a weapon or to wear any other but white garments, now wearing a purple tunic and with a sword in his hand, and also bearing an urn, kept for this solemnity in the public archives (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματοφυλάκιον</foreign>). When the procession came to the place where the Greeks who had fallen at Plataea were buried, the archon first washed and anointed the tombstones, and then led the bull to a pyre and sacrificed it, praying to Zeus and Hermes Chthonius, and inviting the brave men who had fallen in the defence of their country to take part in the banquet prepared for them. See Thuc. iii. 58.</p>
 <p>Eleutheria was also the name of a festival celebrated in Samos, in honour of Eros.

 <p> A collection of ancient sculptures brought from Greece to England by the Earl of Elgin, in 1812, while he was British ambassador to the Porte. On the strength of a firman from the Sultan authorizing Lord Elgin to examine, measure, and remove certain stones and inscriptions from the Athenian acropolis, his agents took possession of these marbles, which are said to have cost the ambassador nearly ˙75,000. In 1816, they were acquired by the British Museum for ˙35,000, and are now the property of the British nation, though a bitter controversy has from that time to this been waged sporadically, both as to the artistic value of the statues and as to the propriety of their removal from Greece. The chief marbles formed a part of the Parthenon, and were probably designed by Phidias and executed under his direction. They are mainly statues from the pediments and metopes, together with a large portion of the frieze of the <seg lang="la">cella.</seg> In addition, there are also figures from the Erechtheum and from the Temple of Niké Apteros.

<head orig="Elis">Elis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἦλις</foreign>; Doric, <foreign lang="greek">Ἆλις</foreign>). A district of the Peloponnesus, lying west of Arcadia. At the period of the Peloponnesian War the name of Elis was applied to the whole of that northwestern portion of the peninsula situated between the rivers Larissus and Neda which served to separate it from Achaea and Messenia. But in earlier times this tract of country was divided into several districts or principalities, each occupied by a separate clan or people, of whom the Caucones were probably the most ancient, so that Strabo affirms that, according to some authors, the whole of Elis once bore the name of Cauconia. Before the siege of Troy, the Epei, an Elean tribe, are said to have been greatly reduced by their wars with Heracles, who conquered Augeas their king, and the Pylians commanded by Nestor. They subsequently, however, acquired a great accession of strength by the influx of a large colony from Aetolia, under the conduct of Oxylus, and their numbers were further increased by a considerable detachment of the Dorians and Heraclidae. Iphitus, descended from Oxylus, and a contemporary of Lycurgus, re-established the Olympic Games, which, though instituted, as it was said, by Heracles, had been interrupted for several years (Pausan. v. 4). The Pisatae, having remained masters of Olympia from the first celebration of the festival, long disputed its possession with the Eleans, but they were finally conquered, when the temple and the presidency of the games fell into the hands of their rivals. The preponderance obtained by the latter is chiefly attributable to the assistance they derived from Sparta, in return for the aid afforded to that State in the Messenian War. From this period we may date the ascendency of Elis over all the other surrounding districts hitherto independent. It now comprised not only the country of the Epei and Caucones, which might be termed Elis Proper, but the territories of Pisa and Olympia, forming the ancient kingdom of Pelops, and the whole of Triphylia.</p>
 <p>The troops of Elis were present in all the engagements fought against the Persians, and in the Peloponnesian War zealously adhered to the Spartan confederacy, until the conclusion of the treaty after the battle of Amphipolis, when an <figure id="fig.00587">
<head orig="Coins of Elis with Effigies of Zeus.">Coins of Elis with Effigies of Zeus.</head>
</figure> <cb /> open rupture took place between this people and the Lacedaemonians, in consequence of protection and countenance afforded by the latter to the inhabitants of Lepraeum, who had revolted from them ( <bibl n="Thuc.  5. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.v. 31</bibl>). Such was the resentment of the Eleans on this occasion that they imposed a heavy fine on the Lacedaemonians, and prohibited their taking part in the Olympic Games. They also made war upon Sparta, in conjunction with the Mantineans, Argives, and Athenians; and it was not till after the unsuccessful battle of Mantinea that this confederacy was dissolved ( <bibl n="Thuc.  5. 81" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.v. 81</bibl>). The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, avenged those injuries by frequent incursions into the territory of Elis, the fertility of which presented an alluring prospect of booty to an invading army. They were beaten, however, at Olympia under the command of Agis (Pausan. v. 4); and again repulsed before the city of Elis, whither they had advanced under Pausanias ( <bibl n="Diod.  14. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xiv. 17</bibl>). At length the Eleans, wearied with the continual incursions to which their country was exposed, since it furnished entire subsistence to the army of the enemy, gladly sued for peace. Not long after, however, we find them again in arms, together with the Boeotians and Argives, against Sparta ( <title>Hist. Gr.</title> vii. 2). At the battle of Mantinea they once more fought under the Spartan banners, jealousy of the rising ascendency obtained by the Thebans having led them to abandon their interests (id. vii. 5, 1). Pausanias writes that when Philip acquired the dominion of Greece the Eleans, who had suffered much from civil dissensions, joined the Macedonian alliance, but refused to fight against the Athenians and Thebans at Chaeronea, and on the death of Alexander they united their arms with those of the other confederates, who carried on the war of Lamia against Antipater and the other commanders of the Macedonian forces. Some years after, Aristotimus, son of Damaretus, through the assistance of Antigonus Gonatas, usurped the sovereignty of Elis; but a conspiracy having been formed against him he was slain at the altar of Zeus Soter, whither he had fled for refuge (Pausan. v. 4, 5). During the Social War the Eleans were the firmest allies of the Aetolians in the Peloponnesus; and though they were on more than one occasion basely deserted by that people, and sustained heavy losses in the field as well as from 
<pb n="588" /><cb />
 the devastation of their territory and the capture of their towns, they could not be induced to desert their cause and join the Achaean League. These events, described by Polybius, are the last in which the Eleans are mentioned as an independent people; for, though they do not appear to have taken any part in the Achaean War, they were included with the rest of the Peloponnesus in the general decree by which the whole of Greece was annexed to the Roman Empire. Elis was by far the most fertile and populous district of the Peloponnesus, and its inhabitants are described as fond of agriculture and rural pursuits (Poly b. iv. 73).</p>
 <p>Elis was divided into three districts—Elis Proper, or “Hollow Elis” (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Κοίλη Ἦλις</foreign>), Pisatis, and Triphylia. The first of these occupied the northern section of the country and has already been alluded to; the second, or Pisatis, was that part of the Elean territory through which flowed the Alpheus after its junction with the Erymanthus. It derived its name from the city of Pisa; the third, or Triphylia, formed the southern division.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The capital of Elis, situated on the Peneus, at the distance of 120 stadia from the sea. It was, like many other towns of Greece, at first composed of several detached villages, which, being united after the Persian War, formed one considerable city. It always, however, remained without walls, as it was deemed sacred and under the immediate protection of the god whose festival was there solemnized. Hence, in early times, according to Ephorus, those troops which were obliged to traverse this country delivered up their arms on entering it and received them again upon quitting the frontier. But this primitive state of things was not of long duration, for we subsequently find the Elean territory as little respected as any other Grecian State by the powers at war with that republic. Still the peace and tranquillity thus enjoyed for a time by the Eleans, together with the vast concourse of persons attracted by the Olympic Games, greatly contributed to the prosperity and opulence of their city.

The abode of the blessed in another world, where they enjoyed all manner of the purest pleasures. In the Homeric mythology the Elysian Fields lay on the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Oceanus, and to them the mortal relatives of the king of the gods were transported, without tasting

 of death, to enjoy an immortality of bliss ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 563" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 563</bibl> foll.). In the time of Hesiod, the Elysian Plains had become the Isles of the Blessed (<foreign lang="greek">μακάρων νῆσοι</foreign>) in the Western Ocean (<title>Op. et D.</title> 171). Pindar, who has left a glowing description of Elysium, appears to reduce the number of these happy islands to one (<title>Ol.</title> ii. 129). At a later day a change of religious ideas ensued, brought about by the increase of geographical knowledge, and Elysium was moved down to the lower world as the place of reward for the good. The Vergilian conception respecting Elysium made it a region blessed with perpetual spring, clothed with continual verdure, beautiful with flowers, shaded by pleasant groves, and refreshed by neverfailing fountains. Here the righteous lived in perfect felicity, communing with each other, bathed in a flood of light proceeding from their own sun, and with the sky at eve lighted up by their own constellations: <seg lang="la">solemque suum, sua sidera norunt</seg> ( <bibl n="Verg.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμβλημα</foreign>), <hi rend="bold">Emblemăta.</hi> (1) Emblemata were metal ornaments, such as masks, busts, medallions, figures of men and animals, wrought in relief and artificially attached by soldering or riveting to the interior or exterior of metal bowls, vases, cups, etc. ( <title>in Verr.</title> iv. 22). Such ornaments were sometimes made of gold and silver, and had an artistic and pecuniary value even when detached from the objects to which they belonged. Thus, the plunderer Verres took especial care to wrench off emblemata from vases and cups. Emblemata must be distinguished from metal ornaments in relief (such as those produced in repoussé), which formed an integral part of the vase itself: the essence of the emblema was that it could be detached, if necessary, from the vase which it ornamented. Many of the metal masks, figures, dishes, etc., in modern museums are doubtless emblemata which have been broken off from vases.</p>

<head orig="Emissarium">Emissarium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπόνομος</foreign>). The name given to an artificial channel by which an outlet is formed to carry off any stagnant body of water ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> xvi. 18). In Greece, in the early times of the Minyae of Orchomenus, we find the natural channels (<hi rend="italic">katavóthra</hi>, as they are now called) which carry off the waters of the Boeotian Cephissus through Lake Copais to the sea supplemented by two artificial emissaria or tunnels. The longer of the two, connecting the lake with the lower course of the Cephissus, is nearly four miles in length, according to Forchhammer, and with about twenty perpendicular shafts sunk into it, some of which are from 100 to 150 feet in depth. The second tunnel, much shorter, unites the lakes Copa ïs and Hylica, running under the Acraephian Plain at no great depth, and is likewise provided with shafts. Both tunnels and shafts are now choked up, but can still be traced. The natural <hi rend="italic">katavóthra</hi> being insufficient to carry off the waters of the Cephissus, much of what was once fertile alluvial land is now turned to a swamp and awaits the efforts of modern enterprise. An abortive attempt to clear out these tunnels was made by an engineer named Crates under the orders of Alexander the Great ( <bibl n="Strab.  9." default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.ix.</bibl> p. 407), and it was announced in 1888 that the reclamation of Lake Copaïs was again to be attempted.</p>
 <p>Herodotus describes with marked interest the tunnel of Eupalinus at Samos, by which a supply of fresh water was introduced into the city, and gives it the first place among the “three greatest works of the Greeks,” the others being the mole in the harbour of Samos and the Heraeum or temple of Heré (iii. 60). These works unquestionably date from the tyranny of Polycrates, the most flourishing period of Samos, which ended about B.C. 522.</p>
 <p>In Italy the Etruscans were the first great masters in the art of tunnelling, and the Romans learned it from them. The Cloaca Maxima itself is quite as much an emissary as a sewer, draining the Forum and the Velabrum, which previously were swamps. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>.) But the greatest Roman emissarium is that of Lake Fucinus. Iulius Caesar is said to have first conceived the idea of this stupendous undertaking ( <title>Iul.</title> 44), which was carried into effect by the emperor Claudius ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 12. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xii. 57</bibl>). The length of the emissary, which lies nearly in a direct line from the lake to the river Liris (Garigliano), is 15,600 English feet, or three miles all but 80 yards. The number of workmen employed was 30,000, and the time occupied in the work eleven years ( <title>Claud.</title> 20). For more than a mile the tunnel is carried under a mountain, of which the highest part is 1000 feet above the level of the lake, and through a stratum of rocky formation so hard that every inch required to be worked by the chisel. The remaining portion runs through a softer soil, not much below the level of the earth, and is vaulted with brick. Perpendicular shafts (<seg lang="la">putei</seg>) are sunk at various distances into the tunnel, and a number of lateral openings (<seg lang="la">cuniculi</seg>), some of which separate themselves into two branches, one above the other, are likewise directed into it, the lowest at an elevation of five feet from the bottom. Through these the materials excavated were carried out. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00590">
<head orig="Emissarium.">Emissarium.</head>
</figure> The immediate mouth of the tunnel was at some distance from the margin of the lake. The upper end of the tunnel itself consists of a splendid archway of the Doric order, nineteen feet high and nine wide, formed out of large blocks of stone, resembling in construction the works of the Claudian aqueduct. The mouth through which the waters discharged themselves into the Liris was more simple and is represented in the preceding illustration.</p>

<head orig="Empedŏcles">Empedocles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐμπεδοκλῆς</foreign>). A native of Agrigentum in Sicily, who flourished about B.C. 450. He was distinguished not only as a philosopher, but also for his knowledge of natural history and medicine, and as a poet and statesman. After the death of his father Meto, who was a wealthy citizen of Agrigentum, he acquired great weight among his fellow-citizens by espousing the popular party and favouring democratic measures. 
<pb n="591" /><cb /></p>
 <p>His consequence in the State became at length so great that he ventured to assume several of the distinctions of royalty, particularly a purple robe, a golden girdle, a Delphic crown, and a train of attendants. The skill which he possessed in medicine and natural philosophy enabled him to perform many wonders, which he passed upon the superstitious and credulous multitude for miracles. He pretended to drive away noxious winds from his country and thereby put a stop to epidemic diseases. He is said to have checked, by the power of music, the madness of a young man who was threatening his enemy with instant death; to have restored a woman to life who had lain breathless thirty days; and to have done many other things, equally astonishing, after the manner of Pythagoras. On account of all this he was an object of universal admiration. Besides medical skill Empedocles possessed poetical talents. The fragments of his verses are scattered throughout the ancient writers; and Fabricius is of opinion that he was the real author of those ancient fragments which bear the name of the “Golden Verses of Pythagoras,” and may be found printed at the end of Göttling's edition of Hesiod. His principal works were a didactic poem on Nature (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φύσεως</foreign>), and another entitled <foreign lang="greek">Καθαρμοί</foreign>, which seems to have recommended virtuous conduct as a means of averting disease. Gorgias of Leontini, the well-known orator, known as “the Nihilist,” was his pupil, whence it may seem reasonable to infer that Empedocles was no inconsiderable master of the art of eloquence. According to the common account he threw himself into the burning crater of Aetna, in order that the manner of his death might not be known, and that he might afterwards pass for a god; but the secret was discovered by means of one of his brazen sandals, which was thrown out from the mountain in a subsequent eruption of the volcano. This story is rejected, however, as fictitious by Strabo and other writers. According to Aristotle he died at sixty years of age.</p>
 <p>His views in philosophy are variously given. By some he is called a Pythagorean, in consequence of a resemblance of doctrine in a few unessential points. But the principles of his theory evidently show that he belongs to the Eleatic School. Empedocles taught that originally All was one, a God eternal and at rest; a sphere and a mixture (<foreign lang="greek">σφαῖρος, μίγμα</foreign>), without a vacuum, in which the elements of things were held together in undistinguishable confusion by love (<foreign lang="greek">φιλία</foreign>), the primal force which unites the like to like. In a portion of this whole, however, or, as he expresses it, in the members of the Deity, strife (<foreign lang="greek">νεῖκος</foreign>), the force which binds like to unlike, prevailed, and gave the elements a tendency to separate themselves, whereby the first became perceptible as such, although the separation was not so complete but that each contained portions of the others. Hence arose the multiplicity of things. By the vivifying counteraction of love, organic life was produced, not, however, so perfect and so full of design as it now appears; but, at first, single limbs, then irregular combinations, till ultimately they received their present adjustments and perfection. But, as the forces of love and hate are constantly acting upon each other for generation or destruction, the present condition of things cannot persist forever, and the world <cb /> which, properly, is not the All, but only the ordered part of it, will again be reduced to a chaotic unity, out of which a new system will be formed, and so on forever. There is no real destruction of anything, but only a change of combinations.</p>
 <p>Of the elements (which he seems to have been the first to describe as four distinct species of matter), fire, as the rarest and most powerful, he held to be the chief, and, consequently, the soul of all sentient and intellectual beings which issue from the central fire, or soul of the world. The soul migrates through animal and vegetable bodies in atonement for some guilt committed in its unembodied state when it is a daemon, of which he supposed that an infinite number existed. The seat of a daemon, when in a human body, is the blood. Closely connected with this view of the objects of knowledge was his theory of human knowledge. In the impure separation of the elements it is only the predominant one that the senses can apprehend; and, consequently, though man can know all the elements of the whole singly, he is unable to see them in their perfect unity, wherein consists their truth. Empedocles therefore rejects the testimony of the senses, and maintains that pure intellect alone can arrive at a knowledge of the truth. This is the attribute of the Deity, for man cannot overlook the work of love in all its extent; and the true unity is open only to itself. Hence he was led to distinguish between the world as presented to our senses (<foreign lang="greek">κόσμος αἰσθητός</foreign>) and its type, the intellectual world (<foreign lang="greek">κόσμος νοητός</foreign>). Lucretius, who praises Empedocles highly even while criticising his philosophy, appears to have taken him as a model. (Cf. <bibl n="Lucr. 1.716" default="NO" valid="yes">Lucret. i. 716</bibl> foll.) The fragments of Empedocles have been published, with a commentary, by Sturz <bibl default="NO">(1805)</bibl>; by Peyron <bibl default="NO">(1810)</bibl>; Karsten <bibl default="NO">(1838)</bibl>; Stein <bibl default="NO">(1852)</bibl>; and Bergk <bibl default="NO">(2d ed.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐμφύτευσις</foreign>, lit. “an implanting”). A perpetual and “real” right in agricultural land which belongs to another person, entitling the <seg lang="la">emphyteuta</seg> to cultivate it practically as though it were his own, on condition of paying a fixed rent (<seg lang="la">pensio, canon</seg>) to the <seg lang="la">dominus</seg>, or owner, somewhat after the nature of the English “feefarm” rent (“feodifirma,” <title>Magna Carta</title>, c. 37).</p>
 <p>The origin of emphyteusis is traceable to the <seg lang="la">agri vectigales</seg>, first distinctly mentioned about the time of Hadrian—large tracts of grazing land in

 <p> In Roman law the contract of buying and selling consists in the buyer agreeing to give a certain sum of money to the seller, and the seller agreeing to give to the buyer some certain thing for his money. After the agreement is made the buyer is bound to pay his money, even if the thing which is the object of purchase should be accidentally destroyed before it is delivered; and the seller must deliver the thing with all its intermediate increase. The seller must also guarantee a good title to the purchase (see <ref type="cross" target="crossevictio">Evictio</ref>), and he must also guarantee that the thing has no concealed defects, and that it has all the good qualities which he (the seller) attributes to it. It was with a view to check frauds in sales, and especially in the sales of slaves, that the seller was obliged, by the edict of the curule aediles (see <ref type="cross" target="crossedictum">Edictum</ref>), to inform the buyer of the defects of any slave offered for sale: <title>Qui mancipia vendunt, certiores faciant emtores quod morbi vitiique</title>, etc. In reference to this part of the law, in addition <cb /> to the usual action arising from the contract, the buyer had against the seller, according to the circumstances, an <seg lang="la">actio ex stipulatu, redhibitoria</seg>, and <seg lang="la">quanti minoris.</seg> Horace, in the beginning of the second epistle of the second book, alludes to the precautions to be taken by the buyer and the seller of a slave.

In Greek mythology, the beautiful son of Aëthlius (or, according to another story, of Zeus) and Calycé, daughter of Aeolus, king of Elis, father of Epeus, Aetolus, and Paeon, the first of whom won the government of the country by conquering in a race which his father had set on foot. He was loved by Selené, the moon-goddess, by whom he had fifty daughters. They were supposed to symbolize the fifty lunar months which intervened between the Olympic Games. His grave was at Olympia. Another story made him a shepherd or hunter on Mount Latmos in Caria. Zeus bestowed on him eternal youth and eternal life in the form of unbroken slumber. Selené descended every night from heaven to visit and embrace the beautiful sleeper in his grotto. The usual story, however, makes Selené to have thrown him into a sleep so that she might kiss and caress him without his knowledge. A beautiful statue in the British Museum represents Endymion, and the legend inspired Keats to write one of the most exquisite poems in English literature.

<div2 id="crossennius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ennius">Ennius</head>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossquintus">Quintus</ref>, the “father of Roman poetry,” was born at Rudiae in Calabria, B.C. 239. He served in the Second Punic War and held the post of centurion in Sardinia, whence he was brought to Rome by Cato , B.C. 204. We have no ground for attributing to Cato any appreciation of Ennius's poetical gifts; he was no doubt attracted by his vigour and practical capacity. Established at Rome, Ennius gained a livelihood by giving instruction in the Greek language and by translating Greek plays for the Roman stage. His talents soon brought him recognition. Among those who honoured him with their friendship was the great Africanus, beside whose tomb the poet's bust is said to have been placed. In B.C. 189, he accompanied the consul M. Fulvius Nobilior into his province of Aetolia, expressly to record his exploits. In grateful recollection of this service the <figure id="fig.00593.3">
<head orig="Supposed Bust of Ennius. (Tomb of the Scipios.)">Supposed Bust of Ennius. (Tomb of the Scipios.)</head>
</figure> son of Fulvius in B.C. 184, with the approval of the people, assigned him a lot among the <seg lang="la">triumviri coloniae deducendae</seg>, thus constituting him a Roman citizen. To this he alludes in the last book of his <title>Annales</title> with justifiable pride, <title>Nos sumu' Romani, qui fuimus ante Rudini.</title> His honours did not, however, bring him wealth. Cicero relates that his old age was passed in poverty, but he did not allow this to cloud his genial temper. He is said to have keenly enjoyed the pleasures of convivial 
<pb n="594" /><cb />
 intercourse, and died of an attack of the gout at the age of seventy (B.C. 169).</p>
 <p>Ennius was a remarkably prolific writer, and left untouched few departments of poetical composition. He probably did not commence his literary career till middle life, and he certainly continued it till the time of his death ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 78" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>78</bibl>). In the absence of certain data for determining the chronological order of his writings, it will be best to enumerate them in the order of their importance. His chief work was the <title>Annales</title>, an epic chronicle of Roman history and legend from the time of Aeneas to his own day, in eighteen books, written in hexameter verse. The first twelve books formed a connected poem, and may have been published together B.C. 172 (cf. Aul. Gell. xvii.21.43), though Teuffel thinks the whole work was issued in successive parts of three books each. Of this renowned work, so justly celebrated in antiquity, which gained for its author the title of “the Roman Homer,” sufficient fragments still remain to enable us to appreciate the qualities of his genius, and to deplore the loss of historical and literary material which it contained. The first book seems to have been the most poetical, and is naturally the most often quoted. The longest passages we possess are the Dream of Hia and the Auspices of Romulus and Remus, about ten lines each. The second and third books continued the regal period to its close, but are almost entirely lost to us. In all these the poet made a free use of supernatural machinery. The fourth, fifth, and sixth books began the <title>Annales</title> proper and carried the history of the Republic down to the conquest of Italy and the war with Pyrrhus; of these we possess a few short but striking fragments. In the third triad the Punic Wars were described—the first briefly, as having been already treated by Naevius (for whose rude Saturnian verse Ennius shows much contempt); the second, in which he himself had been an actor, at greater length and not without mythological embellishment. The thirteenth book began with a fresh exordium, as also did the sixteenth, which headed the closing series and brought the history down to B.C. 181 at least, if not somewhat later. The poem gained immediate popularity. It is recorded that large crowds attended its public recitation, and Vergil is said to have “introduced many lines into the <title>Aeneid</title> with the view of pleasing a people devoted to Ennius” (<title>populus Ennianus</title>). Its high estimation continued far into the times of the Empire, as we know from abundant evidence. It is not until Macrobius that we find it falling into neglect.</p>
 <p>Next in importance to the <title>Annales</title> come the tragedies. These were free imitations of Greek dramas, generally those of Euripides, though a few recall by their titles the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles. The list is thus given by Ribbeck: <title>Achilles, Achilles</title> (from Aristarchus), <title>Aiax, Alcumena, Alexander, Andromaché Aechmalotis, Andromeda, Athamas, Cresphontes, Erechtheus, Eumenides, Hectoris Lutra</title> (or <title>Lustra</title>), <title>Hecuba, Iphigenia, Medea Atheniensis, Medea Exul, Menalippa, Nemea, Phoenix, Telamo, Telephus, Thyestes.</title> Their composition extended over the whole period of his literary life, B.C. 204-169, in which latter year the <title>Thyestes</title> was written. It has been doubted whether Ennius used the chorus. If not, such a play as the <title>Eumenides</title>, where the chorus is the chief character, would have had to be entirely recast; and, besides, the criticisms of <cb /> the <title>Ars Poetica</title> presuppose a Roman tragic chorus. The reservation of the orchestra for the senators' seats would, of course, make choral evolutions impossible; but with this exception the plays of Ennius were closely modelled on their Greek originals. The magniloquence of their style and their moral grandeur made them special favourites with the public. Cicero gives them high praise, and it is to him that we are indebted for the greater part of the scanty fragments that remain. A <seg lang="la">praetexta</seg>, entitled <title>Sabinae</title> (Rape of the Sabine Women), has been attributed to Ennius by Vahlen from a passage of Iulius Victor, and there is some ground for conjecturing that the <title>Ambracia</title> was a drama of the same class, celebrating the deeds of Fulvius.</p>
 <p>There also remain, besides the titles, some insignificant traces of two comedies by him—<title>Cupuncula</title> and <title>Pancratiastes.</title> But his bent of mind was unsuited for comedy, and he is mentioned by Volcacius Sedigitus only <seg lang="la">antiquitatis causa!</seg></p>
 <p>Ennius was addicted to philosophical speculations. His convictions oscillated between the mystic doctrines of Pythagoras and the scepticism of Euhemerus. Both found expression in his works. In the <title>Annales</title> he mentioned that the soul of Homer migrated into his own. In the <title>Epicharmus</title>, a distant precursor of the <title>De Rerum Natura</title>, written in trochaic tetrameters, he explained the tenets of Pythagoreanism. In the <title>Euhemerus</title> (erroneously supposed by some to have been a prose work) he adopted the mythologic theory of that superficial writer. It is probable that both these works formed part of the four (or six) books of <title>Saturae</title>—i. e. miscellaneous poems in various metres. To these, also, belonged the <title>Sota</title>, mentioned by Varro; the <title>Protrepticus</title>, or “Art of Life”; the <title>Hedyphagetica</title>, a treatise on gastronomics, based on that of Archestratus of Gela; and a few epigrams, the most celebrated of which were the epitaphs on Africanus and on himself.</p>
 <p>Ennius was filled with a proud and noble selfconsciousness. He entered Rome (1) as a missionary of culture and free-thought; and</p>
 <p>(2) as a consecrator of ancient tradition. He gave to Latin literature an impulse it never quite lost. In nearly every field he led the van. To him, more than to any one, it owes its predominant tone of sober directness and moral strength. In him Greek culture, grafted on an Oscan or Messapian stock, combined with Roman patriotism to form for the first time that special intellectual type, enthusiastic but disciplined, imitative yet independent, Hellenic in source but in development intensely national, which we can trace all through the subsequent course of Roman letters, and most conspicuously in their best and most illustrious representatives. In formal polish he was no doubt deficient; yet he is often imitated by later writers, and by none with happier effect than Vergil.</p>

 <p>A Latin rhetorician and poet. He was born about A.D. 473 in the south of Gaul, and died in 521 as bishop of Pavia. Among other works, he wrote between 504 and 508 an extremely fulsome panegyric on Theodoric the Great and a biography of Epiphanius, his predecessor in the see. Both these writings have a value for the historian. Besides these we have a collection of twenty-eight model speeches (<title>Dictiones</title>), some of which were really delivered; nine books of letters (297 in number) and two of poems, sacred and secular. The first book of poems contains longer, the second shorter and occasional pieces. Both show a certain command of form, and treat of journeys, marriages, etc. The panegyric on Theodoric has been translated into German by Fertig in his work <title>Ennodius und seine Zeit</title> (vols. i. and ii.

<div2 id="crossepaminondas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπαμεινώνδας</foreign>). A Theban statesman and soldier, son of Polymnis, and in whose praise, for both talents and rectitude, there is a remarkable concurrence of ancient writers. Nepos observes that before Epaminondas was born and after his death Thebes was always in subjection to some other power; while he directed her councils she was at the head of Greece. His public life extends from the restoration of democracy by Pelopidas and the other exiles, B.C. 379, to the battle of Mantinea, B.C. 362. In the conspiracy by which that revolution was effected he took no part, but thenceforward he became the prime mover of the Theban State. His policy was first directed to assert the right and to secure the power to Thebes of controlling the other cities of Boeotia, several of which claimed to be independent. In this cause he ventured to engage his country, single-handed, in war with the Spartans, who marched into Boeotia, B.C. 371, with a force superior to any which could be brought against them. The Theban generals were divided in opinion whether a battle should be risked, for to encounter the Lacedaemonians with inferior numbers was universally esteemed hopeless. Epaminondas prevailed upon his colleagues to venture it, and devised on this occasion a new method of attack. Instead of joining battle along the whole line he concentrated an overwhelming force on one point, directing the weaker part of his line to keep back. The Spartan right being broken and their king slain, the rest of the army found it necessary to abandon the field. This memorable battle was fought at Leuctra (B.C. 371). The moral effect of it was much more important than the mere loss inflicted upon Sparta, for it overthrew the prescriptive superiority in arms claimed by that State ever since its reformation by Lycurgus.</p>
 <p>This brilliant success led Epaminondas to the second object of his policy, the overthrow of the supremacy of Sparta and the substitution of Thebes as the leader of Greece in the democratic interest. In this hope a Theban army, under his command, marched into the Peloponnesus early in the winter, B.C. 369, and, in conjunction with the Eleans, Arcadians, and Argives, invaded and laid waste a large part of Laconia. Numbers of the Helots took that opportunity to shake off a most <cb /> oppressive slavery; and Epaminondas struck a deadly blow at the power of Sparta by establishing these descendants of the old Messenians on Mount Ithomé in Messenia, as an independent State, and inviting their countrymen, scattered through Italy and Sicily, to return to their ancient patrimony. Numbers obeyed the call. This memorable event is known in history as the return of the Messenians, and two hundred years had elapsed since their expulsion. In B.C. 368, Epaminondas again led an army into the Peloponnesus; but, not fulfilling the expectations of the people, he was disgraced and, according to Diodorus (xv. 71), was ordered to serve in the ranks: In that capacity he is said to have saved the army in Thessaly when entangled in dangers which threatened it with destruction, being required by the general voice to assume the command. He is not again heard of in a public capacity till B.C. 366, when he was sent to support the democratic interest in Achaia, and by his moderation and judgment brought that whole confederation over to the Theban alliance without bloodshed or banishment. It soon became plain, however, that a mere change of masters—Thebes instead of Sparta—would be of no service to the Grecian States. Achaia first, then Elis, then Mantinea and a great part of Arcadia, returned to the Lacedaemonian alliance. To check this defection, Epaminondas led an army into the Peloponnesus for the fourth time, in B.C. 362. Joined by the Argives, Messenians, and part of the Arcadians, he entered Laconia and endeavoured to take Sparta by surprise; but the vigilance of Agesilaüs just frustrated his scheme. Epaminondas then marched against Mantinea, near which was fought the celebrated battle in which he fell. The disposition of his troops on this occasion was an improvement on that by which he had gained the battle of Leuctra, and would have had the same decisive success, but that, in the critical moment, when the Lacedaemonian line was just broken, he received a mortal wound, said to have been inflicted by Gryllus, the son of Xenophon. The Theban army was paralyzed by this misfortune; nothing was done to profit by a victory which might have been made certain; and this battle, on which the expectation of all Greece waited, led to no important result.</p>
 <p>Whether Epaminondas could much longer have upheld Thebes in the rank to which he had raised her is very doubtful; without him she fell at once to her former obscurity. His character is certainly one of the noblest recorded in Greek history. His private life was moral and refined, his public conduct uninfluenced by personal ambition or by personal hatred. He was a sincere lover of his country; and if, in his schemes for her advancement, he was indifferent to the injury done to other members of the Grecian family, this is a fault from which, perhaps, no Greek statesman except Aristides was free. His life was written in Latin by Cornelius Nepos; and in recent times in German by Bauch <bibl default="NO">(1834)</bibl> and Pomtow <bibl default="NO">(1870)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ἐφέσια</foreign>). A great gathering of Ionians at Ephesus, the ancient capital of the Ionians in Asia. It was held every year, and had, like all <hi rend="italic">panegyreis</hi>, a twofold character—that of a bond of political union among the Greeks of the Ionian race, and that of a common worship of the Ephesian Artemis. Thucydides compares it (iii. 104) to the ancient <ref type="cross" target="crossdelia">Delia</ref> (q.v.). Respecting the particulars of its celebration, we only know that it took place at night and was accompanied with much mirth and feasting, and that mystical sacrifices were offered to the Ephesian goddess ( Thuc. l. c.; Dion. Hal. <title>Antiq. Rom.</title> iv. 25). That games and contests formed likewise a chief part of the solemnities is clear from Hesychius (s. v.), who calls the Ephesia an <foreign lang="greek">ἀγὼν ἐπιφανής</foreign>.

<div2 id="crossephesus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ephĕsus">Ephesus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἔφεσος</foreign>). A city of Ionia, near the mouth of the river Caÿster, called by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 5. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>v. 29</bibl>) <title>alterum lumen Asiae.</title> Mythology assigns, as its founders, Ephesus, the son of the river Caÿster, and Cresus (<foreign lang="greek">Κρῆσος</foreign>), a native of the soil (Pausan. vii. 2). Another account makes it to have been settled by Ephesus, one of the Amazons (Steph. Byzant. s. v.; <title>Etymol. Mag.</title> s. v.). According to a third tradition, the place owed its origin to the Amazons. If we follow the better authority of Strabo, we will find a settlement to have been <figure id="fig.00598">
<head orig="Bronze Coin of Ephesus.">Bronze Coin of Ephesus.</head>
</figure> first made in this quarter by the Carians and Leleges. Androclus, the son of Codrus, came subsequently with a body of Ionian colonists (Pausan. vii. 2). He protected the natives who had settled from devotion about the Temple of Artemis and incorporated them with his followers, but expelled those who inhabited the town above, which the Carians and Leleges had built on Mount Prion (Pausan. l. c.). Pliny enumerates other names for the city, such as Alopé, Morges, Ortygia, Ptelea, Samornia, Smyrna, Trachea, etc.</p>
 <p>Lysimachus, wishing to protect Ephesus from the inundations to which it was yearly exposed by the overflowings of the Caÿster, built a city upon the mountain and surrounded it with walls. The inhabitants were unwilling to remove into this, but a heavy rain falling, and Lysimachus stopping the drains and flooding their houses, they were glad to exchange. The port of Ephesus had originally a wide mouth, but foul with the mud lodging in it from the Caÿster. Attalus Philadelphus and his architect were of opinion that if the entrance were contracted, it would become deeper and in time be capable of receiving ships of burden. But the slime, which had before been moved by the flux and reflux of the tide and carried off, being stopped, the whole basin, quite to the mouth, was rendered shallow. The situation, however, was so advantageous as to overbalance the inconveniences attending the port. The town increased daily, and under the Romans was considered the chief emporium of Asia this side of Taurus. In the arrangement of the provinces under the Eastern emperors it became the capital of the province of Asia. Towards the end of the eleventh century Ephesus experienced the same fate as <ref type="cross" target="crosssmyrna">Smyrna</ref> (q.v.). A Turkish pirate, named Tangripanes, settled here; but the Greek admiral, Ioannes Ducas, defeated him in a bloody battle and pursued the flying Turks up the Maeander to Polybotum. <cb /> In 1306, it was among the places which suffered from the exactions of the Grand Duke Roger; and two years after it surrendered to the sultan Saysan, who, to prevent future insurrections, removed most of the inhabitants to Tyriaeum, where they were massacred. In the conflicts which desolated Asia Minor at a subsequent period, Ephesus was again a sufferer, and the city became at length reduced to a heap of ruins.</p>
 <p>Ephesus was famed for its splendid temple of Artemis or Diana. The statue of the goddess was regarded with peculiar veneration and was believed by the people to have fallen from the skies. It was never changed, though the temple had been more than once restored. This rude object of primeval worship was a block of wood, said by some to be of beech or elm, by others cedar, ebony, or vine, and attesting its very great antiquity by the fashion in which it had been formed. It was carved into the similitude of Artemis, not as the graceful huntress, but an allegorical figure which we may call the goddess of nature, with many breasts, and the lower parts formed into an Hermaean statue, grotesquely ornamented, and discovering the feet beneath. (See illustration on p. 137). It was gorgeously apparelled, the vest embroidered with emblems and symbolical devices, and to prevent its tottering a bar of metal was placed under each hand. A veil or curtain, which was drawn up from the floor to the ceiling, hid it from view, except while service was in progress in the temple. This image was preserved till the later ages in a shrine, on the embellishment of which mines of wealth were consumed. The priests of Artemis suffered emasculation, and virgins were devoted to inviolable chastity. They were eligible only from the superior ranks, and enjoyed a great revenue with privileges, the eventual abuse of which induced Augustus to restrict them.</p>
 <p>The reputation and the riches of their goddess had made the Ephesians desirous of providing for her a magnificent temple. The fortunate discovery of marble in Mount Prion gave them new vigour. The cities of Asia contributed largely, and Croesus defrayed the expense of many of the columns. The spot chosen for it was a marsh, as most likely to preserve the structure free from gaps and uninjured by earthquakes. The foundation was made with charcoal rammed down and with fleeces. The base consumed immense quantities of marble. The edifice was erected on a basement with ten steps. The architects were Chersiphron of Crete and his son Metagenes (B.C. 541); and their plan was continued by Demetrius, a priest of Artemis; but the whole was completed by Daphnis of Miletus and a citizen of Ephesus, the building having occupied 220 years. It was the first specimen of the Ionic style in which the fluted column and capital with volutes were introduced. The whole length of the temple was 425 feet, and the breadth 220; with 127 columns of the Ionic order and of Parian marble, each of a single shaft and sixty feet high. These were donations from kings, according to Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 14</bibl>), but there is reason to doubt the correctness of the text where this assertion is made. Of these columns thirty-six were carved; and one of them, perhaps as a model, by Scopas. The temple had a double row of columns, fifteen on either side; but Vitruvius has not determined if it had a roof, probably over the cell only. The folding-doors or gates had been continued 
<pb n="599" /><cb /> four years in glue, and were made of cypress wood, which had been treasured up for four generations, highly polished. These were found by Mutianus as fresh and as beautiful 400 years after as when new. The ceiling was of cedar; and the steps for ascending the roof were of the single stem of a vine.</p>
 <p>The dimensions of this great temple excite ideas of uncommon grandeur from their massiveness; but the notices of its internal ornament increase one's admiration. It was the repository in which the great artists of antiquity dedicated their most perfect works to posterity. Praxiteles and his son Cephisodorus adorned the shrine; Scopas contributed a statue of Hecaté; Timareté, the daughter of Micon, the first recorded female artist, finished a picture of the goddess, the most ancient in Ephesus; and Parrhasius and Apelles employed their skill to embellish the walls. The excellence of these performances may be supposed to have been proportionate to their price; and a picture of Alexander grasping a thunderbolt, by the latter, was added to the superb collection at the expense of twenty talents of gold. This description, however, applies chiefly to the temple as it was rebuilt, after the earlier temple had been partially burned (perhaps the roof of timber only), by Herostratus, who chose that method to ensure to himself an immortal name, on the very night that Alexander the Great was born. Twenty years after, that magnificent prince, during his expedition against Persia, offered to appropriate his spoils to the restoration of it if the Ephesians would consent to allow him the sole honour and would place his name on the temple. They declined the proposal, however, with the flattering remark that it was not right for one deity to erect a temple to another; national vanity was, however, the real ground of their refusal. The architect who superintended the erection of the new edifice was Dinocrates, of whose aid Alexander afterwards availed himself in building Alexandria (Vitruv. ii. praef.;  <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 72" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Alex.</title>72</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>vii. 37</bibl>; Solin. 40). The extreme sanctity of the temple inspired universal awe and reverence; and it was for many ages a repository of foreign and domestic treasure. There property, whether public or private, was secure amid all revolutions. The conduct of Xerxes was an example to subsequent conquerors, and the impiety of sacrilege was not suffered by the Ephesian goddess; but Nero deviated from this rule in removing many costly offerings and images and an immense quantity of silver and gold. It was again plundered by the Goths from beyond the Danube in the time of Gallienus—a party under Raspa crossing the Hellespont and ravaging the country until compelled to retreat, when they carried off a prodigious booty.</p>
 <p>The destruction of so illustrious an edifice deserved to have been carefully recorded by contemporary historians. We may conjecture that it followed the triumph of Christianity. The Ephesian reformers, when authorized by the imperial edicts, rejoiced in the opportunity of insulting Artemis, and deemed it piety to demolish the very ruin of her habitation. When, under the auspices of Constantine and Theodosius, churches were erected, the pagan temples were despoiled of their ornaments or accommodated to other worship. The immense dome of Saint Sophia now rises from the columns of green jasper which were originally <cb /> placed in the Temple of Artemis, and were taken down and brought to Constantinople by order of Justinian. Two pillars in the great church at Pisa were also transported thence. The very site of this stupendous and celebrated edifice was long undetermined, but in 1869 was discovered by Mr. T. Wood—an Englishman who found a clue to its situation in two letters from Antoninus Pius to the Ephesians (A.D. 145-150); in another letter from Hadrian, dated September 27th, A.D. 120; and in an inscription which prescribed the order of the processions to the temple. Excavations continued until 1874 have greatly added to our knowledge of the temple.

<head orig="Ephĕtae">Ephetae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐφέται</foreign>). A judicial court of high antiquity at Athens, consisting of fifty-one judges elected from the noblest Athenian families. It gave decisions in cases of murder at five different places, differing according to the character of the case. If the crime had a religious character, the Archon Basileus presided. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossarchon">Archon</ref>.) Solon did not abolish this court, but handed over to the newly organized <ref type="cross" target="crossareopagus">Areopagus</ref> (q.v.) its most important functions—the power of deciding cases of intentional murder, poisoning, malicious wounding, arson, and the like. The nearest relations of the murdered person were bound by religious sanction to avenge his blood. At the funeral, and after that in the market-place, they uttered a solemn denunciation, which bade the murderer keep away from all public places, assemblies, and sanctuaries, and to appear before the court. The Archon Basileus, after the charge had been announced and received, repeated this denunciation. The preliminary investigation, and determination of the place where the court was to be held, followed at three appointed times in three successive months. The case was not finally dealt with till the fourth month. On the first two days of the final trial the two parties, after solemnly taking an oath, conducted their case in person. On the third day judgment was given, in case the accused had not gone into voluntary exile. If he had, his property was confiscated, but he was pursued no further. Intentional murder was punished with death, malicious wounding with exile; the man's property was confiscated in both cases. In the court of Areopagus if the votes of the judges were equal the accused was acquitted. If the homicide were legally allowed (as, for instance, that of an adulterer) or legally innocent (as in self-defence), the case was investigated in the Delphinium, a sanctuary of the Delphic Apollo; and only a religious purification was exacted. Cases of unintentional homicide, murder of an alien, and instigation to murder, were taken at the Palladium, a sanctuary of Pallas. Instigation to murder was punished with banishment and confiscation of property, the murder of an alien with banishment, unintentional murder with banishment until the kinsmen of the murdered person gave permission to the slayer to return. In the time of Demosthenes it would seem that the cases which used to be heard at the Delphinium and Palladium were handed over to the Heliastae. Thus the Ephetae had only two courts left them—that in Phreatto, a place in the Piraeus, 
<pb n="600" /><cb />
 near the sea, and the Prytaneum. The former had only to judge in the rare event of a person banished for unintentional homicide being charged with intentional murder.

<head orig="Ephippium">Ephippium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐφίππιον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐφίππειον</foreign>). A saddlecloth or pad. The saddle with a “tree” was unknown till the fourth century, although the packsaddle seems to be of much earlier occurrence.</p>
 <p>In the absence of stirrups (later <hi rend="italic">staffae, stapides</hi>, etc.), which are not mentioned till the emperor Mauricius (A.D. 602), there were several ways of mounting—as jumping with or without the aid of a lance-shaft, with the assistance of others (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναβολεῖς</foreign>), or from steps (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνάβαθρα</foreign>). The last were set up, according to Plutarch, along the main roads by C. Gracchus. Or, the horse was taught to kneel at the word of command (Sil. Ital. x. 465).</p>
 <p>In more ancient art the horse is represented ridden bare-backed. Later, saddle-cloths, often double or with pads beneath, and fastened with one to three girths, appear with increasing frequency. The most elaborate trappings of this kind are seen on Scythian antiquities of the fourth century B.C.</p>
 <p>The use of trappings was originally regarded as effeminate by the Romans (Varro on Cato , <title>De</title> <figure id="fig.00600">
<head orig="Ephippium. (Coin of Labienus.)">Ephippium. (Coin of Labienus.)</head>
</figure> <title>Lib. Educ.</title>), but they were used in pomps. Their development may be seen by a comparison of the examples appearing on the columns of Trajan, Antoninus, and Theodosius. On the first and second, and in the equestrian statue of M. Aurelius, are to be seen cloths alone, and pads filling up the hollow of the horse's back with and without cloths. It is only on the Theodosian Column that the true saddle, with a bow behind and before, appears for the first time. The new name <seg lang="la">sella</seg> now emphasizes the new fashion.

<div2 id="crossephori" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ephŏri">Ephori</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔφοροι</foreign>, “overseers”). A board of five members at Sparta, elected annually from all the citizens. It is said to have been established by Lycurgus or King Theopompus (B.C. 770). The original intention was that it should give decisions in private matters, and represent the absent kings in certain of their duties, especially in the superintendence of the officials and of public discipline. <cb /> But their circle of authority gradually widened, till it came to mean a superintendence over the whole commonwealth, including the kings. The ephors had the right of raising objections against their actions, calling them, like other officials, to account for their conduct, punishing them with fines and reprimands, and even prosecuting them before the Senate, and threatening them with deposition and death. They were the only citizens who were not obliged to rise in the kings' presence, a fact which gives a good idea of the relative position of the two parties. Besides the duty of opposing everything which they thought adverse to the laws and interests of Sparta, they had from early times the right of summoning the deliberative and legislative assemblies, the <foreign lang="greek">Γερουσία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ἐκκλησία</foreign>, to make proposals to them, and take the lead in proceedings left to their management. Two of them regularly accompanied the kings on their campaigns. It is probable also that they had the superintendence of the public treasure. In their capacity of protectors of the public discipline their authority extended itself to the minutest details of private life. In regard to the Helots and Perioeci it was still more absolute. Even on a <hi rend="italic">perioecus</hi> they could pass sentence of death without trial. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossperioeci">Perioeci</ref>.) On important occasions a majority of their votes was required. At the end of their annual office, on which they entered at the beginning of the Spartan year or at the time of the autumnal equinox, they were liable to be called to account by their successors. The year was dated by the name of the first ephor on the board.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβάται</foreign>).

In consequence of the number of heavy-armed men <foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ καταλόγου</foreign> on the expedition, the Athenians appear to have reduced the number of regular epibatae from ten to seven.</p>
 <p>The epibatae were usually taken from the Thetes, or fourth class of Athenian citizens ( <bibl n="Thuc.  6. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.vi. 42</bibl>); but on one occasion, in a season of extraordinary danger, the citizens of the higher classes were compelled to serve as epibatae ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii. 24</bibl>).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβολή</foreign>). A fine imposed by a magistrate on any official, or official body, for a misdemeanor. The various magistrates at Athens had, each in his own department, a summary penal jurisdiction—i. e. for certain offences they might inflict a pecuniary mulct or fine, not exceeding a fixed amount; if the offender deserved further punishment, it was their duty to bring him before a judicial tribunal, the magistrate proposing the penalty. Thus, in case of injury done to orphans and heiresses, or of misconduct at the great Dionysia, the archon might fine the parties; the generals could fine a phylarch for disobedience; the same power belonged to the <foreign lang="greek">τειχοποιοί</foreign> ( <title>c. Ctes.</title> 27). If the person fined would not submit to it, the magistrate had to lay the case before a court ( <title>pro Milit.</title> 11): that was always required when a demarch imposed a fine (<title>C. I. A.</title> ii. 573 b). The amount of the fine (<foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>) which the individual magistrate might inflict, we do not know; the Senate of Five Hundred was competent to fine to the extent of 500 drachmas.</p>
 <p>These <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιβολαί</foreign> are to be distinguished from the penalties awarded by a jury or court of law (<foreign lang="greek">τιμήματα</foreign>) upon a formal prosecution, and from the fine of a thousand drachmas, which the accuser in a public action incurred when he dropped his accusation or failed to obtain a fifth part of the votes, or when a citizen refused to obey the summons to appear as a witness in court; in all these cases the magistrates had no discretionary power.

<div2 id="crossepicharmus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epicharmus">Epicharmus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπίχαρμος</foreign>). The first Greek comic writer of whom we have any definite account. He was a Syracusan, either by birth or emigration (Theocr. <bibl n="Germ.  Epig. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epig.</title>17</bibl>). Some writers make him a native of the island of Cos, but all agree that he passed his life at Syracuse. It was about B.C. 500, thirty-five years after Thespis began to exhibit, eleven years after the commencement of Phrynichus, and just before the appearance of Aeschylus as a tragedian, that Epicharmus produced the first comedy properly so called. Before him, this department of the drama was little more than a series of licentious songs and sarcastic episodes, without plot, connection, or consistency. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomoedia">Comoedia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdrama">Drama</ref>.) He gave to each exhibition continuity, and converted the loose interlocutions into regular dialogue (Aristot. <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 5. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>v. 5</bibl>). The subjects of his Doric comedies, as we may infer from the extant titles of thirty-five of them, were partly parodies of mythological subjects, and, as such, not very different from the dialogue of the satyric drama, and partly political, and in this respect may have furnished a model for the dialogue of the Athenian comedy. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrhinthonica-fabula">Rhinthonica Fabula</ref>.) Tragedy had, some years before the era of Epicharmus, begun to assume its dignified character. The woes of heroes and the majesty of the gods had, under Phrynicus, become its favourite themes. The Sicilian poet seems to have been struck with the idea of exciting the mirth of his audience by the exhibition of some ludicrous matter dressed up in all the grave solemnity of the <cb /> newly invented art. Discarding, therefore, the low drolleries and scurrilous invectives of the ancient <foreign lang="greek">κωμῳδία</foreign>, he opened a novel and less objectionable source of amusement by composing a set of burlesque dramas upon the usual tragic subjects. They succeeded, and the turn thus given to comedy long continued; so that when it once more returned to personality and satire, as it afterwards did, tragedy and tragic poets were the constant objects of its parody and ridicule. The great changes thus effected by Epicharmus justly entitled him to be called the Inventor of Comedy (Theocr. <bibl n="Germ.  Epig. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epig.</title>17</bibl>), though it is probable that Phormis or Phormus preceded him by a few Olympiads (Aristot. <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 3. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>iii. 5</bibl>). But his merits do not rest here: he was distinguished for elegance of composition as well as originality of conception. Demetrius Phalereus says that Epicharmus excelled in the choice and collocation of epithets, on which account the name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπιχάρμιος</foreign> was given to his kind of style, making it proverbial for elegance and beauty. So many were his dramatic excellences that Plato terms him the king of comic writers, and in a later age and foreign country Plautus chose him as his model ( <title>Epist.</title> ii. 1. 58) and is thought to have borrowed from him the plot of the <title>Menaechmi.</title> The parasite who figures so greatly in the plays of the New Comedy and in those of Plautus was first brought upon the stage by Epicharmus.</p>
 <p>The plays of Epicharmus, to judge from the fragments still left us, abounded in apophthegms, little consistent with the ideas we might otherwise have entertained of their nature from our knowledge of the buffooneries whence his comedy sprang and of the writings of Aristophanes, his partially extant successor. Epicharmus, however, was a philosopher and a Pythagorean ( <bibl n="Diog.  8. 78" default="NO">Diog. Laert.viii. 78</bibl>). We find Epicharmus still composing comedies B.C. 485 (Suidas, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπίχ</foreign>.), and again during the reign of Hiero, B.C. 477. He died at the age of ninety or ninety-seven years. Epicharmus is said by some authorities to have added the letters <foreign lang="greek">ξ, η, ψ, ω</foreign> to the Greek alphabet, but inscriptions show that these characters were in use at Miletus half a century before his reputed birth.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign>, also <foreign lang="greek">ἐπικληρῖτις</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔγκληρος</foreign>). The name given to the daughter or daughters of an Athenian citizen who had no son, or 
<pb n="602" /><cb />
 whose sons had died leaving no male issue. The <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign> was not, in our sense of the word, an “heiress,” but rather a person who went with the estate. The heir was either the person to whom her father had devised the property on condition of marrying her, or her son or sons. It was deemed an object of importance at Athens to preserve the <foreign lang="greek">οἶκος</foreign>. This was effected, where a man had no child, by adoption (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσποίησις</foreign>); if he had no sons or grandsons, but a daughter, he might bequeath his property to any person, but the devisee was obliged to marry her; on the other hand, if he died intestate, her nearest relative might claim her in marriage, and the inheritance was transmitted through her to a grandson, who was, when of full age, adopted into the maternal grandfather's family (Isae.  <bibl n="Plut. Pyrrh. 73" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pyrrh.</title>73</bibl>). Such an epiclerus might be claimed in marriage by her father's brothers, or in default of such by their sons or by the sons of her father's sisters, or by her father's uncles. If the daughter was poor (<foreign lang="greek">θῆσσα</foreign>), the nearest of kin was bound by law either to marry her himself or to portion her, the law fixing a sliding scale for the different classes of the census— e. g. 500 drachmas, if he be of the highest class, etc. If there were several in the same degree of consanguinity, each of them had to contribute their share (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸς μέρος</foreign>). Upon the nearest relative making his claim before the archon, public notice was given of the claim; it was written on the <foreign lang="greek">σανίς</foreign>, and read out in the following assembly ( <bibl n="Poll.  8. 95" default="NO">Poll.viii. 95</bibl>), and at a later day the herald put the question <foreign lang="greek">εἴ τις ἀμφισβητεῖν ἢ παρακαταβάλλειν βούλεται</foreign>. If no one appeared to dispute the claim, the archon adjudged the heiress to him; if other claimants appeared, the archon instituted an anakrisis, and a court was held for the decision of the right, which was determined according to the Athenian law of consanguinity.</p>
 <p>Even when a woman was already married, her husband was obliged to give her up to a man with a better title; and men sometimes put away their former wives in order to marry heiresses (Isae.  <bibl n="Plut. Pyrrh. 64" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pyrrh.</title>64</bibl>). Even after the decision of the court had been given in favour of one claimant, any other person who could show a better title might bring an action against the husband and claim the heiress ([Demosth.] <title>c. Macart.</title> p. 1054. 16). The limit of time for making such a claim is not known.</p>
 <p>The estate never passed into the possession of the husband of the heiress (Isae. <title>Ciron.</title> 31); their son when of full age was adopted into his maternal grandfather's family (Isae.  <bibl n="Plut. Pyrrh. 73" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pyrrh.</title>73</bibl>) and took possession of the estate. He then became his mother's legal protector (<foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>), and was bound to find her maintenance. If there were more sons, they shared the property equally. There were epicleri at Mitylené and Phocis. With the Lycians daughters only could inherit.

<div2 id="crossepictetus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epictētus">Epictetus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπίκτητος</foreign>). An eminent Stoic philosopher, born in a servile condition at Hierapolis in Phrygia, about A.D. 50. The names of his parents are unknown; neither do we know how he came to be brought to Rome. But in that city he was for some time a slave to Epaphroditus, a freedman of Nero, who had been one of his body-guard. An anecdote related by Origen, which illustrates the fortitude of Epictetus, would also show, if it were true, that Epaphroditus was a most cruel master. Epictetus, when his master was twisting his leg one day, smiled and quietly said, “You will break it”; and when he did break it, only observed, “Did I not tell you that you would do so?” It is not known how or when Epictetus managed to effect his freedom, but he could not have been still a slave when he left Rome in consequence of an edict against philosophers. This event, the only one in his life the date of which can be assigned, took place, as has been said, in the year A.D. 89, being the eighth year of Domitian's reign. Epictetus then retired to Nicopolis in Epirus, and it is a question whether he ever returned to Rome. The chief ground for believing that he did is a statement of Spartianus ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 16" default="NO"> <title>Hadr.</title>16</bibl>), that Epictetus lived on terms of intimacy with the emperor Hadrian; while it is agreed, on the other hand, that there is no good evidence of any of his discourses having been delivered at Rome, but that they contain frequent mention of Nicopolis. This argument, however, is hardly sufficient to overthrow the express testimony of Spartianus. It is not known when he died. Suidas says that he lived till the reign of Marcus Aurelius, yet the authority of Aulus Gellius is strong on the other side. He, writing during the reign of the first Antonine, speaks of Epictetus, in two places, as being dead (<title>Noct. Att.</title> ii. 18; xvii. 19).</p>
 <p>Epictetus led a life of exemplary contentment, simplicity, and virtue, practising in all particulars the morality which he taught. He lived for a long while in a small hut, with no other furniture than a bed and a lamp, and without an attendant; until he benevolently adopted a child whom a friend had been compelled by poverty to expose, and hired a nurse for its sake. A teacher of the Stoic philosophy, he was the chief of those who lived during the period of the Roman Empire. His lessons were principally, if not solely, directed to practical morality. His favourite maxim, and that into which he resolved all practical morality, was “bear and forbear,” <foreign lang="greek">ἀνέχου καὶ ἀπέχου</foreign>. He appears to have differed from the Stoics on the subject of suicide. We are told by Arrian, in his Preface to the <title>Discourses</title>, that he was a powerful and inspiring lecturer; and, according to Origen (<title>c. Cels.</title> 7, <seg lang="la">ad init.</seg>), his style was superior to that of Plato. It is a proof of the estimation in which Epictetus was held, that, on his death, his lamp was purchased by some aspirant after philosophy more eager than wise for 3000 drachmas, or over $500. Though it is said by Suidas that Epictetus wrote much, there is good reason to believe that he himself wrote nothing. His <foreign lang="greek">Διατριβαί</foreign> were taken down by his pupil Arrian, and published after his death in eight books, of which four remain. The same Arrian compiled the <title>Enchiridion</title> or “manual,” an abstract of the teaching of 
<pb n="603" /><cb />
 his master, and wrote a life of Epictetus, which is lost. Some fragments have been preserved, however, by Stobaeus. Simplicius has also left a commentary on his doctrine in the Eclectic manner. The best edition of the remains of Epictetus is still that of Schweighäuser, 5 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1800)</bibl>.

<head orig="Epicūrus">Epicurus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπίκουρος</foreign>). A celebrated philosopher, born in the year B.C. 341, in the island of Samos, whither his father had gone from Athens, in the year B.C. 352, among 2000 colonists then sent out by the Athenians. Yet he was an Athenian by right, belonging to the deme Gargettus and to the tribe Aegeïs. His father Neocles is said to have been a school-master, and his mother Chaeristrata to have practised arts of magic, in which it was afterwards made a charge against Epicurus that, when he was young, he assisted her ( <bibl n="Diog.  10. 4" default="NO">Diog. Laert.x. 4</bibl>). Having passed his early years in Samos and Teos, he went to Athens at the age of eighteen. He had begun to study philosophy when only fourteen, from a desire, which the teachers to whom he had applied had failed to satisfy, of understanding Hesiod's description of chaos. In Samos he is said to have received lessons from Pamphilus, a follower of Plato ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 1. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>i. 26</bibl>). On the occasion of this his first visit to Athens, Epicurus stayed there for a very short time. He left it in consequence of the measures taken by Perdiccas after the death of Alexander the Great, and went to Colophon to join his father. In B.C. 310, he went to Mitylené, where he set up a school. Staying only one year at this latter place, he next proceeded to Lampsacus, where he taught for four years. He returned to Athens in the year B.C. 306, and now founded the school which ever after was named from him the Epicurean. He purchased a garden (<foreign lang="greek">Κῆποι Ἐπικούρου</foreign>) for eighty minae (about $1450), wherein he might live with his disciples and deliver his lectures, and henceforth remained in Athens, with the exception only of two or three visits to his friends in Asia Minor, until his death, from stone in the bladder, B.C. 270. He was in his seventy-second year when he died, and he had then been settled in Athens as a teacher for thirty-six years.</p>
 <p>Epicurus is said by Diogenes Laertius (x. 9) to have had so many pupils that even whole cities could not contain them. Hearers came to him from distant places; and while men often deserted other schools to join that of Epicurus, there were only two instances, at most, of Epicurus being deserted for any other teacher. Epicurus and his pupils lived together in the garden of which we have spoken, in a state of friendship, which, as it is usually represented, could not be surpassed—abstaining from putting their property together and enjoying it in common for the quaint yet significant reason that such a plan implied mutual distrust. The friendship subsisting between Epicurus and his pupils is commemorated by Cicero (<title>De Fin.</title> i. 20). In this garden, too, they lived in the most frugal and decorous manner, though it was the delight of the enemies of Epicurus to represent it differently, and though Timocrates, who had once been his pupil and had abandoned <cb /> him, spread such gossip as that Epicurus used to vomit twice a day after a surfeit and that harlots were inmates of the garden. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossleontium">Leontium</ref>.) An inscription over the gate of the garden told him who might be disposed to enter that barleycakes and water would be the fare provided for him ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>31</bibl>); and such was the chastity of Epicurus that one of his principal opponents, Chrysippus, endeavoured to account for it, so as to deny him any merit, by saying that he was without passions ( <title>Serm.</title> 117). Epicurus remained unmarried, in order that he might be able to prosecute philosophy without interruption. His most attached friends and pupils were Hermachus of Mitylené, whom he appointed by will to succeed him as master of the school; Metrodorus, who wrote several books in defence of his system; and Polyaenus. Epicurus's three brothers, Neocles, Chaeredemus, and Aristobulus, also followed his philosophy, as also one of his servants, Mys, whom at his death he made free. Besides the garden in Athens, from which the followers of Epicurus, in succeeding time, came to be named “the philosophers of the garden” ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 13. 122" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>xiii. 122</bibl>; xiv. 319), Epicurus possessed a house in Melité, a village near Athens, to which he used often to retire with his friends. On his death he left this house, together with the garden, to Hermachus, as head of the school, to be left by him again to whosoever might be his successor. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseducation">Education</ref>.</p>
 <p>In physics Epicurus trod pretty closely in the footsteps of Democritus; so much so, indeed, that he was accused of taking his atomic cosmology from that philosopher without acknowledgment. He made very few, and these unimportant, alterations. According to Epicurus, as also to Democritus and Leucippus before him, the universe consists of two parts, matter (<foreign lang="greek">σῶμα</foreign>) and space, or vacuum (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ κενόν</foreign>), in which matter exists and moves; and all matter, of every kind and form, is reducible to certain indivisible particles or atoms (<foreign lang="greek">ἄτομοι</foreign>), which are eternal. These atoms, moving, according to a natural tendency, straight downward, and also obliquely, have thereby come to form the different bodies which are found in the world, and which differ in kind and shape, according as the atoms are differently placed in respect to one another. It is clear that, in this system, a creator is dispensed with; and indeed Epicurus, here again following Democritus, set about to prove, in an <seg lang="la">a priori</seg> way, that this creator could not exist, inasmuch as nothing could arise out of nothing, any more than it could utterly perish and becoming nothing. The atoms have existed always, and always will exist; and all the various physical phenomena are brought about, from time to time, by their various motions. The soul itself is made of a finer and more subtle kind of atoms, which, when the body dies and decays, separate and are dissipated. The various processes of sense are explained on the principles of materialism. From the surfaces of all objects continually flow thin, filmy images of things (<foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλα</foreign>), which, by impact on the organism, cause the phenomena of vision, hearing, etc.</p>
 <p>It remains to speak of the Epicurean system of ethics. Setting out with the two facts that man is susceptible of pleasure and pain and that he seeks the one and avoids the other, Epicurus declared that it is a man's duty to endeavour to increase to the utmost his pleasures and diminish 
<pb n="604" /><cb />
 to the utmost his pains—choosing that which tends to pleasure rather than that which tends to pain, and that which tends to a greater pleasure or to a lesser pain rather than that which tends respectively to a lesser pleasure or a greater pain. He used the terms pleasure and pain in the most comprehensive way, as including pleasure and pain of both mind and body; and esteemed the pleasures and pains of the mind as incomparably greater than those of the body. The highest pleasure, then, is peace of mind (<foreign lang="greek">ἀταραξία, ἀπονία</foreign>), and this comes from <foreign lang="greek">φρόνησις</foreign> or the ability to decide what line of conduct will best secure true happiness. Death, he says, is not to be feared, for “where we are, death is not; and where death is, we are not.” <figure id="fig.00604">
<head orig="Epicurus. (Baumeister.)">Epicurus. (Baumeister.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The period at which Epicurus opened his school was peculiarly favourable. In place of the simplicity of the Socratic doctrine, nothing now remained but the subtlety and affectation of Stoicism, the unnatural severity of the Cynics, or the debasing doctrine of indulgence taught and practised by the followers of Aristippus. The luxurious refinement which now prevailed in Athens, while it rendered every rigid scheme of philosophy, as well as all grossness of manners, unpopular, inclined the younger citizens to listen to a preceptor who smoothed the stern and wrinkled brow of philosophy, and, under the notion of conducting his followers to enjoyment in the bower of tranquillity, led them unawares into the path of moderation and virtue. Hence the popularity of his school. It cannot be denied, however, that from the time when this philosopher appeared to the present day, an uninterrupted course of censure has fallen upon his memory; so that the name of his sect has almost become a proverbial expression for everything corrupt in principle and infamous in character. The charges brought against Epicurus are that he superseded all religious principles by dismissing the gods from the care of the world; that if he acknowledged their existence, it was only in conformity to popular prejudice, since, according to his system, nothing exists in nature but material atoms; that he showed great insolence and vanity in the disrespect with which <cb /> he treated the memory of former philosophers and the characters and persons of his contemporaries; and that both he and his disciples were addicted to the grossest sensuality.</p>
 <p>With respect to the first charge, it certainly admits of no refutation. The doctrine of Epicurus concerning nature militated directly against the agency of a Supreme Being in the formation and government of the world, and his misconceptions with respect to mechanical motion and the nature of divine happiness led him to divest the Deity of some of his primary attributes. It is not true, however, that he entirely denied the existence of superior powers. Cicero charges him with inconsistency in having written books concerning piety and the reverence due to the gods, and in maintaining that the gods ought to be worshipped, while he asserted that they had no concern in human affairs. That there was an inconsistency in this is obvious. But Epicurus professed that the universal prevalence of the ideas of gods was sufficient to prove that they existed; and, thinking it necessary to derive these ideas, like all other ideas, from sensations, he imagined that the gods were beings of human form and made known to men by the customary emanations. He believed that these gods were eternal and supremely happy, living in the intermundane spaces (<foreign lang="greek">μετακόσμια</foreign>) in a state of quiet, and meddling not with the affairs of the world. He contended that they were to be worshipped on account of the excellence of their nature, and not because they could do men either good or harm ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 1. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>i. 41</bibl>;  <bibl n="Sen. Ben. 4. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Sen. <title>Ben.</title>iv. 19</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The Epicurean school was carried on, after Hermachus, by Polystratus and many others, concerning whom nothing is known; and the doctrines which Epicurus had taught underwent few modifications. When introduced among the Romans, these doctrines, though very much opposed at first, were yet adopted by many distinguished men, as Lucretius, Atticus, and Horace. Under the emperors, Pliny the Younger and Lucian of Samosata were noted Epicureans. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslucretius-carus">Lucretius</ref>.</p>
 <p>Our chief sources of information respecting the doctrines of Epicurus are the tenth book of Diogenes Laertius and the poem of Lucretius, <title>De Rerum Natura.</title> Information is also furnished by the writings of Cicero, especially the <title>De Finibus</title> and the <title>De Natura Deorum;</title> by those of Seneca, and by the treatise of Plutarch, “Against Colotes.” Epicurus, according to Diogenes Laertius, was a more voluminous writer than any other philosopher, having written as many as 300 volumes, in all of which he is said to have studiously avoided making quotations. All that now remains of his works are the letters contained in the tenth book of Diogenes Laertius and parts of two books of his treatise on Nature (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φύσεως</foreign>), which were discovered at Herculaneum. The last were published at Leipzig in 1818, being edited by Orelli; further fragments will be found in the sixth volume of the <title>Hercul. Voll.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδόσεις</foreign>). Voluntary contributions, either in money, arms, or ships, which were made by the Athenian citizens in order to meet the extraordinary demands of the State. When the expenses of the State were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the prytanes to summon an assembly of the people, and after explaining the necessities of the State, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means. Those who were willing to contribute then rose and mentioned what they would give, while those who were unwilling to give anything remained silent or retired privately from the assembly. The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the Eponymi, where they remained till paid.</p>
 <p>These <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιδόσεις</foreign>, or voluntary contributions, were frequently very large.

<div2 id="crossepigoni" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epigŏni">Epigoni</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπίγονοι</foreign>, “descendants”). The sons of the Grecian heroes who were killed in the First Theban War. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspolynices">Polynices</ref>.) The War of the Epigoni is famous in ancient history. It was undertaken ten years after the first. The sons of those who had perished in the first war resolved to avenge the death of their fathers. The god, when consulted, promised them victory if led by Alcmaeon , the son of Amphiaraüs. Alcmaeon accordingly took the command. Another account, however, given by Pausanias (ix. 9, 2), makes Thersander, son of Polynices, to have been at the head of the expedition. The other leaders were Amphilochus, brother of Alcmaeon ; Aegialeus, son of Adrastus; Diomedes, of Tydeus; Promachus, of Parthenopaeus; Sthenelus, of Capaneus; and Eurypylus, of Mecisteus. The Argives were assisted by the Messenians, Arcadians, Corinthians, and Megarians. The Thebans obtained aid from the neighbouring States. The invaders ravaged the villages about Thebes. A battle ensued, in which Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, slew Aegialeus, and fell himself by the spear of Alcmaeon. The Thebans then fled; and, by the advice of Tiresias, they secretly left their city, which was entered and plundered by the Argives, and Thersander was placed on the throne.</p>
 <p>With the exception of the events of the Trojan War and the return of the Greeks, nothing was so closely connected with the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> as the War of the Argives against Thebes, since many of the principal heroes of Greece, particularly Diomedes and Sthenelus, were themselves among the conquerors of Thebes, and their fathers before them, a bolder and wilder race, had fought on the same spot, in a contest which, although unattended with victory, was still far from inglorious. Hence, also, reputed Homeric poems on the subject of this war were extant, which perhaps really bore a great affinity to the Homeric time and school. The second part of the <title>Thebaïs</title>, which related to the exploits of the Epigoni, was, according to Pausanias (ix. 9, 2), ascribed by some to Homer himself. The <title>Epigoni</title> was still commonly ascribed to Homer in the time of Herodotus (iv. 32). See <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>.

<div2 id="crossepigramma" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epigramma">Epigramma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίγραμμα</foreign>). Properly an inscription, such as was often written upon a tomb, a votive offering, a present, a work of art, and the like, to describe its character. Inscriptions of this sort were from early times put into metrical form, and the writer generally tried to combine good sense and spirit in them. They were generally, though not always, written in the elegiac metre.</p>
 <p>The greatest master of Greek epigram was Simonides of Ceos, the author of several of the sepulchral inscriptions on the warriors who fell in the Persian Wars. His lines are remarkable for repose, clearness, and force, both of thought and expression. Fictitious inscriptions were often written, containing 
<pb n="606" /><cb /> brief criticisms on celebrated men—as poets, philosophers, artists—and their productions. The form of the epigram was also used to embody in concise and pointed language the clever ideas or the passing moods of the writer, often with a tinge of wit or satire. The occasional epigram was a very favourite form of composition with the Alexandrian poets, and remained so down to the latest times. Some writers, indeed, devoted themselves entirely to it. Many of the choicest gems of Greek literature are to be found in the epigrams. The epigrammatists used other metres besides the elegiac, especially the iambic. In later times more complex and almost lyrical measures were employed. The Greek Anthology has preserved some 4500 epigrams, of the greatest variety in contents, and from the hand of more than 300 poets. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossanthology">Anthology</ref>.) Among these are found some of the most celebrated names of ancient and of later times. A great number of epigrams are also found in inscriptions.</p>
 <p>Of all the Greek varieties of lyric poetry, the epigram was earliest welcomed at Rome. It lived on in an uninterrupted existence from Ennius till the latest times, being employed sometimes for inscriptions, sometimes for other and miscellaneous purposes. In the first application, the epigram was used after Ennius on sepulchral monuments, utensils, works of art, etc. In the first century B.C. epigrams were written by Pompilius, Q. Lutatius Catulus, Varro Atacinus, Licinius Calvus, and by others to whom erotic verses are ascribed. Many of the short poems of Catullus are truly epigrammatic, and in the second half of the first century A.D. Martial handled the epigram in various forms and with the power of a master. Augustus Caesar, Pedo , Cornificia, Sulpicia , and Gaetulius also wrote epigrams. Ausonius has several examples. We also have a collection of epigrams by Luxorius in the sixth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">a. d</hi>. Many such poems are preserved in inscriptions, besides a great number in manuscript, which in modern times have been collected into a Latin Anthology. In its last form of development, the epigram figures largely in the writings of modern Latinists—the most successful of whom in this department were Bembo, Scaliger, Buchanan, More, Stroza, Sannazarius, Melanchthon, Porson, and Landor. Scaliger, in the third book of his <title>Poetics</title>, classifies the epigram according to its possession of <seg lang="la">mel</seg> (adulatory epigram), <hi rend="italic">fel</hi> (vindictive epigram), <hi rend="italic">sal</hi> (witty epigram), and <hi rend="italic">acetum</hi>—with a fifth class combining two or more of these components. An excellent epigrammatic definition of the epigram is the following of unknown authorship: <lb />“Omne epigramma sit instar apis: sit aculeus illi; <lb />Sint sua mella; sit et corporis exigui.”</p>
 <p>This has been cleverly paraphrased in English as follows: <lb />“The qualities rare in a bee that we meet, <lb />In an epigram never should fail: <lb />The body should always be little and sweet, <lb />And a sting should be left in its tail.”</p>
 <p>A French writer, Lebrun, has left the following epigrammatic comparison of the merits of Catullus and Martial:
 <quote lang="fr"><lg type="alexandrine" org="uniform" sample="complete">

 <p> From <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιγράφειν</foreign>=<seg lang="la">inscribere.</seg> A word conventionally used to describe the scientific study of inscriptions. In its widest sense it has reference to all inscriptions, including words engraved on rings, or stamped on coins, lamps, jars, vases, and other articles of use or ornament; but more strictly it relates to the historical inscriptions carved upon slabs of stone (i. e. lapidary inscriptions), or upon plates of bronze and other metal. Classical philology and archaeology owe an inestimable debt to the study of the inscriptions that have been preserved to us from the Greek and Roman world, and to the inscriptions of these two great centres of civilization this short sketch must be confined. (For other epigraphic remains, see the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossassyria">Assyria</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylonia">Babylonia</ref>; Cuneiform Inscriptions; <ref type="cross" target="crosshieroglyphics">Hieroglyphics</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspersia">Persia</ref>.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—The inscriptions of ancient Greece are more valuable than those of Rome, for the twofold reason that they date much further back in point of time, and because, being usually carved on marble, they have more generally survived the ravages of time than the bronze plates employed by the Romans, which were either melted by various conflagrations that consumed the buildings where they were stored, or else were carried off by invading armies to be made over into coins. There are, however, some inscribed Greek tablets of bronze still surviving, as well as thin plates of lead marked with inscriptions. (See the <title>Archäolog. Zeitung</title> for 1877, p. 196; and id. for 1878, p. 71; Franz, <title>Elementa Epigr. Graecae</title>, p. 168; and Roberts, <title>Greek Epigraphy</title>, pp. 234-242.) One of the Greek bronze plates is represented on the next page. It contains part of a treaty between Oeanthea and Chaleion.</p>
 <p>Immense numbers of inscriptions were set up in ancient times, in all public buildings, in temples and theatres, and by the side of the great roads. Delphi and Olympia abounded in them; while the Parthenon and Acropolis at Athens, the Heraeum at Samos, the Artemisium at Ephesus, and, in fact, all the important sanctuaries, were great storehouses of inscriptions recording laws, decrees, treaties, gifts, arbitrations, and other memorable events of political and religious life. In all, some 30,000 ancient Greek inscriptions are known to scholars.</p>

The alphabet itself is found in inscriptions in the so-called “abecedaria,” of which one of the most interesting is the “Formello Alphabet,” found at Formello near Veii, in Italy, in 1882 by Prince Chigi, and of which a representation is given below. It is the only abecedarium in exist<figure id="fig.00607.2">
<head orig="The Formello Alphabet.">The Formello Alphabet.</head>
</figure> ence which contains the archaic Greek forms of every one of the twenty-two Phoenician letters arranged precisely in the accepted Semitic order. (Cf. Roberts, <title>Greek Epigraphy</title>, p. 20.) It also enables us to determine the alphabetic position and the form of the Greek letter which represents the <hi rend="italic">san (shin)</hi>—i. e. <figure />. (See Kirchhoff, <title>Studien zur Geschichte des griechischen Alphabets</title>, pp. 134 foll.). Other abecedaria are the “Alphabet of Caeré,” on a black vase found in 1836 by Galassi at Cervetri (Kirchhoff, pp. 134 foll.); the “Alphabet of Colle,” found painted on a tomb near Sienna in 1698; the “Cepolla Alphabet,” found near Basta in Calabria by Luigi Cepolla in 1805 (Kirchhoff, p. 157); the “Corinthian Alphabet” (incomplete), on a piece of pottery from Corinth (Kirchhoff, p. 103); and the “Ionic Alphabet,” from a fragment of a marble stelé found by Newton at Calymna (Roberts, p. 19).</p>
 <p>The usual form for the Greek inscribed marbles was the <foreign lang="greek">στήλη</foreign>, a slab from three to five feet high and from three to four inches in thickness, slightly tapering to the top, which was plain or ornamented with a slight moulding. Another form of marble was the <foreign lang="greek">βωμός</foreign>, or altar, square or circular. There are also pillars (<foreign lang="greek">κίονες</foreign>), sarcophagi, statue-bases, and even the walls of the <seg lang="la">cellae</seg> of temples (<title>C. I. G.</title> 2905). Letters cut on walls and <foreign lang="greek">στῆλαι</foreign> were picked out in blue or red pigment.</p>
 <p>The oldest Greek inscriptions yet discovered are from the island of Thera (Santorin) in the Aegean, which are mortuary records, and are by some scholars dated as far back as the tenth century B.C. The oldest, however, to which a definite date can be assigned are found cut on the knee of a colossal <figure id="fig.00607.3"><head>Inscription from a Block of Stone found at Thera. <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπάγατος ἐποίει</foreign>.</head></figure> statue at Abu Simbel in Egypt by Greek mercenaries in the service of Psammetichus, king of Egypt, and hence dating from the end of the seventh or the beginning of the sixth century B.C. Next in order come the <cb /> inscriptions upon the bases of the statues set along the Sacred Way leading to the Temple of Apollo at Branchidae near Miletus, and assigned to the sixth century B.C. An inscription found by Newton at Halicarnassus, and known as the “Lygdamis Inscription,” is of the time of Herodotus (B.C. 453), and is important as exhibiting the Ionic alphabet in almost exactly the form in which it was legally adopted at Athens, fifty years later. A fac-simile of this is given by Roberts in his <title>Greek Epigraphy</title>, p. 175. (See, also, Newton and Pullan, <title>Historical Discoveries at Halicarnassus</title>, etc., pp. 23 foll.). A very interesting Greek inscription is that upon the trophy set up at Delphi by the Greeks to commemorate the Persian defeat at Plataea, and now in the Hippodrome at Constantinople, whither it was brought by Constantine. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna">Columna</ref>.</p>
 <p>Greek inscriptions may be conveniently grouped under the following heads: (1) Historical and Political (<foreign lang="greek">ψηφίσματα, νόμοι</foreign>, treaties, records of awards and arbitrations between rival cities, letters from kings and other rulers, public accounts, lists of treasures, and laudatory inscriptions in honour of individuals);</p>
 <p>(2) Religious (rituals, laws relating to priests, calendars of sacrifices, rules of augury, etc.; prayers and imprecations, leases of sacred lands, oracles, etc.);</p>
 <p>(3) Private (dedications and honourary inscriptions, epitaphs, sepulchral inscriptions, boundary stones of mortgaged lands, inscriptions on statues, etc.). The finest collections of Greek inscribed marbles are those at Athens, London (British Museum), Paris (Louvre), Smyrna, Constantinople, and Oxford.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—The oldest Latin inscriptions do not date from an earlier period than the beginning of the sixth century B.C. The oldest of all is probably the so-called “Fibula Praenestina,” a gold clasp found at Praenesté in 1886, with a short inscription written from right to left. Next in point of time comes the celebrated “Duenos Inscription” (q. v.), written (also from right to left) on three earthen pots, figured on p. 608, and called the “Vascula Dresseliana,” from the archaeologist, Dr. Dressel.</p>
 <p>Other Latin inscriptions of great historical and linguistic interest are those on the tombs of the Scipios, now in the Vatican Library, and other <seg lang="la">tituli sepulcrales</seg>, the Carmen Arvale (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>), the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>, p. 521), and a number of <seg lang="la">leges</seg>, such as the Lex Acilia Repetundarum (<title>C.

 <p>Roman inscriptions are, as a rule, of a much more formal character than the Greek, and are expressed in regular conventional formulae, with abbreviated designations of status for freemen, slaves, children, freedmen, and all the dignities and functions of official, military, and sacerdotal life. Formulaic, also, are the legal inscriptions of all kinds—the <seg lang="la">sortes</seg>, prayers, dedicatory sentences, and execrations—thus exemplifying the methodical and orderly character of the Roman mind. The most important of the epigraphic abbreviations are given in this Dictionary under the different letters of the alphabet. Informal inscriptions, especially the <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> scratched upon the walls and elsewhere, are likewise numerous and valuable, and have a literature of their own. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgraffiti">Graffiti</ref>. The finest collections of Roman inscriptions are at Rome (Vatican, Capitoline Museum, etc.), Naples (Museo Nazionale), London (British Museum), Paris (Louvre), Vienna, and Munich.</p>
 <p>Besides the Latin inscriptions proper, of which some 70,000 are now known, there are dialectic inscriptions in Oscan and Umbrian, and some 6000 in Etruscan. See <ref type="cross" target="crossetruria">Etruria</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossosci">Osci</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstabula-bantina">Tabula Bantina</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstabulae-iguvinae">Tabulae Iguvinae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossumbria">Umbria</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. History of Epigraphy</hi>.—The ancients themselves fully recognized the historical value of inscriptions, so that both orators and historians continually cite them as evidence. (See Demosth. <title>De Falsa Legat.</title> 428; <title>In Ctes.</title> 75; <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 88" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 88</bibl>; v. 58; vii. 228; ix. 81; Thucyd. v. 18; and cf. Eurip. <title>Suppl.</title> 1202 foll.). Regular collections of Greek inscriptions were made by Philochorus (B.C. 300), Polemo (hence called <foreign lang="greek">στηλοκόπας</foreign>), Aristodemus, and others. Cicero, Livy , Pliny the Elder, and Suetonius often cite important inscriptions. As soon as the revival of learning began after the downfall of the Roman Empire, the study of epigraphy commenced—first of the Latin remains by scholars like Poggio Bracciolini and Signorili in the fourteenth century, and then of both Greek and Latin by Cyriacus of Ancona, who copied great numbers of monumental inscriptions, in which he was followed by Marcanova, Felice Feliciano, Ferrarino, Marino Sanudo, and others in the fifteenth century. The first printed collections were published by Spreti <bibl default="NO">(Ravenna, 1489)</bibl>, Peutinger <bibl default="NO">(Augsburg, 1509)</bibl>, Huttich <bibl default="NO">(Mayence, 1520)</bibl>, and Albertini <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1521)</bibl>. Early <seg lang="la">corpora inscriptionum</seg> are those of Apianus <bibl default="NO">(Ingolstadt, 1534)</bibl>, Gruter <bibl default="NO">(1603; re-edited by Graevius, 1707)</bibl>, Gudius (ed. by <bibl default="NO">Hessel, 1731</bibl>), <cb /> Reinesius <bibl default="NO">(1682)</bibl>, Fabretti <bibl default="NO">(1699)</bibl>, Muratori <bibl default="NO">(1739)</bibl>, Maffei <bibl default="NO">(1749)</bibl>, and Donati <bibl default="NO">(1765-75)</bibl>. Among these collections, however, were many inaccurately copied inscriptions and many actual forgeries and falsifications, so that only after critical study and acute investigation could they be used with safety. The sifting of the inscriptions by Maffei, Marini, and others with a view to the detection of falsehood and to scientific research, laid the foundations of critical epigraphy. In 1828, <ref type="cross" target="crossorelli">Orelli</ref> (q.v.) published two volumes of Roman inscriptions embodying the researches of Marini and others, and in the same year August Boeckh published the first volume of the <title>Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum</title>, subsequently augmented by other volumes and by the labours of Franz and Kirchhoff. The publication of these works fixed the methods of epigraphy; and from this time on, numerous epigraphists have devoted themselves to the study of inscriptions and to the working up in monographs of the results obtained in their investigations. The great <title>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</title> was projected as early as 1732 by Maffei, but was not actually begun until the work had been taken up by the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin. The first volume (<title>Inscriptiones Antiquissimae ad C. Caesaris Mortem</title>) appeared in 1863, containing also the <title>Fasti Consulares</title> and indices. Up to 1895, fifteen volumes had appeared under the editorship of Mommsen, Henzen, De Rossi, Hübner, Ritschl, Zangemeister, Wilmanns, Hirschfeld, Dessan, and others. The arrangement adopted is the geographical.</p>
 <p>Of late, great attention to the study of inscriptions has been given by students of the dialects, especially the dialects of Greece, as the information which the epigraphic remains afford is much more reliable than that derived from literature with its conventional and frequently artificial language.

<div2 id="crossepimenides" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epimenĭdes">Epimenides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπιμενίδης</foreign>). A Cretan, contemporary with Solon, and born perhaps in B.C. 659, at Phaestus, in the island of Crete, according to some accounts, or at Cnosus according to others. Many marvellous tales are related of him. It is said that, going by his father's order in search of a sheep, he laid himself down in a cave, where he fell asleep and slept for fifty years, on which legend Goethe has written a poem. He then made his appearance among his fellow-citizens with long hair and a flowing beard, and with a knowledge of medicine and natural history which then appeared more than human. Another story told of this Cretan was that he had the power of sending his soul out of his body and recalling it at pleasure; that he had familiar intercourse with the gods, and possessed the power of prophecy. The event of his life by which he is best known was his visit to Athens at the request of the inhabitants, in order to pave the way for the legislation of Solon by purifications and propitiatory sacrifices. These rites were intended, according to the spirit of the age, to allay the feuds and party dissensions which prevailed there; and, although what he enjoined was mostly of a religious nature (for instance, the sacrifice of a human victim, the consecration of a temple to the Eumenides, and of two altars to Hybris and Anaidea, the two evil powers which were exerting their influence on the Athenians), there can be little doubt that his object was political, and that Solon's constitution would hardly have been accepted had it not been recommended and sanctioned by some person who, like Epimenides, claimed from men little less than the veneration due to a superior being. The Athenians wished to reward Epimenides with wealth and public honours, but he refused to accept any remuneration, and demanded only a branch of the sacred olive-tree and a decree of perpetual friendship between Athens and his native city. Epimenides is said to have lived, after his return to Crete, to the age of 157 years. Other accounts give his age as nearly 230 years. Divine honours were paid him by the Cretans after his death.</p>
 <p>Epimenides composed a theogony and other poems concerning religious mysteries. He wrote also a poem on the Argonautic Expedition, and other works, which are entirely lost. His treatise on oracles and responses, mentioned by St. Jerome, is said to have been the work from which St. Paul quotes in the epistle to Titus (i. 12). See Diog. Laert. i. 109; Val. Max. viii. 13.

<div2 id="crossepiphanius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Epiphanius">Epiphanius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐπιφάνιος</foreign>). A bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, in the fourth century. He was born of Jewish parents, near Eleutheropolis, in Palestine, about A.D. 320, and appears to have been educated in Egypt, where he imbibed the principles of the Gnostics. At length he left them, and, becoming an ascetic, returned to Palestine and adopted the discipline of St. Hilarion, the founder of monachism in that country. Epiphanius erected a monastery near the place of his birth, over which he presided till he was made bishop of Salamis in 367. Here he remained about thirty-six years, and composed most of his writings. In 391 he commenced a controversy with John, bishop of Jerusalem, relative to the Platonic doctrines of the learned and laborious Origen, against which he wrote and preached with implacable bitterness. John favoured Origen's views, but Epiphanius found in Theophilus, the violent bishop of Alexandria, a worthy coadjutor, who, in 399, convened a council and condemned all the works of Origen. Epiphanius himself then called a council in Cyprus, A.D. 401, and reiterated this condemnation. Afterwards, he embroiled himself with the empress Eudoxia; for on the occasion of her asking him to pray for the young Theodosius, who was dangerously ill, he replied that her son should live provided she would disavow the defenders of Origen. To this presumptuous message the empress indignantly answered that her son's life was not in the power of Epiphanius, whose prayers were unable to save that of his own archdeacon who had recently died. After thus vainly endeavouring to gratify his sectarian animosity, he resolved to return to Cyprus; but he died at sea on the passage, A.D. 403. The principal works of Epiphanius are: (1) <foreign lang="greek">Πανάριον</foreign>, or a Treatise on Heresies—that is, peculiar sects (<foreign lang="greek">αἱρέσεις</foreign>). This is the most important of his writings and treats of eighty sects, from the time of Adam to the latter part of the fourth century.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</foreign>, or an Epitome of the Panarion.</p>
 <p>(3) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀγκυρωτόν</foreign>, or a Discourse on the Faith, explaining the doctrine of the Trinity, Resurrection, etc.</p>
 <p>(4) A treatise on the ancient weights, measures, and coins of the Jews. St. Jerome admires Epiphanius for his skill in the Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin languages, and styles him “Pentaglottus” (<foreign lang="greek">Πεντάγλωττος</foreign>), or the Five-tongued. His writings are of great value, as containing numerous citations from curious works which are no longer extant. See the monograph by Lipsius <bibl default="NO">(Vienna, 1865)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἤπειρος</foreign>). A country to the west of Thessaly, lying along the Adriatic. The Greek term, which answers to the English word <hi rend="italic">mainland</hi>, appears to have been applied at a very early period to that northwestern portion of Greece <cb /> which is situated between the chain of Pindus and the Ionian Gulf and between the Ceraunian Mountains and the river Acheloüs—this name being probably used to distinguish it from the large, populous, and wealthy island of Corcyra, which lay opposite to the coast. It appears that, in very ancient times, Acarnania was also included in the term, and in that case the name must have been used in opposition to all the islands lying along the coast ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 14. 100" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>xiv. 100</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The inhabitants of Epirus were scarcely considered Hellenic. The population in early times had been Pelasgic. The oracle at Dodona was always called Pelasgic, and many names of places in Epirus were also borne by the Pelasgic cities of the opposite coast of Italy. But irruptions of Illyrians had barbarized the whole nation; and though Herodotus speaks of Thesprotia as a part of Hellas, he refers rather to its old condition, when it was a celebrated seat of the Pelasgians, than to its state at the time when he wrote his history. In their mode of cutting the hair, in their costume, and in their language, the Epirotes resembled the Macedonians, who were an Illyrian race. Theopompus, cited by Strabo, divided the inhabitants of Epirus into fourteen different tribes, of which the most renowned were the Chaonians, Thesprotians, and Molossians. The Molossians claimed descent from Molossus, son of Neoptolemus and Andromaché. Tradition reported that the son of Achilles, Neoptolemus or Pyrrhus, as he is also called, having crossed from Thessaly into Epirus on his return from the siege of Troy, was induced, by the advice of an oracle, to settle in the latter country, where, having subjugated a considerable extent of territory, he transmitted his newly formed kingdom to Molossus, his son by Andromaché, from whom his subjects derived the name of Molossi.</p>
 <p>The history of Molossia is involved in great obscurity until the period of the Persian invasion, when the name of Admetus, king of the Molossi, occurs from the circumstance of his having generously afforded shelter to Themistocles when in exile and pursued by his enemies, although the influence of that celebrated statesman had previously been exerted against him in some negotiations which he had carried on at Athens ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 136" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 136</bibl>). Admetus was succeeded by his son Tharybas or Tharymbas, who appears to have been a minor towards the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, when we find his subjects assisting the Ambraciots in their invasion of Acarnania. Tharybas is represented by Plutarch ( <title>Pyrrh.</title>) as a wise and able monarch, and as encouraging science and literature. His successor is not known; but some years after, we hear of a prince called Alcetas, who was dethroned by his subjects but restored by Dionysius of Syracuse (Pausan. i. 11). Neoptolemus, his son, reigned but for a short time and left the crown to his brother Arybas, together with the care of his children. Alexander, the eldest of these, succeeded his uncle, and was the first sovereign of Epirus who raised the character and fame of that country among foreign nations by his talents and valour. His sister Olympias had been married to Philip of Macedon before his accession to the throne of Epirus, and the friendship thus cemented between the two monarchs was still further strengthened by the union of Alexander with Cleopatra , the daughter of Philip. It was during the celebration of their nuptials at Edessa 
<pb n="611" /><cb />
 that the king of Macedon was assassinated. Alexander of Epirus seems to have been an ambitious prince, desirous of conquest and renown. There is good reason for believing that he united the Chaonians, Thesprotians, and other Epirotic clans, together with the Molossians, under his sway, as we find the title of king of Epirus first assumed by him ( <bibl n="Diod.  16. 72" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xvi. 72</bibl>). Having been applied to by the Tarentines to aid them against the attacks of the Lucani and Bruttii, he eagerly seized this opportunity of adding to his fame and enlarging his dominions. He therefore crossed over into Italy with a considerable force, and, had he been properly seconded by the Tarentines and the other colonies of Magna Graecia, the barbarians, after being defeated in several engagements, must have been conquered. But Alexander, being left to his own resources and exertions, was at length surrounded by the enemy and slain (B.C. 326) near Pandosia in the Bruttian territory (<bibl n="Liv.  8. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, viii. 24</bibl>). On the death of Alexander the crown devolved on his cousin Aeacides, the son of Arybas, the former king, of whom little is known, except that, having raised an army to assist Olympias against Cassander, his soldiers mutinied and deposed him; not long after, however, he appears to have been reinstated. His brother Alcetas, who succeeded him, was engaged in a war with Cassander, which proved disastrous; for, being defeated, his dominions were overrun by the forces of his victorious enemy, and he himself was put to death by his rebellious subjects. The name of Pyrrhus, who now ascended the throne, gives to the history of Epirus an importance it never would otherwise have possessed. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspyrrhus">Pyrrhus</ref>.) Alexander, the eldest son of Pyrrhus, succeeded his father, whom he sought to emulate by attempting afresh the conquest of Macedon. On this occasion Antigonus Gonatas was again vanquished and driven from his dominions. But Demetrius, his son, having raised another army, attacked Alexander and presently compelled him to evacuate the Macedonian territory ( <bibl n="Just.  26. 3" default="NO">Just.xxvi. 3</bibl>). At the expiration of two other insignificant reigns, the royal line of the Aeacidae becoming extinct, the Epirots determined to adopt a republican form of government, which prevailed until the subjugation of Macedon by the Romans. Having been accused of favouring Perseus in the last Macedonian War, they became the objects of the bitterest vengeance of the Romans, who treated them with unusual severity. Aemilius Paullus destroyed seventy of their towns and sold 150,000 of the inhabitants into slavery. Epirus, having lost its independence, was then annexed as a province to the Roman Empire. See Merleker, <bibl default="NO"><title>Darstellung des Landes und der Berwohner von Epeiros</title> (Königsberg, 1841)</bibl>; and Bowen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Athos, Thessaly, and Epirus</title> (London, 1852)</bibl>.

Letters usually had prefixed to them the name of the sender and the person addressed, and were not signed at the end. The following are some of the usual forms: <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cicero Varroni</hi> (Cicero to Varro); <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cicero Dolabellae S</hi>. (Cicero to Dolabella, greeting); <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cicero Planco D</hi>. (Cicero to Plancus gives greeting); <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cicero Imp.

D. <seg lang="la">salutem dicit;</seg> and S. P. D. for <seg lang="la">salutem plurimam dicit.</seg> Formulas of courtesy that often begin letters are the following: V. E.

(<seg lang="la">si vos exercitusque valetis bene est; ego quoque valeo</seg>), etc. Phrases of courtesy or affection at the end of a letter are the following: <title>Vale.—Cura ut valeas.— Da operam ut valeas.—Fac ut diligentissime te ipsum custodias.—Cura ut valeas et me, ut amas, ama.— Cura ut valeas et nos ames et tibi persuadeas te a me fraterne amari.—Vale et nos dilige.—Bene vale et me dilige.—Fac valeas meque ames.—Tu, ut instituisti, me diligas rogo, proprieque tuum esse tibi persuadeas. — Fac valeas meque mutuo diligas.—Etiam atque etiam vale.</title></p>
 <p>The date and place, if written at all, are given at the end of the letter. Thus: <title>Data pr. Kal. Mai. Brundisii.—Hoc ex Nicia</title>, etc.</p>
 <p>The epistle plays an important part in ancient as in modern literature, though in classical Greek literature the number of genuine letters is small. The collection attributed to Plato, though highly interesting and regarded by Grote as authentic, is rejected by recent scholarship; and so the letters ascribed to Demosthenes, to Aeschines, and to Xenophon. The nine that bear the name of Isocrates are universally accepted as his. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossisocrates">Isocrates</ref>.) Three letters of Epicurus are preserved by Diogenes Laertius. Specimens of the official epistle are to be seen in the oration of Demosthenes on the Crown. Much valuable information on the history of the times is gathered from the later Greek letters of Gregory Nanzianzenus, Basil, Chrysostom, and other ecclesiastical writers.</p>
 <p>Letter writing was from an early period cultivated 
<pb n="612" /><cb /> among the Romans, and both official and personal letters of eminent men soon began to be collected, such as the letters of the elder Cato to his son, and of Cornelia to C. Gracchus. At a later period, those of Caesar, Brutus, and especially of Cicero, were preserved. Most of the Roman letters remaining to us are not the genuine private correspondence of their authors, but were from the first written with an eye to publication, like the priggish and self-conscious epistles of the younger Pliny. The most valuable correspondence ever preserved is that of Cicero, whose letters to the number of nearly one thousand were published by his amanuensis, <ref type="cross" target="crosstiro">Tiro</ref> (q.v.). These are the familiar effusions of the orator, written with no view to publication, and are invaluable for the light they throw upon the personality of the writer and the history of his times. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscicero">Cicero</ref>.</p>
 <p>Examples of letters in historical works are those in Antipater, Quadrigarius, and especially in Sallust. The epistolary form was also used by the jurists for their <seg lang="la">responsa</seg> on questions of law; by scholars for their learned discussions (e. g. Verrius Flaccus, Lactantius, etc.); by physicians for medical expositions (e. g. Marcellus Empiricus and Oribasius); and by the rhetoricians of the imperial age as a form of stylistic exercise. (See Teuffel, <title>Hist. of Rom. Lit.</title>, Eng. trans., i. pp. 73-76). Next to the letters of Cicero, those of Pliny the Younger are most read. Other important letterwriters are Seneca, Fronto, Symmachus, Sidonius, and still later Salvianus, Ruricius, Ennodius, Lactantius, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Cassiodorus. Specimens of Vergil's correspondence are given by Macrobius (i. 24, 11).</p>
 <p>The poetical epistle was cultivated as early as B.C. 146 by Sp. Mummius, who, when in camp before Corinth, addressed satirical letters in verse to friends at Rome ( <title>Ad Att.</title> xiii. 6, 4). Several of the satires of Lucilius were composed in the form of letters, and the poem of Catullus to Manlius (<bibl n="Catul. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">68 A</bibl>) is in the epistolary form. The most successful in this department of literature were Horace in his two books of <title>Epistolae</title> and Ovid in the imaginary love-letters (<title>Heroides</title>) and in his own genuine lamentations from exile (<title>Tristia</title> and the <title>Epistolae ex Ponto</title>). Statius, Ausonius, and Claudianus are later examples of the poetical epistolographer.</p>
 <p>Forged letters are frequently found in Latin literature. Instances are the <title>Epistulae Medicinales</title> professedly from Hippocrates to Maecenas, and the celebrated fourteen letters which form the alleged correspondence between Seneca and St. Paul, which were, however, accepted as genuine by St. Jerome (<title>De Vir. Illust.</title> 12), and by St. Augustine (<title>Epist.</title> 153). On these see Fleury, <bibl default="NO"><title>St. Paul et Sénèque</title> (Paris, 1853)</bibl>; Lightfoot, <title>St. Paul's Epist. to the Philippians</title>, p. 260 <bibl default="NO">(London, 1868)</bibl>; and Aubertin, <bibl default="NO"><title>Sénèque et St. Paul</title> (Paris, 1869)</bibl>.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔπος</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>.—Many indications point to the fact that the oldest poetry of the Greeks was connected with the worship of the gods, and that religious poetry of a mystical kind was composed by the priests of the Thracians, a musical and poetical people, and diffused in old times through Northern Greece. The worship of the Muses was thus derived from the Thracians, who in later times had disappeared from Greece Proper; and accordingly the oldest bards whose names are known to the Greeks— Orpheus, Musaeus, Eumolpus, Thamyris—are supposed to have been Thracians also. The current ideas of the nature and action of the gods tended more and more to take the form of poetical myths respecting their birth, actions, and sufferings. Hence, these compositions, of which an idea may be derived from some of the so-called Homeric Hymns, gradually assumed an epic character. In course of time the epic writers threw off their connection with religion, and struck out on independent lines. Confining themselves no longer to the myths about the gods, they celebrated the heroic deeds both of mythical antiquity and of the immediate past. Thus, in the Homeric descriptions of the epic age, while the bards Phemius and Demodocus appear as favourites of the gods, to whom they are indebted for the gift of song, they are not attached to any particular worship. The subjects of their song are not only stories about the gods, such as the loves of Ares and Aphrodité, but the events of recent times, the conquest of Troy by means of the wooden horse, and the tragic return of the Achaeans from Troy. Singers like these, appearing at public festivals, and at the tables of princes, to entertain the guests with their lays, must have existed early in Greece Proper. It was, however, the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor who first fully developed the capacities of epic poetry. By long practice, extending probably through centuries, a gradual progress was probably effected from short lays to long epic narratives; and at the same time a tradition delivered from master to scholar handed on and perfected the outer form of style and metre. Thus, about B.C. 900, epic poetry was brought to its highest perfection by the genius of Homer, the reputed author of the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title> After Homer it sank, never to rise again, from the height to which he had raised it. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>. 
<pb n="614" /><cb /></p>
 <p>It is true that in the following centuries a series of epics, more or less comprehensive, were composed by poets of the Ionic school in close imitation of the style and metre of Homer. But not one of them succeeded in coming even within measurable distance of their great master. The favourite topics of these writers were such fables as served either to introduce, or to extend and continue, the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title> They were called Cyclic Poets perhaps because the most important of their works were afterwards put together with the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> in an epic cycle, or circle of lays. The Cyprian poems (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Κύπρια</foreign>), of Stasinus of Salamis in Cyprus (B.C. 776), formed the introduction to the <title>Iliad.</title> These embraced the history of the period between the marriage of Peleus and the opening of the <title>Iliad.</title> At about the same time Arctinus of Miletus composed his <title>Aethiopis</title> in five books. This poem started from the conclusion of the <title>Iliad</title>, and described the death of Achilles, and of the Ethiopian prince Memnon, the contest for the arms of Achilles, and the suicide of Aias. The <title>Destruction of Ilium</title>, by the same author, was in two books. By way of supplement to the Homeric <title>Iliad</title>, Lesches of Mitylené, either about B.C. 708 or 664, wrote a <title>Little Iliad</title>, in four books. This embraced the contest for the arms of Achilles, the appearance of Neoptolemus and Philoctetes, and the capture of the city. The transition from the <title>Iliad</title> to the <title>Odyssey</title> was formed by the five books of <foreign lang="greek">Νόστοι</foreign> (<title>The Return of the Heroes</title>), written by Agias of Troezen. The <title>Telegonia</title>, by Eugammon of Cyrené (about 570), continued the <title>Odyssey.</title> This was in two books, embracing the history of Odysseus from the burial of the suitors until his death at the hands of his son Telegonus. These poems and those of the other cyclics were, after Homer, the sources from which the later lyric and dramatic poets drew most of their information. But only fragments of them remain. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclic-poets">Cyclic Poets</ref>.</p>
 <p>A new direction was given to epic poetry in Greece Proper by the didactic and genealogical poems of Hesiod of Ascra, about a hundred years after Homer. Hesiod was the founder of a school, the productions of which were often attributed to him as those of the Ionic school were to Homer. One of these disciples of Hesiod was Eumelus of Corinth (about B.C. 750), of the noble family of the Bacchiadae. But his poems, like those of the rest, are lost. See <ref type="cross" target="crosshesiodus">Hesiodus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The most notable representatives of mythical epic poetry in the following centuries are Pisander of Camirus (about B.C. 640), and Panyasis of Halicarnassus (during the first half of the fifth century). In the second half of the fifth century Choerilus of Samos wrote a <title>Perseïs</title> on the Persian Wars, the first attempt in Greece at an historical epic. His younger contemporary, Antimachus of Colophon, also struck out a new line in his learned <title>Thebaïs</title>, the precursor and model of the later epic of Alexandria. The Alexandrians laid great stress on learning and artistic execution in detail, but usually confined themselves to poems of less magnitude. The chief representatives of the Alexandrian school are Callimachus (about B.C. 250), Rhianus, Euphorion, and Apollonius of Rhodes. The last made a futile attempt to return to the simplicity of Homer. His <title>Argonautica</title> is, with the exception of the Homeric poems, the only Greek epic which has survived from the ante-Christian era. <cb /> In the 200 years between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D., the mythical epic is represented by Quintus Smyrnaeus, Nonnus, Colluthus, Tryphiodorus, Musaeus, and the apocryphal Orpheus. Nonnus, Colluthus, and Tryphiodorus were Egyptians. Nonnus and Musaeus, alone among these writers, have any claim to distinction. The talent of Nonnus is genuine, but undisciplined; Musaeus knows how to throw a charm into his treatment of a narrow subject. The whole series is closed by the <title>Iliaca</title> of Joannes Tzetzes, a learned but tasteless scholar of the twelfth century A.D. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstzetzes">Tzetzes</ref>.</p>
 <p>As Homer was the master of the mythical, so Hesiod was the master of the didactic epic. After him this department of poetry was best represented by Xenophanes of Colophon, Parmenides of Elea, and Empedocles of Agrigentium, in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. In the Alexandrian period, didactic poetry was much taken up, and employed upon the greatest possible variety of subjects. But none of its representatives succeeded in writing more than poetic prose, or in handling their intractable material with the mastery which Vergil shows in his Georgics. The period produced the astronomical epic of Aratus of Sicyon (about B.C. 275), and two medical poems by Nicander of Colophon (about 150). Under the Roman Empire more didactic poetry was produced by the Greek writers. Maximus and the so-called Manetho wrote on astrology. Dionysius Periegetes on geography, Oppian on angling, and an imitator of Oppian on hunting. The Alexandrian period also produced didactic poems in iambic senarii, as, e. g., several on geography bearing the names of Dicaearchus and Scymnus, which still survive.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>.—The Romans possibly had songs of an epic character from the earliest times; but these were soon forgotten. They had, however, a certain influence on the later and comparatively artificial literature, for both Livius Andronicus in his translation of the <title>Odyssey</title>, and Naevius in his <title>Punic War</title>, wrote in the traditional Italian metre, the <title>versus Saturnius.</title> Naevius was, it is true, a national poet, and so was his successor Ennius, but the latter employed the Greek hexameter metre, instead of the rude Saturnian. To follow the example of Ennius, and celebrate the achievements of their countrymen in the form of the Greek epic, was the ambition of several poets before the fall of the Republic. A succession of poets, as Hostius, the tragedian Attius, and Furius were the authors of poetical annals. Here it is proper also to mention cicero's epics on Marius and on his own consulship, besides the poem of Terentius Varro of Atax (Atacinus) on Caesar's war with the Sequani (<title>Bellum Sequanicum</title>). Latin epics on Greek mythical subjects seem to have been rare in the republican age. At least we know of only a few translations, as that of the <title>Iliad</title> by Mattius and Ninnius Crassus, and of the <title>Cypria</title> by Laevinus. Toward the end of the republican age it was a favourite form of literary activity to write in free imitation of the learned Alexandrians. Varro of Atax, for example, followed Apollonius of Rhodes in his <title>Argonautica;</title> others, like Helvius Cinna and the orator Licinius Calvus, preferred the shorter epics so much in favour with the Alexandrians. Only one example in this style is completely preserved, the quasi epithalamium (lxiv.) of Catullus. This is the only example we possess of the narrative epic of the Republic.
 
<pb n="615" /><cb /></p>
 <p>But in the Augustan Age both kinds of epic, the mythic and the historical, are represented by a number of poets. Varius Rufus, Rabirius, Cornelius Severus, and Pedo Albinovanus treated contemporary history in the epic style; Domitius Marsus and Macer turned their attention to the mythology. The <title>Aeneid</title> of Vergil, the noblest monument of Roman epic poetry, combines both characters. Of all the epic productions of this age, the only ones which are preserved intact are the <title>Aeneid</title>, a panegyric on Messala, which found its way into the poems of Tibullus, and perhaps two poems, the  <title>Culex</title>and <title>Ciris</title>, both often attributed to Vergil. See <ref type="cross" target="crossvergilius-maro">Vergilius</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the first century A.D. we have several examples of the historical epic: the <title>Pharsalia</title> of Lucan, the <title>Punica</title> of Silius Italicus, a <title>Bellum Civile</title> in the satirical romance of Petronius, and an anonymous panegyric on Calpurnius Piso, who was executed for conspiracy under Nero, A.D. 65. The heroic style is represented by the <title>Argonautica</title> of Valerius Flaccus, and the <title>Thebaïs</title> and <title>Achilleïs</title> of Statius, to which we may add the metrical epitome of the <title>Iliad</title> by the so-called Pindarus Thebanus. The politico-historical poems of the succeeding centuries, by Publius Porfirius Optatianus in the fourth century, Claudianus, Merobaudes, Sidonius Apollinaris in the fifth, Priscian, Corippus, and Venantius Fortunatus in the sixth, are entirely panegyric in character, and intended to do homage to the emperor or men of influence. Of all these poets, Claudianus is the most important. He and Dracontius (towards the end of the fifth century) are among the last who take their subjects from mythology.</p>
 <p>Didactic poetry, which suited the serious character of the Romans, was early represented at Rome. In this the Romans were in many ways superior to the Greeks. Appius Claudius Caecus and the elder Cato were authors of gnomic poetry. Ennius, the tragedian Attius, and several of his contemporaries wrote didactic pieces; the satires of Lucilius and Varro were also in part didactic. It was, however, not till the end of the republican period that the influence of Greek literature gave predominance to the Greek epic form. It was then adopted by Varro of Atax, by M. Cicero, and above all by Lucretius, whose philosophical poem <title>De Rerum Natura</title> is the only didactic poem of this period that has been preserved intact, as it is one of the most splendid monuments of Roman genius. In the Augustan Age many writers were active in this field. Valgius Rufus and Aemilius Macer followed closely in the steps of the Alexandrians. Grattius wrote a poem on hunting, a part of which still survives; Manilius, an astronomical poem which survives entire. But the <title>Georgics</title> of Vergil throw all similar work, Greek or Latin, into the shade. Ovid employs the epic metre in his <title>Metamorphoses</title> and <title>Halieutica</title>, the elegiac in his <title>Fasti.</title></p>
 <p>In the first century A.D. Germanicus translated Aratus. Columella wrote a poem on gardening; an unknown author (often called Lucilius), the <title>Aetna.</title> The third century produced the medical poem of Sammonicus Serenus, and that of Nemesianus on hunting. In the fourth we have Ausonius, much of whose work is didactic; Palladius on agriculture; an adaptation of Aratus and of <cb /> Dionysius Periegetes by Avienus, with a description of the sea-coasts of the known world in iambics; in the fifth, besides some of Claudianus's pieces, a description by Rutilius Namatianus in elegiacs of his return home. The book of Dionysius Periegetes was adapted by Priscian in the sixth century. A collection of proverbs, bearing the name of Cato , belongs to the fourth century. In most of these compositions the metrical form is a mere set off; and in the school verses of the grammarians, as in those by Terentianus Maurus on metres, and in those by an anonymous author on rhetorical figures, and on weights and measures, there is no pretence of poetry at all.</p>

<head orig="Equĭtes">Equites</head>

 <p> (horsemen or knights). The <seg lang="la">equites</seg> were originally a real division of the Roman army. At the beginning of the kingly period they were called Celeres, and their number is said to have been 300, chosen in equal parts from the three tribes of the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstribus">Tribus</ref>.) A hundred formed a <seg lang="la">centuria</seg>, each <seg lang="la">centuria</seg> being named after the tribe from which it was taken. Thirty made a <seg lang="la">turma</seg>, and ten were under the command of a <seg lang="la">decurio</seg> (q. v.), while the whole corps was commanded by the <seg lang="la">tribunus celerum.</seg> During the course of the kingly period the body of equites was increased to sixteen <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg>, and the constitution of Servius Tullius finally raised it to eighteen. When the twelve new centuries were formed, consisting of the richest persons in the State, whose income exceeded that of the first class in the census, the corps of equites lost the exclusively patrician character which had hitherto distinguished it. At the same time its military importance was diminished, as it no longer formed the first rank, but took up a position on the wings of the phalanx. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossexercitus">Exercitus</ref>.) The equites, however, retained both in the State and in the army their personal prestige. In the Comitia they voted first, and in <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg> of their own. They were the most distinguished troops in the army. No other soldiers were in a position to keep two horses and a groom apiece, a costly luxury, although they received an allowance for the purchase and keep of their horse. After the introduction of the pay system they received three times as much as the ordinary troops; on occasion of a triumph three times the ordinary share of booty; and at the foundation of a colony a much larger allotment than the ordinary colonist. The 1800 <seg lang="la">equites equo publico</seg>, or equites whose horses were purchased and kept by the State, were chosen every five years, at the census. The election was carried out in the republican period originally by the consuls, but in later times by the censors. After the general census was completed, the censors proceeded to review the equites (<seg lang="la">recognitio</seg>). They were arranged according to their tribes, and each of them, leading his horse by the hand, passed before the tribunal of the censors in the Forum. All who had served their time, and who were physically incapacitated, received their discharge. If an eques were judged unworthy of his position, he was dismissed with the words, “Sell your horse” (<title>Vende equum</title>). If there were nothing against him, he was passed on with the words <title>Traduc equum</title> (“Lead your horse past”). The vacancies were then filled up with suitable candidates, and the new list (<seg lang="la">album equitum</seg>) read aloud. In later times, the eques whose name was first read out was called <seg lang="la">princeps iuventutis.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossprinceps">Princeps</ref>.</p>
 <p>During their time of service (between the ages <cb /> of 17 and 46) the equites were bound to serve in a number of campaigns not exceeding ten. When their service expired, they passed into the first censorial class. The senators alone among the equites were, in earlier times, allowed to keep their <seg lang="la">equus publicus</seg>, their name on the roll, and their rights as equites unimpaired. But of this privilege the senators were deprived in the time of the Gracchi. The <figure id="fig.00616">
<head orig="Representation of the Ceremony of Transvectio on Roman Censorial Coins. (Spanheim.)">Representation of the Ceremony of Transvectio on Roman Censorial Coins. (Spanheim.)</head>
</figure> number of the <seg lang="la">equites equo publico</seg> remained the same, as no addition was made to the sum expended by the State on the horses. Young men of property sometimes served on their own horses (<seg lang="la">equo privato</seg>) without any share in the political privileges of the equites. After the Second Punic War the body of equites gradually lost its military position, and finally ceased to exist as a special troop. In the first century B.C. the members of the equestrian <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg> only served in the <seg lang="la">cohors praetoria</seg> of the general, or in the capacity of military tribunes and <seg lang="la">praefecti</seg> of cohorts.</p>
 <p>The wealthy class, who were in possession of the large capital which enabled them to undertake the farming of the public revenues, and who consequently had the opportunity of enriching themselves still further, had long enjoyed a very influential position. In B.C. 123 the <seg lang="la">lex iudiciaria</seg> of Gaius Gracchus transferred to the possessors of the equestrian census (400,000 sestertii, or about $17,000) the right to sit on juries, which had previously belonged exclusively to members of the Senate. Thus an <seg lang="la">ordo equester</seg>, or third order, standing between the Senate and the people, was formed, which began to play an important part in politics. Its members were called equites even if they were not enrolled in the <seg lang="la">centuriae equitum.</seg> The contests between the Senate and the equites for the exclusive right to sit on the juries continued with varying fortunes until the end of the Republic. Augustus allowed the <seg lang="la">ordo equester</seg> to continue in existence as a class in possession of a certain income; but the old fiscal and judicial system came to an end, and the <seg lang="la">ordo</seg> accordingly lost all its former importance. On the other hand, the equites proper rose into a position of great consideration. They were divided into six <seg lang="la">turmae</seg>, headed by an imperial prince as <seg lang="la">princeps iuventutis.</seg> True, they had no further standing as a corporation; but the emperor employed them in a variety of confidential posts. The title <seg lang="la">eques equo publico</seg> was necessary for the attainment 
<pb n="617" /><cb /> of the office of military tribune, and for a number of the most important military posts. The power of conferring or withdrawing the title came at length to rest with the emperor alone. The review of the equites, which used to take place every five years, now became a mere ceremony, and was united by Augustus with the ancient annual parade (<seg lang="la">transvectio</seg>) of the 15th of July. The equites, in full uniform, rode through the Fórum to the Capitol, past the Temple of Mars or Honos.</p>
 <p>After the transference of the seat of government to Constantinople, the <seg lang="la">turmae equitum</seg> sank into the position of a city corporation, standing between the Senate and the guilds, and in possession of special privileges. The insignia of the equites were a gold ring and a narrow purple border on the tunic. (See Clavus Angustus; <ref type="cross" target="crossius-anuli-aurei">Ius Anuli Aurei</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstunica">Tunica</ref>.) At the <seg lang="la">transvectio</seg> they wore the <seg lang="la">trabea</seg>, a mantle adorned with purple stripes, and crowns of olive. After B.C. 67 the first fourteen rows in the theatre were assigned to them.</p>

The Greek term for an organized club or society, for the purposes of feasting and amusement, whose members were called <foreign lang="greek">ἐρανισταί</foreign>. Sometimes it would be formed in connection with the worship of particular deities. Sometimes, again, the object of an <foreign lang="greek">ἔρανος</foreign> would be mutual assistance by advances of money. The government encouraged these clubs, because their corporate character made it easier to settle with expedition any legal proceedings arising out of their affairs. Trials of this kind, for refusal to pay subscriptions, or to repay loans, had to be settled within a month. See Becker-Göll, <title>Charikles</title>, ii. pp. 296 foll.

<head orig="Erasistrătus">Erasistratus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐρασίστρατος</foreign>). A physician of Iulis, in the island of Ceos, and grandson of Aristotle by a daughter of this philosopher. After having frequented the schools of Chrysippus, Metrodorus, and Theophrastus, he passed some time at the court of Seleucus Nicator, where he gained great reputation by discovering the secret malady which preyed upon the young Antiochus, the son of the king, who was in love with his stepmother, Queen Stratonicé (Appian. <title>Bell. Syr.</title> 59). It was at Alexandria, however, that he principally practised. At last he refused altogether to visit the sick, and devoted himself entirely to the study of anatomy. The branches of this study which are indebted to him for new discoveries are, among others, the doctrine of the functions of the brain and that of the nervous system. He immortalized himself by the discovery of the <seg lang="la">viae lacteae;</seg> and he would seem to have come very near to that of the circulation of the blood. Comparative anatomy furnished him with the means of describing the brain much better than had ever been done before him. He also distinguished and gave names to the auricles of the heart (Galen, <title>De Dogm. Hipp. et Plat.</title> vii.; <title>De Usu Part.</title> viii.; <title>De Administr. Anat.</title> vii.; <title>An Sanguis</title>, etc.). A singular doctrine of Erasistratus is that of the <foreign lang="greek">πνεῦμα</foreign>, or the spiritual substance which, according to him, fills the arteries, which we inhale in respiration, which from the lungs makes its way into the arteries, and then becomes the vital principle of the human system. As long as this spirit moves about in the arteries, and the blood in the veins, man enjoys health; but when, from some cause or other, the veins become contracted, the blood then spreads into the arteries and becomes the source of maladies; it produces fever when it enters into some noble part or into the great artery, and inflammations when it is found in the less noble parts or in the extremities of the arteries. Erasistratus rejected entirely blood-letting, as well as cathartics; he supplied their place with dieting, tepid bathing, vomiting, and exercise. In general, he was attached to simple remedies; he recognized what was subsequently termed <hi rend="italic">idiosyncrasy</hi>, or the peculiar constitution of different individuals, which makes the same remedy act differently on different persons. A few fragments of the writings of Erasistratus have been preserved by Galen.

 <head><surname full="yes">Erasmus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Desiderius</foreName>
 <p>(the pseudo-classical form of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Geert Geert's</hi>), was born at Rotterdam, October 27, 1466 or 1467, of illegitimate birth. His father is the hero of Charles Reade's remarkable historical novel, <title>The Cloister and the Hearth.</title> Erasmus as a child studied at Gouda, Utrecht, and finally under Alexander Hegius at Deventer. When older he lived successively at Bois-le-Duc, the Augustinian College at Delft, and at the Collège Montaigu in Paris, of which latter residence he says in his <title>Colloquia</title>, “From it I carried away nothing but a body infected by disease and a plentiful supply of vermin.” About 1487 he was ordained priest by the Bishop of Utrecht. Being in great need of money he took pupils, and with one of these, Lord Mountjoy, he visited England in 1497, spending some time at Oxford and making the acquaintance of such distinguished Englishmen 
<pb n="618" /><cb /> as Colet, Grocyn, Latimer, and Linacre, and afterwards of Warham and Sir Thomas More. From 1499 to 1506 he travelled extensively, visiting Paris, Orléans, St. Omer's, Louvain, and Brussels, where in 1504 he delivered a Latin oration before the Archduke Philip. In 1506 he again visited England, where he entered himself at Cambridge for the B.D. and D.D. degrees, the first of which he soon received. In the same year he travelled in Italy and received a papal dispensation allowing him to lay aside the priestly dress. In Venice he met the great scholars Mersurus, Alexander, Baptista Egnatius, and the others whose works were then issuing from the presses of Aldus. In Padua he became tutor to the natural son of James IV. of Scotland. Erasmus remained in Italy until 1509, received everywhere with marks of great distinction, having by this time won a reputation for brilliant scholarship, and in April of that year revisited England, where he became the guest of More at London, and by the influence of Bishop Fisher of Rochester was appointed Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity and Regius Reader of Greek in the University of Cambridge, at which seat of learning the study of Greek was then of recent introduction.</p>
 <p>Erasmus had now, by his writings, his orations, and by the force of a most attractive personality, attained to a great reputation among the accomplished and learned men of Europe. Presents flowed in upon him, and from this time to the end of his life he lived in ease and opulence. Archbishop Warham sent him large sums of money and secured him a pension of a hundred crowns. A like pension was granted him by Lord Mountjoy. Offers of church preferment were made to him in many countries; the Duke of Bavaria offered him a chair in the new University of Ingolstadt with no duties attached; Louvain offered him a professorship with the degree of D.D.; the Austrian archduke Ferdinand promised him a pension of 400 florins if he would only take up his residence in Vienna; Pope Clement VII. sent him 200 florins; Pope Adrian VI. wished to give him a deanery; and King Francis I. joined with the Bishop of Bayeux in a vain effort to secure Erasmus for France. Presents of wine from his numerous admirers and of sweetmeats from the nuns of Cologne reached him continually.</p>
 <p>In 1513 Erasmus left England, and being possessed of a restless disposition, aggravated by a nervous disorder, he travelled from place to place upon the Continent; and after several years of almost incessant journeying back and forth he made his home at Basle, to which he had first been attracted by the fame of its press and of the distinguished men whom he met there, among them Zwingli the reformer, Hans Holbein the artist, and the circle of admiring students who clustered about Erasmus, such as Beatus Rhenanus, his biographer, Sapidus, Oecolampadius, Beer, Myconius, and Glareanus.</p>
 <p>In 1520 he settled permanently in Basle, and there became the general editor of Froben's press, which, during the eight years of Erasmus's association with it, took the lead of all the presses in Europe, both in the value of the works which issued from it and in the excellence of its typographical execution. In these works Erasmus had an important share as translator and editor, but his part can not be readily differentiated from <cb /> those of his numerous associates. The prefaces and dedications were always of his composition. Besides the great labour of these duties he found time to write a large number of pamphlets, often polemic, and to carry on a correspondence that sometimes compelled him to write forty letters in a single day. “I receive daily,” he says, “letters from remote parts, from kings, princes, prelates, and learned men, and even from persons of whose existence I was ignorant.”</p>
 <p>The religious disturbances in Switzerland, and the death of Froben, led him in 1529 to remove to Freiburg, where he resided for six years, returning in 1535 to Basle. The new pope, Paul III., nominated him to a deanery with an income of 1500 ducats and hinted at a cardinal's hat for him. An attack of dysentery, however, carried him off July 12, 1536, in his sixty-ninth year.</p>
 <p>Erasmus was a man of a singularly refined and amiable character—witty, judicious, and of great erudition, coupled with a gift of literary expression rare even in so elegant a scholar. Alone among the learned men of his time he exhibits a “sweet reasonableness” and a freedom from bigotry, either theological or philological, that is perhaps his most striking characteristic. While criticising, often with inimitable wit and satire, the theological warriors of his own Church, he exhibits little sympathy with the Protestant champions. The coarseness and vulgarity of Luther's controversial writings were especially offensive to him; and he disliked the unfavourable influence of religious polemics upon the development of literature. He stands, in fact, as “the supreme type of cultivated common-sense applied to human affairs, and no man of letters has ever attained to anything approaching the influence wielded by Erasmus during his own century. . . . He owed his position to the wonderful range of his activity, to his astonishing productiveness, to the breadth and sanity of his views, and to the delightful qualities of wit, humour, and unfailing vivacity which distinguish all his work” (Hume Brown). As a classicist, he stands between the strict humanists of the Latin Renaissance on the one hand and the Graecizing scholars who follow him. As Pattison puts it, he is a mean between Politian and Joseph Scaliger. He was, in fact, rather a great man of letters than a great scholar. He knew little or nothing of the true principles of text criticism, he was not scrupulously accurate, and his Greek learning was very imperfect. Judged by a comparison with the classic models, his Latin even is at times almost barbarous. But this is only a narrow view. The Latinity of Erasmus had qualities above those of mere correctness and purity. It was with him a living and a spoken tongue, rich, plastic, natural, and full of virile force, and not like the Latin of Bembo and Sadoleto—a mere echo, a cold and lifeless imitation.</p>
 <p>The personal appearance of Erasmus is thus described by his disciple, Beatus Rhenanus: “In stature not tall, but not noticeably short; in figure well built and graceful; of an extremely delicate constitution, sensitive to the slightest change of climate, food, or drink. . . . His complexion was fair; light blue eyes and yellowish hair. Though his voice was weak, his enunciation was distinct; the expression of his face was cheerful; his manner and conversation were polished, affable, and even charming.” 
<pb n="619" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Of his numerous works, the following are of especial importance to the classical student: the <title>Adagia</title> or <title>Adagiorum Chiliades</title>, a manual of the wit and wisdom of the ancient world with a finely executed commentary <bibl default="NO">(1st ed. Paris, 1500; enlarged eds. 1515 and 1536)</bibl>; an edition of the Greek Testament with a new Latin version and notes, the text of which became the starting-point of modern exegetical science <bibl default="NO">(Basle, 1516; later editions in 1519, 1522, 1527, 1535)</bibl>; <title>Ciceronianus</title>, a satire on the pedantic imitations of Cicero by the Italian school of Latinists; and the <title>Colloquia</title>, his most famous work, of which the first edition appeared in 1519 and was afterwards greatly enlarged. It consists of a series of familiar dialogues in Latin on a great variety of topics—social, religious, and political—and marked by wit, fancy, and a brilliant audacity of treatment.</p>
 <p>The first complete edition of the works of Erasmus appeared in 9 vols. at Basle in 1540; the standard edition is that of Le Clerc in 10 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Lyons, 1703-06)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosseratosthenes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eratosthĕnes">Eratosthenes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐρατοσθένης</foreign>). A distinguished contemporary of Archimedes, born at Cyrené, B.C. 276. He possessed a variety of talents seldom united in the same individual. His mathematical, astronomical, and geographical labours are those which have rescued his name from oblivion, though he was, besides, famous for his athletic prowess. The Alexandrian school of sciences, which flourished under the first Ptolemies, had already produced Timochares and Aristyllus; and Eratosthenes had not only the advantages arising from the instruments and observations of his predecessors, but the great Alexandrian library, which probably contained all the Phoenician, Chaldaic, Egyptian, and Greek learning of the time, was intrusted to his superintendence by the third Ptolemy (Euergetes), who had invited him to Alexandria.</p>
 <p>The only work attributed to Eratosthenes which has come down to us entire is entitled <foreign lang="greek">Καταστερισμοί</foreign>, and is merely a catalogue of the names of <cb /> forty-four constellations, and the situations in each constellation of the principal stars, of which he enumerates nearly five hundred, but without one reference to astronomical measurement. We find Hipparchus quoted in it, and mention made of the motion of the pole, that of the polar star having been recognized by Pytheas. These circumstances, taken in conjunction with the vagueness of the descriptions, render its genuineness extremely doubtful.</p>
 <p>If Eratosthenes be really the author of the <foreign lang="greek">Καταστερισμοί</foreign>, it must have been composed merely as a <seg lang="la">vade mecum</seg>, for we find him engaged in astronomical researches far more exact and more worthy of his genius. By his observations he determined that the distance between the tropics, that is, twice the obliquity of the ecliptic, was 11/83 of an entire circumference, or 47° 42' 39", which makes the obliquity to be 23° 51' 19.5", nearly the same as that supposed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. As the means of observation were at that time very imperfect, the instruments divided only to intervals of 10', and as corrections for the greater refraction at the winter solstice, for the diameter of the solar disc, etc., were then unknown, we must regard this conclusion as highly creditable to Eratosthenes. His next achievement was to measure the circumference of the earth. He knew that at Syené the sun was vertical at noon in the summer solstice; while at Alexandria, at the same moment, it was below the zenith by the fiftieth part of a circumference: the two places are nearly on the same meridian (error 2°). Neglecting the solar parallax, he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syené is the fiftieth part of the circumference of the earth; this distance he estimated at five thousand stadia, which gives two hundred and fifty thousand stadia for the circumference. Thus Eratosthenes has the merit of pointing out a method for finding the circumference of the earth. But his data were not sufficiently exact, nor had he the means of measuring the distance from Alexandria to Syené with sufficient precision.</p>
 <p>Eratosthenes has been called a poet, and Scaliger, in his commentary on Manilius, gives some fragments of a poem attributed to him, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμῆς</foreign>, one of which is a description of the terrestrial zones. It is not improbable that these are authentic.</p>
 <p>That Eratosthenes was an excellent geometrician we can not doubt, from his still extant solution of the problem of two mean proportionals, preserved by Theon , and a lost treatise quoted by Pappus, <title>De Locis ad Medietates.</title></p>
 <p>Eratosthenes appears to have been one of the first who attempted to form a system of geography. His work on this subject, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Γεωγραφικά</foreign> (<title>Geographica</title>), was divided into three books. The first contained a history of geography, a critical notice of the authorities used by him, and the elements of physical geography. The second book treated of mathematical geography. The third contained the political or historical geography of the then known world. The whole work was accompanied with a map.</p>
 <p>Eratosthenes also busied himself with chronology, and suggested the Julian calendar, in which every fourth year has 366 days. Some remarks on his Greek chronology will be found in Clinton's <title>Fasti Hellenici</title> (vol. i. pp. 3, 408); and on his list of Theban kings, in Rask's work on the ancient Egyptian chronology <bibl default="NO">(Altona, 1830)</bibl>. 
<pb n="620" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The properties of numbers attracted the attention of philosophers from the earliest period, and Eratosthenes also distinguished himself in this branch. He wrote a work on the duplication of the cube—<foreign lang="greek">Κύβου Διπλασιασμός</foreign>—which we only know by a sketch that Eudoxus has given of it, in his treatise on the Sphere and Cylinder of Archimedes. Eratosthenes composed, also, another work in this department, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Κόσκινον</foreign>, or “the Sieve,” the object of which was to separate prime from composite numbers. Eratosthenes arrived at the age of eighty years, and then, becoming weary of life, died by voluntary starvation (B.C. 196). The best editions of the <foreign lang="greek">Καταστερισμοί</foreign> are that of Schaubach, with notes by Heyne <bibl default="NO">(Göttingen, 1795)</bibl>, and that of Matthiae, in his Aratus <bibl default="NO">(Frankfurt, 1817)</bibl>. The fragments of Eratosthenes have been collected by Bernhardy in his work <bibl default="NO"><title>Eratosthenica</title> (Berlin, 1822)</bibl>, and the poetical remains separately by Hiller <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1872)</bibl>.

Entering through the eastern portico of six Ionic pillars, one came into the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> of Athené Polias, with an image of the goddess, and a lamp that was always kept burning. To the solid wall at the back was attached the Erechtheum proper. Here were three altars, one common to Poseidon and Erechtheus, the other to Hephaestus and the hero Butes. Connected with this, by three doors, was a small front chamber, with seven half-columns adorning the western wall, and three windows between them. This chamber was approached through a hall attached to the north side of the temple, adorned with seven Ionic columns in front, and one on each side. Under this was a cleft in the rock, said to have been made by the stroke of Poseidon's trident during his contest

 with Athené for the possession of the Acropolis. Corresponding to this on the south side was a small hall, supported not by pillars, but by caryatides. This was called the Hall of Coré, and it probably contained the tomb of Cecrops. From it a step led down to a court, once walled round, in which were the Pandroseum (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspandrosos">Pandrosos</ref>), the sacred olive-tree of Athené, and the altar of Zeus Herkeios. On the east side, in front of the temple of Athené Polias, stood the altar on which the great hecatomb was offered at the Panathenaea.

<head orig="Erechtheus">Erechtheus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐρεχθεύς</foreign>). A mythical king of Athens. According to Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 547" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 547</bibl>, etc.; <title>Odyss.</title> vii. 81), he was the son of Earth by Hephaestus, and was reared by Athené. Like that of Cecrops, half of his form was that of a snake— a sign that he was one of the aborigines. Athené put the child in a chest, which she gave to the daughters of Cecrops—Agraulos, Hersé, and Pandrosos—to take care of, forbidding them at the same time to open it (Hygin. <title>Poet. Astr.</title> ii. 13). The first two disobeyed, and in terror at the serpent-shaped child (or, according to another version, the snake that surrounded the child), they went mad, and threw themselves from the rocks of the Acropolis. Another account made the serpent kill them. Erechtheus drove out Amphictyon, and got possession of the kingdom. He then established the worship of Athené, and built to her, as goddess of the city (<foreign lang="greek">Πολιάς</foreign>), a temple, named after him the Erechtheum. Here he was afterwards himself worshipped with Athené and Poseidon. He was also the founder of the Panathenaic festival. He was said to have invented the four-wheeled chariot, and to have been taken up to heaven for this by Zeus, and set in the sky as the constellation of the Charioteer. His daughters were Orithyia and Procris. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossboreas">Boreas</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscephalus">Cephalus</ref>.) Originally identified with <ref type="cross" target="crosserichthonius">Erichthonius</ref>, he was in later times distinguished from him, and was regarded as his grandson, and as son of Pandion and Zeuxippé. His twin-brother was Butes, his sisters Procné and Philomela. The priestly office fell to Butes, while Erechtheus assumed the functions of royalty. By Praxithea, the daughter of Cephissus, he was father of the second Cecrops (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspandion">Pandion</ref>, 2), of Metion (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedalus">Daedalus</ref>), of Creüsa (see <ref type="cross" target="crossion">Ion</ref>), as well as of Protogenia, Pandora, and Chthonia. When Athens was hard pressed by the Eleusinians under Eumolpus, the oracle promised him the victory if he would sacrifice one of his daughters. He chose the youngest, Chthonia; but Protogenia and Pandora, who had made a vow with their sister to die with her, voluntarily shared her fate. Erechtheus conquered his enemies and slew Eumolpus, but was afterwards destroyed by the trident of his enemy's father, Poseidon. The myth of Erechtheus has suggested the subject for Swinburne's tragedy <bibl default="NO"><title>Erechtheus</title> (London, 1876)</bibl>.

The latter opinion is far more probable, as this city was doubtless of Ionic origin ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 46</bibl>). We learn from Strabo that Eretria was formerly called Melaneïs and Arotria, and that at an early period it had attained to a considerable degree of prosperity and power. The Eretrians conquered the islands of Ceos, Teos, Tenos, and others; and in their festival of Artemis, which was celebrated with great splendour, three thousand soldiers on foot, with six hundred cavalry and sixty chariots, were often employed to attend the procession (cf. <bibl n="Liv.  35. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxv. 38</bibl>). Eretria, at this period, was frequently engaged in war with Chalcis, and Thucydides reports (i. 15) that on one occasion most of the Grecian States took part in the contest. The assistance which Eretria then received from the Milesians induced that city to cooperate with the Athenians in sending a fleet and troops to the support of the Ionians, who had revolted from Persia at the instigation of Aristagoras ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 99" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 99</bibl>), by which measure it became exposed, in conjunction with Athens, to the vengeance of Darius. That monarch accordingly gave orders to his commanders, Datis and Artaphernes, to subdue both Eretria and Athens and bring the inhabitants captive before him. Eretria was taken after six days' siege, and the captive inhabitants brought to Asia. Darius treated the prisoners kindly, and settled them in the district of Cissia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 119" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 119</bibl>). Eretria recovered from the effects of this disaster and was rebuilt soon after. We find it mentioned by Thucydides, towards the close of his history (viii. 94), as revolting from Athens on the approach of a Spartan fleet under Hegesandridas, and mainly contributing to the success obtained by that commander. After the death of Alexander, this city surrendered to Ptolemy, a general in the service of Antigonus; and in the Macedonian War, to the combined fleets of the Romans, the Rhodians, and Attalus (<bibl n="Liv.  32. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxii. 16</bibl>). It was subsequently declared free by order of the Roman Senate (Polyb. xviii. 28 foll.). This place, as we learn from Athenaeus, was noted for the excellence of its flour and bread. At one time it possessed a distinguished school of philosophy and dialectics. The ruins of Eretria are still to be observed close to a headland which lies opposite to the mouth of the Asopus in Boeotia.</p>

All that is known of her is contained in the following words of Eustathius ( <bibl n="Eustathius ad Il. 2." default="NO"> <title>ad Il.</title>ii.</bibl> p. 327): “Erinna was born in Lesbos, or in Rhodes, or in Teos, or in Telos, the little island near Cnidus. She was a poetess, and wrote a poem called ‘the Distaff’ (<foreign lang="greek">Ἠλακάτη</foreign>) in the Aeolic and Doric dialect; it consisted of 300 hexameter lines. She was the friend of Sappho, and died unmarried. It was thought that her verses rivalled those of Homer. She was only nineteen years of age when she died.” Chained by her mother to the spinning-wheel, Erinna had as yet known the charm of existence in imagination alone. She probably expressed in her poem the restless and aspiring thoughts which crowded on her youthful mind as she pursued her monotonous work. We possess at the present day only four lines by Erinna; for though three epigrams ascribed to her are given by Schneidewin in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Delectus Poësis Graecae Elegiacae</title> (Göttingen, 1839)</bibl>, two at least are not genuine.</p>

His name does not occur in Homer; but in Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 120 foll.) he is the fairest of the deities, who subdues the hearts of both gods and men. He is born from Chaos at the same time as the Earth and Tartarus, and is the comrade of 
<pb n="623" /><cb />
 Aphrodité from the moment of her birth. Hesiod conceives Eros not merely as the god of sensual love, but as a power which forms the world by inner union of the separated elements—an idea very prevalent in antiquity, especially among the philosophers. According to the later and commoner notion, Eros was the youngest of the gods, generally the son of Aphrodité by Ares or Hermes, always a child, thoughtless and capricious. He is as irresistible as fair, and has no pity even for his own mother. Zeus, the father of gods and men, arms him with golden wings, and with bow and unerring arrows, or burning torches. Anteros, the god of mutual love, is his brother, and his companions are Pothos and Himeros, the personifications of longing and desire, with Peitho (Persuasion), the Muses, and the Graces. In later times he is surrounded by a crowd of similar beings, Erotes or Loves. (For the later legend of Eros and Psyché, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspsyche">Psyché</ref>.)</p>
 <p>One of the chief and oldest seats of his worship was Thespiae in Boeotia. Here was his most ancient image, a rough, unhewn stone. His festival, the Erotia or Erotidia, continued till the time of the Roman Empire to be celebrated every fifth year with much ceremony, accompanied by gymnastic and musical contests. Besides this he received special honour and worship in the gymnasia, where his statue generally stood near those of <figure id="fig.00623">
<head orig="Eros. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)">Eros. (Rome, Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> Hermes and Heracles. In the gymnasia, Eros was the personification of devoted friendship and love between youths and men; the friendship which proved itself active and helpful in battle and bold adventure. This was the reason why the Spartans and Cretans sacrificed to Eros before a battle, and the sacred band of youths at Thebes was dedicated to him; why a festival of freedom (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐλευθέρια</foreign>) was held at Samos in his honour, as the god who bound men and youths together in the struggle for honour and freedom; and why at Athens <cb /> he was worshipped as the liberator of the city, in memory of Harmodius and <ref type="cross" target="crossaristogiton">Aristogiton</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>In works of art Eros was usually represented as a beautiful boy, close upon the age of youth. In later times he also appears as a child with the attributes of a bow and arrows, or burning torches, and in a great variety of situations. The most celebrated statues of this god were by Lysippus, Scopas, and Praxiteles whose Eros at Thespiae was regarded as a masterpiece, and unsurpassable. The famous torso in the Vatican, in which the god wears a dreamy, lovelorn air, is popularly, but probably erroneously, traced to an original by Praxiteles. The Eros trying his bow, in the Capitoline Museum at Rome, is supposed to be the copy of a work by Lysippus (see illustration). The Roman god Amor or Cupido was a mere adaptation of the Greek Eros, and was never held in great esteem. <ref type="cross" target="crossanteros">Antĕros</ref> was the brother of Eros and punished those who did not requite the love of others (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

A name applied to the whole ocean by the Greeks, extending from the coast of Ethiopia to the island of Taprobana, when their geographical knowledge of India was in its infancy. They believed the name to be derived from that of Erythras, an ancient monarch who reigned along these coasts, and asserted that his grave was to be found in one of the adjacent islands (Curtius, viii. 9, 14). Afterwards, when the Greeks learned the existence of an Indian Ocean, the term was applied merely to the sea below Arabia, and to the Arabian and Persian Gulfs. In this latter sense Strabo uses the name. Herodotus follows the old acceptation of the word, according to the opinion prevalent in his age. The appellation was probably derived from Edom (Esan), whose descendants were called Idumaeans, and inhabited the northern parts of Arabia. They navigated upon the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and also upon the Indian Ocean; and the Oriental name Edom signifying <hi rend="italic">red</hi>, the sea of the Idumaeans was called the Red Sea and the Erythraean Sea (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα</foreign>), of which the Latin <title>Mare Rubrum</title> is a translation.

On its summit stood a famous temple of Aphrodité Erycina, and on the western declivity was situated the town of Eryx, the approach to which from the plain was rocky and difficult. At the distance of thirty stadia stood the harbour of the same name (Polyb. i. 55; <bibl n="Diod.  24. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xxiv. 1</bibl>; <title>in Ver.</title> ii. 8). The Phoenicians were most probably the founders of the place and also of the temple, and the Erycinian Aphrodité appears to be identified with the Astarté of the latter people. The native inhabitants in this quarter were called Elymi, and Eryx is said by some to have been their king. Vergil <cb /> makes Aeneas to have founded the temple. The town was destroyed by the Carthaginians in the time of Pyrrhus, who a short time previous had taken it by storm, and the inhabitants were removed to Drepanum ( <bibl n="Diod.  22. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xxii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Diod.  23. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod., xxiii. 9</bibl>). It soon, however, revived, owing to the celebrity of the adjacent temple. In the First Punic War it fell into the hands of the Romans, but was surprised by Barcas, the Carthaginian commander, and the inhabitants who escaped the slaughter were again removed to Drepanum ( <bibl n="Diod.  24. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xxiv. 2</bibl>). The place never recovered from this blow; the sanctity of the temple drew, indeed, new inhabitants around, but the city was never rebuilt. No traces of the temple remain at the present day.

<head orig="Essĕdum">Essedum</head>

 <p> rarely <hi rend="bold">Essĕda,</hi> said to be a Keltic word. The name of a chariot used, especially in war, by the Britons, Gauls, and Belgae, perhaps also by the Germans ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 3. 204" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iii. 204</bibl>; <seg lang="la">Serv. ad loc.</seg>).</p>
 <p>According to the account given by Caesar (<title>B. G.</title> iv. 35) the method of using the essedum in the ancient British army was very similar to the practice of the Greeks in the heroic ages, as described in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscurrus">Currus</ref>. The principal difference seems to have been that the essedum was stronger and more solid than the <foreign lang="greek">δίφρος</foreign>—that it was open before instead of behind; hence the driver was able to run along the pole (<title>de temone Britanno excidet</title>, <bibl n="Juv.  4. 125" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iv. 125</bibl>) and then to retreat with the greatest speed into the body of the car, which he drove with extraordinary swiftness and skill. From the extremity of the pole he threw his missiles, especially the <seg lang="la">cateia</seg> ( Flacc. <title>Argon.</title> vi. 83). It appears also that these cars were purposely made as noisy as possible, probably by the creaking and clanging of the wheels ( <title>Agric.</title> 35; Claud. <bibl n="Cic. Epigr. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epigr.</title>4</bibl>); and that this was done in order to strike dismay into the enemy. The drivers of these chariots were called in Latin <seg lang="la">essedarii</seg> ( <title>B. G.</title> iv. 24). Tacitus (<title>Agric.</title> 12) observes that the driver of the car ranked above his fighting companion, which was the reverse of the Greek usage.</p>
 <p>The essedum was adopted for purposes of convenience and luxury among the Romans (Propert. ii. 1, 76; cic. <title>Ad Att.</title> vi. 1; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Am. 2. 16. 49" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Am.</title>ii. 16, 49</bibl>). Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2. 24. 58" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phil.</title>ii. 24. 58</bibl>) mentions the use of it by Antonius as a piece of effeminacy disgraceful to a tribune of the people; but in the time of Seneca it seems to have become common ( <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 48" default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>48</bibl>, Hase). As used by the Romans the essedum had no seat for the driver; the traveller drove himself (Ovid, l. c.), and always, it would seem, with a pair of horses, whereas with the <seg lang="la">cisium</seg> the number varied. The essedum, like the <seg lang="la">cisium</seg>, appears to have been kept for hire at the post-houses or stations ( <bibl n="Mart.  10. 104" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.x. 104</bibl>).

 each a year. Eteocles, by right of seniority, first ascended the throne; but after the first year of his reign had expired he refused to give up the crown to his brother according to their mutual agreement. Polynices, resolving to punish so gross a violation of a solemn engagement, fled to the court of Adrastus, king of Argos, where he married Argia, the daughter of that monarch; and having prevailed upon Adrastus to espouse his cause, the latter undertook what was denominated the First Theban War, twenty-seven years, as is said, before the Trojan one. Adrastus marched against Thebes with an army, of which he took the command, having with him seven celebrated chiefs, Tydeus, Amphiaraus, Capanaeus, Parthenopaeus, Hippomedon, Eteoclus, son of Iphis, and Polynices. The Thebans who espoused the cause of Eteocles were Melanippus and Ismarus, sons of Astacus, Polyphontes, Megareus, Lasthenes, and Hyperbius. All the Argive leaders, with the exception of Adrastus, fell before Thebes, Eteocles also being slain in single combat with Polynices. Ten years after the conclusion of this war arose that of the Epigoni, or the sons of the slain chieftains of Argos, who took up arms to avenge the death of their sires. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepigoni">Epigoni</ref>.)

<head orig="Etruria">Etruria</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Tuscia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Τυρρηνία, Τυρσηία</foreign>). A country of Italy once inhabited by the people known as the Etruscans (Tusci). It lay west of the river Tiber and the Apennines, extending to the sea, and including the valley of the Arno. When authentic history begins, the Etruscans, in addition to this territory, held also the valley of the Padus (Etruria Circumpadana) and a further strip south of the Tiber (Etruria Campaniana). From the former territory they were crowded southward by the Gauls (see <ref type="cross" target="crossceltae">Celtae</ref>), and from the latter the Romans subsequently drove them. Etruria Proper was a confederation of twelve States or cities (<title>duodecim populi Etruriae</title>), of which no complete list has reached us, though it is fairly certain that the following towns were eleven of the twelve: Veii, Caeré, Tarquinii, Clusium, Cortona, Perusia, Volsinii, Vulci, Vetulonia, Volaterrae, and Arretium. The twelfth was in all probability either Falerii, Populonia, or Rusellae. Of the northern league, the following were important towns: Felsina (Bononia), Mantua, Ravenna, Chiavenna, and Hatria or Hadria, which gives its name to the Hadriaticum Mare. In the south, Capua and Nola were rich and powerful cities. Like Etruria Proper, the northern league was one of twelve States.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Ethnology</hi>.—The earliest traditions to which we now have access make the Etrurians a Lydian <cb /> people ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 94" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 94</bibl> <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 166" default="NO" valid="yes">166</bibl> <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 171" default="NO" valid="yes">171</bibl>). But this theory, which was carefully considered by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his work on the origins of Rome, appears to rest upon no convincing evidence. Dionysius notes that it is not mentioned by Xanthus, the historian of Lydia, and sums up the results of his own investigations by saying that “the Etruscans do not resemble any other people either in language or in manners.” This conclusion is interesting, for Dionysius had given much thought and time to the consideration of the question, and is said to have written a work on the Etruscans in twenty books, during the reign of Augustus, when there was a sort of Etrurian revival, in which everything Etruscan was the fashion. The identification of the Etruscans with the Lydians was very likely due to a confusion of the Lydian <foreign lang="greek">Τορρηβοί</foreign> with the name <foreign lang="greek">Τυρσηνοί</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Τυρρηνοί</foreign>, applied to the Etruscans by the Greeks. (Cf. Hesiod, <title>Theog.</title> 1015; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 3. 577" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>iii. 577</bibl> foll.;  <bibl n="Plin.

Ann. 4. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 24</bibl>; and see Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, bk. i. ch. ix.) The confusion was easier because of the maritime prowess of both peoples and their piratical practices ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 22</bibl>; <bibl n="Strab.  219" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.219</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Modern investigators have not been deterred by the ill success of Dionysius from attempting to solve the problem of the ethnological affinities of the Etruscans; but no definite and generally accepted conclusions have yet been reached. For purposes of investigation there have been collected some 6000 or more Etruscan inscriptions, the characters resembling Pelasgian or early Greek. There are also vast collections of their pottery, <figure id="fig.00625">

 bronzes, jewels, and other works of Tuscan art. Fifteen bilingual inscriptions give some further aid on the side of the language, but less than one might suppose, for they consist only of proper names. The longest inscription yet discovered is that found at Perugia in 1822, consisting of fortysix lines, in red, upon two sides of a block of stone (the “Cippus Perusinus”). These records are in the main mortuary records taken from tombs, walls, or the labels and seals of mortuary niches, or still oftener painted upon urns or cut into sarcophagi. They usually give the name, parentage, age, and rank of the deceased, with a list of the offices that he held. The most noted investigations of the origins and affinities of the Etruscans have been those of K. O. Müller, whose dissertation on the subject in two volumes <bibl default="NO">(Breslau, 1828; 2d ed. Stuttgart, 1877)</bibl> received a prize from the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and Wilhelm <ref type="cross" target="crosscorssen">Corssen</ref> (q.v.), who also published two elaborate volumes <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1874-75)</bibl>. Later works are those of Deecke and Pauli.</p>
 <p>By these scholars some progress has been made towards a knowledge of the peculiarities of the Etruscan language. Besides proper names, some 200 other words have been deciphered, among them a number of numerals, including the first six digits, the common words denoting relationships, and several verbal forms. As a matter of general interest, the following list of Etruscan words may be given from Pauli: <table> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">clan...........son.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">thu.............five.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">puia...........wife.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">huth............six.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">sekh...........daughter.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">suthinese........urn-niches.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">lautni..........a freedman.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">tular............pillar (<seg lang="la">cippus</seg>).</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">cvil (cver)......gift, dedication.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">amce...........fuit.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">mach..........one.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">ma.............est.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">ci..............two.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">ture.............dat.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">zal............three.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">turce............dedit.</cell> </row> <row role="data"> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">sa.............four.</cell> <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">arce.............habuit.</cell> </row> </table></p>
 <p>Relationship is expressed by separate words (as above), or (more commonly) by suffixes: thus, <title>Aulesa</title>, “wife of Aulé,” <title>Theprisa</title>, “wife of Thepri,” etc. Other linguistic facts that have been satisfactorily established regarding the Etruscan tongue are these: the existence of gender, the use of enclitics, the genitive singular in -<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, the dative in -<seg lang="la">si</seg> or -<seg lang="la">thi</seg>, the absence of distinction between the nominative and accusative in nouns, and the formation of a plural in -<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or -<hi rend="italic">l.</hi></p>
 <p>The Egyptian monuments speak of a people called Tursha as taking part with the Sardinians, Teucri, and other people from the coasts of “the North” in an invasion of Egypt about B.C. 1200; but the Tursha can not be definitely identified with the Tyrrhenians any more than can the Tyrrhenians with the Etruscans. Support is given to the Lydian hypothesis by the discovery made in 1886 by two French scholars, who found in the island of Lemnos a sepulchral monument with two Etruscan inscriptions, though of a dialectic character. Now, Thucydides states that Lemnos was inhabited by Tyrrheni, so that in the finding of these inscriptions Pauli sees evidence of the identity of the two peoples. See Bréal in the <title>Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique</title>, vol. x. <bibl default="NO">(1886)</bibl>; and Pauli, <bibl default="NO"><title>Eine vorgriechische Inschrift von Lemnos</title> (Leipzig, 1886)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>An interesting discovery was made in 1891 by Prof. Krall of Vienna. About 1850, a mummy was deposited in the Museum of Agram by an Austrian traveller who had brought it from Egypt. When unrolled, it was found that the linen cloths in <cb /> which it had been wrapped were covered with written characters. These, when examined in 1867 by Brugsch Pasha, were pronounced by him to be Ethiopic. In 1877 Sir Richard Burton explained them as Nabathean. It remained for Prof. Krall to prove that the characters are Etruscan, and that the words which they embody are found in the existing inscriptions of Etruria. They form, in fact, a book, of which the text originally consisted of twelve columns. More than two hundred lines are intact, including the last paragraph of the book. The mummy around which the linen bands were wrapped is that of a woman, and the gilding on the face and shoulders proves it to belong to the Greek or Roman period. Now, as Etruscan was still spoken and read in the first century A.D., it is easy to see how an Etruscan book could have found its way to Egypt, when both Etruria and Egypt were parts of the same Empire. The few words of the book that had been identified in 1893 make it probable that it is one of the semireligious, semi-magical works for which the Etruscans were celebrated. With the material for study and comparison afforded by the continuous text of this book, the problem of the Etruscan language seems likely to be brought at least measurably near to a satisfactory solution. The transcription and photographs of the text, with an account of Prof. Krall's discovery, were published by the Imperial Academy of Vienna in 1892 (<title>Die Etruskischen Mumienbinden des Agramer National-Museums</title>). See, also, an article by Prof. Sayce in the <title>Fortnightly Review</title> for February, 1893.</p>
 <p>Until lately philologists were in the main divided into two great camps on the question of the racial and linguistic affinities of the Etruscans—one set of scholars holding to the theory of a Semitic origin and the other to that of an Aryan. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.) But the actual failure of Dr. Corssen to establish the Aryan hypothesis has to some extent simplified the problem, and the controversy is now carried on over the Semitic theory and the Ugro-Altaic, this last having been very ingeniously, though not convincingly, set forth by Dr. Isaac Taylor in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Etruscan Researches</title> (London, 1874)</bibl>. There are many coincidences that make the Semitic hypothesis seem plausible. There are Semitic peculiarities traceable in the language—e. g. the reduplication of consonants, the omission of short vowels, and the retrograde writing. The religion of the Etruscans was a species of mysticism like that of the Semites of Carthage; their ruling class was a priesthood and their theology a system of casuistry, as with the Jews; while their rites were gloomy and horrible, like those of the Phoenicians. Again, their art possesses the peculiar rigidity, the conventionality, and the lack of expression that mark the art and architecture of the Asiatic Semites. Finally, their physical characteristics were Semitic in that the Etruscans depicted themselves upon their monuments as short, thickset, with large heads and clumsy limbs (cf.  <bibl n="Verg. G. 2. 193" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>ii. 193</bibl>), and the aquiline nose that is one of the most noticeable peculiarities of the Semitic peoples. But while these coincidences are striking, they are not conclusive, and perhaps the most reasonable view is that of Müller, who regards the Etruscans as an Asiatic non-Aryan people intermingled with Aryan elements derived from the tribes which they gradually conquered and subdued. Their earliest 
<pb n="627" /><cb />
 home in Italy was on the Padus, and as late as Livy 's time the people of the Rhaetian Alps spoke a dialect of Etruscan (<bibl n="Liv.  5. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 33</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>iii. 20</bibl>; Justin. xx. 5; and Oberziner, <title>I Reti</title> [1883]). The theory of a blending of two races, or rather of the grafting of an Aryan branch upon a nonAryan stock, would account for the two main features that present themselves in the Etruscan problem—the fact that, in the main, the Etruscans have nothing in common with their neighbours of Italy, and the additional fact that their language does seem to show some slight traces of Aryan influence—about as much, for instance, as that of the British Kelts left upon the dialect of their Teutonic conquerors. This hypothesis is at least reasonable, unless we are willing to accept the conclusion of the scholars who disparagingly regard the Etruscan people and the Etruscan language as <seg lang="la">sui generis</seg>, representing a race and a speech that have become extinct.</p>
 <p>Conestabile and others hold that the Etrurian people contained two distinct elements—the one <figure id="fig.00627">
<head orig="Etruscans. (Painting from Caeré.)">Etruscans. (Painting from Caere.)</head>
</figure> native and servile, the other foreign and occupying the relation of lordship. Caeré and Cortona are said to have been Pelasgic cities before they were possessed by the Etruscans; and certain inscriptions once classed as Etruscan are now ascribed to the more ancient <ref type="cross" target="crosspelasgi">Pelasgi</ref> (q.v.). Livy states that the dialect of the Etrurians who inhabited the towns differed from that of the Etrurians of the country districts. Again, as Dr. Taylor points out, the rapid destruction of the Etrurian power in Campania and in the valley of the Padus makes it probable that it was a dominion of conquest rather than of colonization, and that the <title>Rasena</title>, or Etruscans proper, were a ruling aristocracy, of high culture and great ability, but few in number. All this is, in the main, corroborative of Müller's view.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Government and Civilization</hi>.—The Etrurian government was a federal league of the twelve cities already mentioned, each ruled by magistrates annually elected from a class of priestly nobles of hereditary rank. These magistrates bore the titles Lauchmé (Lucumo), Purtsvana (Porsena), and Marunuch, roughly corresponding to the Roman <cb /> officers of Consul, Imperator, and Dictator. The official insignia afterwards used in Rome—the purple robe, the praetexta, the lictors and fasces, the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, and the <seg lang="la">apparitores</seg>—were derived from Etruria. The representatives of the twelve towns met at the temple of Voltumna at a place not now known (cf. <bibl n="Liv.  4. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iv. 23</bibl>). Books of laws existed in accordance with which the internal affairs of the State were managed (<title>Libri Disciplinae</title>), as well as the religious rites and the division of the people. (See Festus, s. v. <title>Rituales</title>).</p>
 <p>That the civilization of the Etruscans was a highly developed one is shown by the little that we know of their social laws as well as by the evidences of their wealth, luxury, and power. The position of women was a high one; the wife was the social equal of the husband, as is shown by the sepulchral honours paid her, and by the pictures of domestic life pourtrayed on the sarcophagi and the vases. For a long time the Etruscans ranked as one of the three great naval powers of the Mediterranean. They are known, also, to have been familiar with the sciences, to have been skilled in mining, metallurgy, astronomy, and medicine, while their knowledge of engineering was conspicuous in the massive walls of their cities, built of huge blocks, perfectly fitted without cement, and in their roads, tunnels, and chambered tombs.</p>
 <p>In art and art-manufactures, the Etruscans stand very high. Their jewellery, which is in patterns formed by soldering on minute grains of gold, excites admiration, while their bronze-work, coinage, and mirrors are of very fine workmanship. Vast numbers of painted vases, found chiefly in tombs, possess both an historical and an artistic value. See <ref type="cross" target="crossfictile">Fictile</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvas">Vas</ref>.</p>
 <p>The religion of the Etruscans played a most important part in their lives, since they were proverbially devoted to the exercises of their faith, and we have, in fact, already noted that their very form of government was largely a system of sacerdotalism. Hence Livy describes the nation as <seg lang="la">gens ante omnes alias dedita religionibus</seg> (v. 1; see also i. 56 and v. 15); the early Fathers of the Christian Church denounced Etruria as <seg lang="la">genetrix et mater superstitionis;</seg> and Dionysius even went so

The deities of Greece and Rome appear in their mythology [e. g. Ani (Ianus), Maris (Mars), Nethuns (Neptunus), Uni (Iuno), Artumes (Artemis), Velch (Vulcanus)], besides whom there are a number of native gods, such as Fufluns, Tinia, Turms, Thesan, answering roughly to Bacchus, Iupiter, Mercury, and Aurora. The Sun and Moon figure as Usil and Lala. Other gods, some of whom are occasionally mentioned by the Roman writers, are Manius and Mania, king and queen of the lower world, Nortia (Fortuna), into the door of whose temple at Volsinii nails (<seg lang="la">clavi annales</seg>) were driven to mark the successive years, Summanus, the god of night, Vertumnus, the god of Autumn, and the Novensiles, a collective name of all the gods who hurled thunderbolts.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—Varro records a tradition that the Etruscan State was founded in the year B.C. 1044, and the Roman legends represent the Etruscans as a powerful and wealthy people at the time when Rome was founded. Later, but still during the early years of Rome, Etruria figures in history as a great naval power, allied with Carthage against the Greeks, and having kings of its own race dominant over the Romans, as the Roman historians themselves admit in recording the legend of the migration of the Tarquins from Tarquinii to Rome, and the sway of the Tarquinian dynasty. An Etruscan cemetery has been discovered on the Esquiline at Rome; the Caelian Hill bears the name of an Etruscan chief, Caeles Vibenna, while one of the oldest quarters of the city near the Palatine bore the name Vicus Tuscus. (See Mommsen, i. 4, p. 80; id. 9, p. 174 of the American ed.; cf. also Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 46). That the period of Etruscan domination at Rome <cb /> was one of much prosperity to the city is seen by the stories that have been transmitted to us of the magnificence of the Tarquins, and more forcibly by the vastness of the engineering works constructed at that time, such as the Cloaca Maxima, the Capitoline temple, and the Servian Wall. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>.</p>
 <p>Even after the expulsion of the kings from Rome, Etruria was still the greatest military power in Italy, and for a century the young Republic of Rome taxed all its energies in resisting the single Tuscan State of Veii, whose people in B.C. 476 actually succeeded in capturing the Ianiculum. During the period from B.C. 540 to 474, the Etruscans divided with the Greeks and Carthaginians the control of the Mediterranean, expelling the Greek colonists from Corsica (B.C. 538), an island which they still held in 453. In B.C. 525 they attacked the Greeks in Cumae, but in 474, Hiero of Syracuse, in a great naval battle fought off the Campanian coast, broke their naval power, and won a victory which is celebrated by Pindar in an extant ode (<title>Pyth.</title> i. 72). In 414, however, a contingent of their Etruscan ships was sent to aid the Athenians in their ill-fated expedition against Sicily. From this time the power of Etruria rapidly declined. In Campania, the Greeks of Cumae, aided by the Samnites, routed the Etruscan forces, and the Samnites carried Capua by storm; while in the north of Italy the Gauls swept down from the Alps, and, after overwhelming city after city, crossed the Apennines and made their way into the heart of Etruria. The rich Etruscan city of Melpum fell in B.C. 396, and not many years later, attacked by the Romans on the south, the <figure id="fig.00628.2">

<pb n="629" /><cb />
 southern province submitted to the Latin arms (B.C. 351). In 311, the Romans crossed the boundary formed by the Ciminian Forest, in spite of several successive defeats sustained by them at the hands of the Etruscans, and won a decisive victory in the year 283 at the Vadimonian Lake. Tarquinii almost immediately fell; and in 280 Volaterrae, the great northern fortress of the Etruscans, having succumbed, the long struggle ended with the complete triumph of the Roman arms.</p>
 <p>Though conquered, the Etruscan cities appear to have been treated with mildness and consideration, and to have sustained towards Rome the position of allies rather than subjects. In the Second Punic War they furnished supplies to the Roman fleet, and later they were actually admitted to the Roman franchise (B.C. 89). Some of the greatest names in the later history of the Roman State are the names of men of Etruscan lineage. Pompeius Magnus (Pompu), Maecenas, and the family of Caecina were among these; and under the emperors many other distinguished men show in their lineage kinship with the noble families of Etruria. In fact, as stated above, during the Augustan age an Etruscan fad generally prevailed at Rome, like our Anglomania of to-day or the Gallomania of 1856-70; and Etruscan ancestry was a thing to be proud of.</p>
 <p>The debt of Rome to her Etruscan neighbours has been variously regarded. In the Latin language, apart from a comparatively few terms of religion, augury, and warfare, there are no real traces of Etrurian influence. To the Romans, the Etruscans were always an alien race ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>ii. 4</bibl>; Plaut. <title>Curc.</title> 150), with whom, indeed, they traded and fought, and whose divination they employed; yet they never owned kinship with them, but rather let them hold the same relation towards Rome as did the Carthaginians, with whom the Latins also fought and traded. Yet the sway of the Etruscan kings at Rome did add much to the Roman ceremonial and the usages of Roman life. To Etruria are due the insignia of office, the fasces, the curule chair; and to the same source Rome owed the circus, the gladiatorial shows, the races, the triumph, the early monetary system, the rudiments of military science, the knowledge of augury, the <seg lang="la">tibicines</seg>, the <seg lang="la">lituus</seg>, and the art of building substantial houses, aqueducts, and sewers.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὔβοια</foreign>). Now Negropont; the largest island of the Aegaean Sea, lying along the coasts of Attica, Boeotia, and the southern part of Thessaly, from which countries it is separated by the Euboean Sea, called the Euripus in its narrowest part. Its early name was <hi rend="SmallCaps">Macris</hi>. Euboea is about ninety miles in length; its extreme breadth is thirty miles, but in the narrowest part it is only four miles across. Throughout the length of the island runs a lofty range of mountains, which rise in one part as high as 7266 feet above the sea. It contains, nevertheless, many fertile plains, and was celebrated in antiquity for the excellence of its pasturage and corn-fields. According to the ancients it was once united to Boeotia, from which it was separated by an earthquake. In Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 536" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 536</bibl>) the inhabitants are called Abantes, and are represented as taking part in the expedition against Troy. In the northern part of Euboea dwelt the Histiaei, from whom that part of the island was called Histiaea; below these were the Ellopii, who gave the name of Ellopia to the district, extending as far as Aegae and Cerinthus; and in the south were the Dryopes. The centre of the island was inhabited chiefly by Ionians. It was in this part of Euboea that the Athenians planted the colonies of Chalcis and Eretria, which were the two most important cities in the island. After the Persian Wars Euboea became subject to the Athenians, who attached much importance to its possession; and consequently Pericles made great exertions to subdue it, when it revolted in B.C. 445. Under the Romans Euboea formed part of the province of Achaea. See <bibl default="NO">Bursian, <title>Topogr. von Euboia</title> (1859)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐβουλίδης</foreign>). A native of Miletus and successor of Euclid in the Megaric school. He was a strong opponent of Aristotle, and seized every opportunity of censuring his writings and calumniating his character. He introduced new subtleties into the art of disputation, several of which, though often mentioned as proof of great ingenuity, deserve only to be remembered as examples of egregious trifling. Of these sophistical modes of reasoning, called by Aristotle “Eristic syllogisms,” a few examples may suffice. (1) <title>The Lying.</title> If, when you speak the truth, you say, you lie, you lie: but you say you lie when you speak the truth; therefore, in speaking the truth, you lie.</p>

<div2 id="crosseuclides" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Euclīdes">Euclides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐκλείδης</foreign>). (1) A native of Megara, founder of the Megaric, or Eristic sect. Endowed by nature with a subtle and penetrating genius, he early applied himself to the study of philosophy. The writings of Parmenides first taught him the art of disputation. Hearing of the fame of Socrates, Euclid determined to attend upon his instructions, and for this purpose removed from Megara to Athens. Here he long remained a constant hearer and zealous disciple of the moral philosopher; and when, in consequence of the enmity which subsisted between the Athenians and Megareans, a decree was passed by the former that any inhabitant of Megara who should be seen in Athens should forfeit his life, he frequently came to Athens by night, from the distance of about twenty miles, concealed in a long female cloak and veil, to visit his master (Aul. Gell. vii. 10). Not finding his propensity to disputation sufficiently gratified in the tranquil method of philosophizing adopted by Socrates, he frequently engaged in the business and the disputes of the civil courts. Socrates, who despised forensic contests, expressed some dissatisfaction with his pupil for indulging a fondness for controversy ( <bibl n="Diog.  2. 30" default="NO">Diog. Laert.ii. 30</bibl>). This cir cumstance <cb /> probably proved the occasion of a separation between Euclid and his master; for we find him, after this time, at the head of a school in Megara ( <bibl n="Diog.  3. 6" default="NO">Diog. Laert.iii. 6</bibl>), in which his chief employment was to teach the art of disputation. Debates were conducted with so much vehemence among his pupils that Timon said of Euclid that he had carried the madness of contention from Athens to Megara. That he was, however, capable of commanding his temper appears from his reply to his brother, who, in a quarrel, had said, “Let me perish if I be not revenged on you.” “And let <seg lang="la">me</seg> perish,” returned Euclid, “if I do not subdue your resentment by forbearance and make you love me as much as ever.”</p>
 <p>In argument Euclid was averse to the analogical method of reasoning, and judged that legitimate argument consists in deducing fair conclusions from acknowledged premises. He held that there is one supreme good, which he called by the different names of Intelligence, Providence, God; and that evil, considered as an opposite principle to the sovereign good, has no existence. The supreme good, according to Cicero, he defined to be that which is always the same. In this doctrine, in which he followed the subtlety of Parmenides rather than the simplicity of Socrates, he seems to have considered good abstractly as residing in the Deity, and to have maintained that all things which exist are good by their participation of the first good, and, consequently, that there is, in the nature of things, no real evil. It is said that when Euclid was asked his opinion concerning the gods, he replied, “I know nothing more of them than this: that they hate inquisitive persons.”
 </p>
 <p>(2) A celebrated mathematician of Alexandria, considered by some to have been a native of that city, though the more received opinion makes the place of his birth to have been unknown. He flourished B.C. 280, in the reign of Ptolemy Lagus, and was professor of mathematics in the capital of Egypt. His scholars were numerous, and among them was Ptolemy himself. It is related that the monarch having inquired of Euclid if there was not some mode of learning mathematics less barbarous and requiring less attention than the ordinary one, Euclid, though otherwise of an affable disposition, dryly answered that there was “no royal road to geometry” (<foreign lang="greek">μὴ εἶναι βασιλικὴν ἄτραπον πρὸς γεωμετρίαν</foreign>). Euclid was the first person who established a mathematical school at Alexandria, and it existed and maintained its reputation till the Mohammedan conquest of Egypt. Many of the fundamental principles of the pure mathematics had been discovered by Thales, Pythagoras, and other predecessors of Euclid; but to him is due the merit of having given a systematic form to the science, especially to that part of it which relates to geometry. He likewise studied the cognate sciences of Astronomy and Optics; and, according to Proclus, he was the author of “Elements” (<foreign lang="greek">Στοιχεῖα</foreign>), “Data” (<foreign lang="greek">Δεδομένα</foreign>), “An Introduction to Harmony” (<foreign lang="greek">Εἰσαγωγὴ Ἁρμονική</foreign>), “Phaenomena” (<foreign lang="greek">Φαινόμενα</foreign>), “Optics” (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀπτικά</foreign>), “Catoptrics” (<foreign lang="greek">Κατοπτρικά</foreign>), “On the Division of the Scale” (<foreign lang="greek">Κατατομὴ Κανόνος</foreign>), and other works now lost. His most valuable work, “The Elements of Geometry,” in thirteen books, with two additional books by Hypsicles, has been repeatedly published —the first edition at Venice <bibl default="NO">(1482)</bibl> in a Latin translation from the Arabic. 
<pb n="631" /><cb /> The first Greek text appeared at Basle in 1533. The edition of Peyrard is among the best. It appeared at Paris in 1814- 16-18, in 3 vols. This edition is accompanied with a double translation—one in Latin and the other in French. M. Peyrard consulted a manuscript of the latter part of the ninth century, which had belonged to the Vatican library, and was at that time in the French capital. By the aid of this he was enabled to fill various <seg lang="la">lacunae</seg>, and to reestablish various passages which had been altered in all the other manuscripts and in all the editions anterior to his own. The best recent edition is that of Heiberg, 5 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1883-88)</bibl>.

<head orig="Eudocia">Eudocia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐδοκία</foreign>). (1) A Roman empress, wife to Theodosius the Younger. Her original name was Athenaïs, and she was the daughter of Leontius, an Athenian philosopher; but on her marriage she embraced Christianity, and received the baptismal name of Eudocia. She was a woman of beauty and talent. She versified several books of the Old Testament, and wrote several paraphrases on some of the Jewish prophets; but became suspected by her husband of conjugal infidelity, and, being degraded, she was allowed to seek a refuge in the Holy Land. Here she devoted herself to religious studies, but the jealousy of her suspicious husband still pursued her; and having learned that two priests, whom she had chosen as the companions of her exile, were accustomed to pay her frequent visits and were loaded by her with presents, Theodosius sent Saturninus, one of the officers of his court, to Jerusalem, who put to death the two priests without even the formality of a trial. Irritated at this new insult, Eudocia caused Saturninus to be slain—a deed more likely to darken than avenge her innocence. The emperor contented himself with depriving her of all the badges of her rank, and reducing her to the conditions of a private individual. She lived twenty years after this event, in the bitterest penitence, and died at the age of sixty-seven years, in A.D. 460.</p>
 <p>The principal work ascribed by some to Eudocia is <title>Homerocentra</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὁμηρόκεντρα</foreign>), or a life of the Saviour, in 2443 hexameters, formed from verses and hemistichs selected from the poems of Homer. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscento">Cento</ref>.) Others, however, make Pelagius, surnamed Patricius, who lived in the fifth century, its author. Eudocia left, also, a poem on the martyrdom of Cyprian. The best edition of the <title>Homerocentra</title> is that of Teucher <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1798)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) The Younger, daughter of the preceding and of Theodosius II., married Valentinian III. After <cb /> the assassination of her husband by Petronius Maximus, she was obliged to marry the usurper. Eudocia, out of indignation and revenge, called in Genseric, king of the Vandals, who came to Italy, plundered Rome, and carried Eudocia with him to Africa. Some years afterwards she was sent back to Constantinople, where she died, A.D. 462.</p>

Three years after, Michael, her son, by means of a revolt, was proclaimed emperor, and caused his mother to be shut up in a convent, where she spent the rest of her life. She left a treatise on the genealogies of the gods and heroes, which displays an extensive acquaintance with the subject.

<head orig="Euhemĕrus">Euhemerus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐήμερος</foreign>). A native of Messena, as is generally supposed, though perhaps of Messana. Being sent on a voyage of discovery by Cassander, king of Macedon, about B.C. 316, he came, as he himself asserted, to an island called Panchaea, in the capital of which, Panara, he found a temple of the Triphylian Zeus, where stood a column inscribed with a register of the births and deaths of many of the gods. Among these he specified Uranus, his sons Pan and Cronos, and his daughters Rhea and Demeter; as also Zeus, Heré, and Poseidon, 
<pb n="632" /><cb />
 who were the offspring of Cronos. Accordingly, the design of Euhemerus was to show, by investigating their actions and recording the places of their births and burials, that the mythological deities were mere mortal men, raised to the rank of gods on account of the benefits which they had conferred upon mankind. Ennius translated this celebrated work of Euhemerus, which was entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἱερὰ Ἀναγραφή</foreign>. The translation, as well as the original work, excepting some fragments, is lost; but many particulars concerning Euhemerus and the object of his history are mentioned in a fragment of Diodorus Siculus, preserved by Eusebius. Some quotations have also been saved by St. Augustine, and others have been made by Lactantius in his treatise <title>De Falsa Religione</title> (i. 11). This work was undoubtedly a covert attack on the established religion of the Greeks.

<div2 id="crosseumenides" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eumenĭdes">Eumenides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐμενίδες</foreign>), also called <ref type="cross" target="crosserinyes">Erinyes</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐρινύες</foreign>), and by the Romans Furiae or Dirae. Originally a personification of curses pronounced upon a guilty criminal. The name Erinys, which is the more ancient one, was derived by the Greeks from the verb <foreign lang="greek">ἐρίνω</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐρευνάω</foreign>, “I hunt down,” or “persecute,” or from the Arcadian word <foreign lang="greek">ἐρινύω</foreign>, “I am angry”; so that the Erinyes were either the angry goddesses, or the goddesses who hunt or search for the criminal. The name Eumenides, which signifies “the well-meaning,” or “soothed goddesses,” is a mere euphemism, because people dreaded to call these fearful goddesses by their real name; and it was said to have been first given them after the acquittal of Orestes by the court of the Areopagus, when the anger of the Erinyes had become soothed. It was by a similar euphemism that at Athens the Erinyes were called <foreign lang="greek">σεμναὶ θεαί</foreign>, or the Revered Goddesses.</p>
 <p>In the sense of “curse” or “curses,” the word Erinys or Erinyes is often used in the Homeric poems, and Aeschylus calls the Eumenides <foreign lang="greek">Ἀραί</foreign>, that is, curses. According to the Homeric notion, the Erinyes, whom the poet conceives as distinct beings, are reckoned among those who inhabit Erebus, where they rest until some curse pronounced upon a criminal calls them to life and activity. The crimes which they punish are disobedience towards parents, violation of the respect due to old age, perjury, murder, violation of the laws of hospitality, and improper conduct towards suppliants. The notion which is the foundation of the belief in the Eumenides seems to be that a parent's curse takes from him upon whom it is pronounced all peace of mind, destroys the happiness of his family, and prevents his being blessed with children. As the Eumenides not only punished crimes after death, but during life on earth, they were regarded also as goddesses of fate, who, together with Zeus and the Moerae or Parcae, led such men as were doomed to suffer into misery and misfortunes. In the same capacity they also prevented man from obtaining too much knowledge of the future. Homer does not mention any particular names for the Erinyes, nor does he seem to know of any definite number. Hesiod, who is likewise silent upon these points, calls the Erinyes the daughters of Gaea, who conceived them in the drops of blood that fell upon her from the body of Uranus. Epimenides called them the daughters of Cronos and Euonymé, and sisters of the Moerae; Aeschylus calls them the daughters of Night; and Sophocles, of Scotos (Darkness) and Gaea. In the Greek tragedians, with whom (e. g. in the <title>Eumenides</title> of Aeschylus) the number of these goddesses is not limited to a few, no particular name of any one Erinys is yet mentioned, but they appear in the same capacity, and as the avengers of the same crimes, as before. They are sometimes identified with the Poenae, though their sphere of action is wider than that of the Poenae. From their hunting down and persecuting the accursed criminal, Aeschylus calls them <foreign lang="greek">κύνες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">κυνηγέτιδες</foreign>. No prayer, no sacrifice, and no tears can move them, or protect 
<pb n="633" /><cb /> the object of their persecution; and when they fear lest the criminal should escape them, they call in the assistance of Diké, with whom they are closely connected, the maintenance of <figure id="fig.00633">
<head orig="Eumenides. (From a Painted Vase.)">Eumenides. (From a Painted Vase.)</head>
</figure> strict justice being their only object. The Erinyes were more ancient divinities than the Olympian gods, and were therefore not under the rule of Zeus, though they honoured and esteemed him; and they dwelt in the deep darkness of Tartarus, dreaded by gods and men. Their appearance is described by Aeschylus as Gorgo-like, their bodies covered with black, serpents twined in their hair, and blood dripping from their eyes; Euripides and other later poets describe them as winged beings. The appearance they have in Aeschylus was more or less retained by the poets of later times; but they gradually assumed the character of goddesses who punished crimes after death, and seldom appeared on earth. On the stage, however, and in works of art, their fearful appearance was greatly softened down, for they were represented as maidens of a grave and solemn mien, in the richly adorned attire of huntresses, with a band of serpents around their heads, and serpents or torches in their hands. With later writers, though not always, the number of Eumenides is limited to three, and their names are <ref type="cross" target="crosstisiphone">Tisiphŏné</ref>, <ref type="cross" target="crossalecto">Alecto</ref>, and <ref type="cross" target="crossmegaera">Megaera</ref>. At Athens there were statues of only two. The sacrifices which were offered to them consisted of black sheep and <foreign lang="greek">νηφάλια</foreign>—i. e. a drink of honey mixed with water. Among the objects sacred to them we hear of white turtledoves and the narcissus. They were worshipped at Athens, where they had a sanctuary and a grotto near the Areopagus; their statues, however, had nothing formidable, and a festival, Eumenidia, was there celebrated in their honour. Another sanctuary, with a grove which no one was allowed to enter, existed at Colonus. Under the name of <foreign lang="greek">Μανίαι</foreign>, they were worshipped at Megalopolis.

After his birth he was thrown by his mother into the sea, but his father rescued him and brought him to Aethiopia, to his daughter Benthesicymé. When he was grown up, Endius, the husband of Benthesicymé, gave him one of his daughters in marriage, but he desired the other as well, and was accordingly banished, and came with his son Ismarus or Immaradus to the Thracian king Tegyrius in Boeotia. As successor to this king he marched to the assistance of his friends the Eleusinians against the Athenian Erechtheus, but was slain with his son. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosserechtheus">Erechtheus</ref>.) According to another story, Immaradus and Erechtheus both fell, and the contending parties agreed that the Eleusinians should submit to the Athenians, but should retain the exclusive superintendence of the mysteries of Eleusis, of which Eumolpus was accounted the founder (Thucyd. ii. 15; Isocrat. <title>Panath.</title> 78). He was also spoken of as a writer of consecrational hymns, and as having discovered the art of cultivating the vines and trees in general.

He wrote various poems, entitled <title>Hesiod, Alexander, Arius, Apollodorus</title>, etc. His <title>Mopsopia</title> or <title>Miscellanies</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Μοψοπία ἤ ἄτακτα</foreign>) was a collection, in five books, of fables and histories relative to Attica, a very learned work, but rivalling in obscurity the <title>Cassandra</title> of Lycophron. The fifth book bore the title of <title>Chiliad</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Χιλιάς</foreign>), either because it consisted of a thousand verses, or because it contained the ancient oracles that referred to a period of a thousand years. Perhaps, however, each of the five books contained a thousand verses, for the passage of Suidas respecting this writer is somewhat obscure and defective, and Eudocia, in the “Garden of Violets,” speaks of a fifth Chiliad, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Χρησμῶν</foreign>, “Of Oracles.” Quintilian recommends the reading of this poet, and Vergil is said to have esteemed his productions very highly. A passage in the tenth eclogue (v. 50 foll.) and a remark made by Servius (<title>Ad Eclog.</title> vi. 72) have led Heyne to suppose that C. Cornelius Gallus , the friend of Vergil, had translated Euphorion into Latin verse. This poet was one of the favourite authors of the emperor Tiberius, one of those whom he imitated, and whose busts he placed in his library. The fragments of Euphorion were collected and published by Meineke in his work <bibl default="NO"><title>De Euphorionis Chalc. Vita et Scriptis</title> (1823)</bibl>, and in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Analecta Alexandrina</title> (Berlin, 1843)</bibl>. See also <bibl default="NO">Kock, <title>Frag. Com.

<head orig="Euphrātes">Euphrates</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐφράτης</foreign>). One of the largest and best-known rivers of Asia. The Euphrates rises near Arzé, the modern Erzeroum. Its source is among mountains, which Strabo makes to be a part of the most northern branch of Taurus. At first it is a very inconsiderable stream, and flows to the west, until, encountering the mountains of Cappadocia, it turns to the south, and, after flowing a short distance, receives its southern arm, a large river coming from the east and rising in the southern declivity of the range of Mount Ararat. This southern arm of the Euphrates is the Arsanias, according to Mannert, and is the river which the 10,000 crossed in their retreat ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 4. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Anab.</title>iv. 5</bibl>), and of which mention is made by Pliny in reference to the campaigns of Corbulo. The Euphrates, by this accession of waters, becoming a very large stream, descends rapidly in a bending course, nearly west-southwest to the vicinity of Samosata. The range of Amanus here preventing its farther progress in this direction, it turns off to the southeast, a course which it next pursues, with some variation, until it reaches Circesium. To the south of this place it enters the immense plains of Sennar, but is forced to run again to the southeast and approach the Tigris. The union of these rivers finally takes place near Coma. The river formed by their junction is called Shat-alArab, or River of Arabia. It has three principal mouths, besides a small outlet. The whole length of the Euphrates, including the Shat-al-Arab, is 1700 miles. Its name is the Greek form of the original appellation Phrat, which signifies fruitful or fertilizing. The Oriental name is sometimes also written Perath, as in Gen. ii. 14, 15, 18, and Josh. i. 4. The Persian form is <title>Ufratu;</title> Syriac, <title>Ephrat;</title> Arabic, <title>Furat.</title> On the condition and topography of the Euphrates, see <bibl default="NO">Aiusworth, <title>The Euphrates Expedition</title> (1888)</bibl>. <cb />

<head orig="Eupŏlis">Eupolis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὔπολις</foreign>). A writer of the Old Comedy, who was born at Athens about the year B.C. 446. He was therefore a contemporary of Aristophanes, who, in all probability, was born a year or two after. Eupolis is supposed to have exhibited plays for the first time in B.C. 429. In B.C. 425 he was third with his <foreign lang="greek">Νουμηνίαι</foreign>, when Cratinus was second and Aristophanes first. In B.C. 421 he brought out his <foreign lang="greek">Μαρικᾶς</foreign> and his <foreign lang="greek">Κόλακες</foreign>, and his <foreign lang="greek">Αὐτόλυκος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ἀστρατευτοί</foreign> the following year (Schol. on <title>Nub.</title> 552, 592; Schol. on <title>Pac.</title> 803). The titles of more than twenty of his comedies have been collected. A few fragments remain. Eupolis was a bold and severe satirist on the vices of his day and city. Persius (i. 124) terms him <seg lang="la">iratus</seg> (cf.  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 4. 1" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 4. 1</bibl> foll.). In the <foreign lang="greek">Μαρικᾶς</foreign> he attacked Hyperbolus ( <title>Nub.</title> 551); in the <foreign lang="greek">Αὐτόλυκος</foreign> he ridiculed the handsome pancratiast of that name; in the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀστράτευτοι</foreign> he lashed the useless and cowardly citizens of Athens, and denounced Melanthus as an epicure. In the <foreign lang="greek">Βάπται</foreign> he inveighed against the effeminacy of his countrymen. In his <foreign lang="greek">Λακεδαίμονες</foreign> he assailed Cimon, accusing him, among other charges, of an unpatriotic bias towards everything Spartan. (See Plut. <bibl n="Nep. Cim. 16" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cim.</title>16</bibl>, who says that this play had a great influence on the public feeling.) Aristophanes seems to have been on bad terms with Eupolis, whom he charges with having pillaged the materials for his <foreign lang="greek">Μαρικᾶς</foreign> from the <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππῆς</foreign> (<title>Nubes</title>, 551 foll.), and with making scurrilous jokes on his premature baldness (Schol. <title>Ad Nub.</title> 532). Eupolis appears to have been a warm admirer of Pericles as a statesman and a man, as it was reasonable that such a comedian should be, if it be true that he owed his unrestrained license of speech to the patronage of that celebrated statesman. His death was generally ascribed to the vengeance of Alcibiades, whom he had lampooned, probably in the <foreign lang="greek">Βάπται</foreign> ( <title>Ad Att.</title> vi. 1). By his orders, according to the common account, Eupolis was thrown overboard during the passage of the Athenian armament to Sicily (B.C. 415). Cicero, however, calls this story a popular error; since Eratosthenes, the Alexandrian librarian, had shown that several comedies were composed by Eupolis some time after the date assigned to this pseudoassassination. His tomb, too, according to Pausanias, was erected on the banks of the Asopus by the Sicyonians, which makes it most probable that this was the place of his death. The fragments of Eupolis will be found in Meineke's <title>Fragmenta Com. Graec.</title> i. pp. 104-146; and ii. pp. 426-579 <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1839-47)</bibl>; and are separately edited by Runkel <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1829)</bibl>.

<head orig="Euripĭdes">Euripides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐριπίδης</foreign>). (1) A celebrated Athenian tragic poet, son of Mnesarchus and Clito. He was born B.C. 480, in Salamis, on the very day of the Grecian victory near that island. His mother, Clito, had been sent over to Salamis, with the other Athenian women, when Attica was given up to the invading army of Xerxes; and the name of the 
<pb n="636" /><cb />
 poet, which is formed like a patronymic from the Euripus, the scene of the first successful resistance to the Persian navy, shows that the minds of his parents were full of the stirring events of that momentous crisis. Aristophanes repeatedly imputes meanness of extraction, by the mother's side, to Euripides (<title>Thesmoph.</title> 386, 455; <title>Acharn.</title> 478; <title>Equit.</title> 17; <title>Ranae</title>, 840). He asserts that she was an herb-seller; and, according to Aulus Gellius (xv. 20), Theophrastus confirms the comedian's insinuations. Whatever one or both of his parents might originally have been, the costly education which the young Euripides received implies a certain degree of wealth and consequence as then at least possessed by his family. The pupil of Anaxagoras, Protagoras, and Prodicus (an instructor famous for the extravagant terms which he demanded for his lessons), could not have been the son of persons at that time very mean or poor. It is most probable, therefore, that his father was a man of <figure id="fig.00636">
<head orig="Euripides. (Naples Museum.)">Euripides. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> property, and made a <hi rend="italic">mésalliance.</hi> In early life we are told that his father made Euripides direct his attention chiefly to gymnastic exercises, and that, in his seventeenth year, he was crowned in the Eleusinian and Thesean contests (Aul. Gell. xv. 20). Even at this early age he is said to have attempted dramatic composition. He seems also to have cultivated a natural taste for painting, and some of his pictures were long afterwards preserved at Megara. At length, quitting the gymnasium, he applied himself to philosophy and literature. Under the celebrated rhetorician Prodicus, one of the instructors of Pericles, he acquired that oratorical skill for which his dramas are so remarkably distinguished. Quintilian, in comparing Sophocles with Euripides, strongly recommends the latter to the young pleader as an excellent model. Cicero, too, was a great admirer of Euripides. From Anaxagoras, Euripides imbibed those philosophical notions which are occasionally <cb /> brought forward in his works, and for which reference may be made to the monograph of Parmentier, <bibl default="NO"><title>Euripide et Anaxagore</title> (Paris, 1893)</bibl>. Here, too, Pericles was his fellow-disciple. With Socrates, who had studied under the same master, Euripides was on terms of the closest intimacy, and from him he derived those maxims so frequently interwoven into his dramas that Socrates was suspected of largely assisting the tragedian in their composition.</p>
 <p>Euripides began his public career as a dramatic writer in B.C. 455, the twenty-fifth year of his age. On this occasion he was the third with a play called the <title>Pleiades.</title> In B.C. 441, he won the prize. In B.C. 431, he was third with the <title>Medea</title>, the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the <title>Dictys</title>, and the <title>Theristae</title>, a satyric drama. His competitors were Euphorion and Sophocles. He was first with the <title>Hippolytus</title>, B.C. 428, the year of his master's (Anaxagoras's) death; second, B.C. 415, with the <title>Alexander</title> (or <title>Paris</title>), the <title>Palamedes</title>, the <title>Troades</title>, and the <title>Sisyphus</title>, a satyric drama. It was in this contest that Xenocles was first (Aelian. <title>V. H.</title> ii. 8). Two years after this the Athenians sustained the total loss of their armament before Syracuse. In his narration of this disaster, Plutarch gives an anecdote (<title>Nicias</title>) which, if true, bears a splendid testimony to the high reputation which Euripides then enjoyed. Those among the captives, he tells us, who could repeat any portion of that poet's works were treated with kindness, and even set at liberty. The same author also informs us that Euripides honoured the soldiers who had fallen in that siege with a funeral poem, two lines of which he has preserved. The <title>Andromeda</title> was exhibited B.C. 412; the <title>Orestes</title>, B.C. 408.</p>
 <p>Soon after this time the poet retired into Magnesia, and from thence into Macedonia, to the court of Archelaüs. As in the case of Aeschylus, the motives for this self-exile are obscure and uncertain. We know, indeed, that Athens was by no means the most favourable residence for distinguished literary merit. Report, too, pronounced Euripides unhappy in his own family. His first wife, Melito, he divorced for adultery; and in his second, Choerilé, he was not more fortunate. To the poet's unhappiness in his matrimonial connections Aristophanes refers in his <title>Ranae</title> (1045 foll.). Envy and enmity among his fellow-citizens, infidelity and domestic vexations at home, would prove powerful inducements to the poet to accept the invitations of Archelaüs. Perhaps, too, a prosecution in which he became involved, on a charge of impiety, grounded upon a line in the Hippolytus (Aristot. <bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 3. 15" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title>iii. 15</bibl>), might have had some share in producing this determination to quit Athens; nor ought we to omit that, in all likelihood, his political sentiments may have exposed him to continual danger. In Macedonia he is said to have written a play in honour of Archelaüs, and to have inscribed it with his patron's name, who was so much pleased with the manners and ability of his guest as to appoint him one of his ministers. He composed in this same country also some other dramatic pieces, in one of which (the <title>Bacchae</title>) he seems to have been inspired by the wild scenery of the land to which he had come. No further particulars are recorded of Euripides, except a few apocryphal anecdotes and apophthegms. His death is said to have been, like that of Aeschylus, of an extraordinary kind. Either from chance or 
<pb n="637" /><cb />
 malice the aged dramatist was exposed, according to the common account, to the attack of some ferocious hounds, and was by them so dreadfully mangled as to expire soon afterwards, in his seventy-fifth year. This story, however, is clearly a fabrication, for Aristophanes, in the <title>Ranae</title>, would certainly have alluded to the manner of his death had there been anything remarkable in it. He died B.C. 406 (Clinton, <title>Fast. Hellen.</title> i. 81). The Athenians entreated Archelaüs to send the body to the poet's native city for interment. The request was refused, and, with every demonstration of grief and respect, Euripides was buried at Pella. A cenotaph, however, was erected to his memory at Athens.</p>
 <p>We have some cutting sayings of Sophocles concerning Euripides, although the former was so void of all the jealousy of an artist that he mourned over the death of his rival; and, in a piece which he shortly after brought upon the stage, did not allow his actors the ornament of a garland. The jeering attacks of Aristophanes are well known, but have not always been properly estimated and understood. Aristotle, too, brings forward many important causes for blame; and when he calls Euripides “the most tragic of poets” ( <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 13. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>xiii. 10</bibl>), he by no means ascribes to him the greatest perfection in the tragic art generally; but he alludes, by this phrase, to the effect which is produced by his dramatic catastrophes. In Euripides we no longer find the essence of ancient tragedy pure and unmixed; its characteristic features are already partly effaced. These consisted principally in the idea of destiny which reigns in them, in ideal representation, and the importance of the chorus. The idea of destiny had, indeed, come down to him from his predecessors as his inheritance, and a belief in it is inculcated by him, according to the custom of the tragedians; but still, in Euripides, destiny is seldom considered as the invisible spirit of all poetry, the fundamental thought of the tragic world. On the other hand, he derived it from the regions of infinity, and, in his writings, inevitable necessity often degenerates into the caprice of chance. Hence he can no longer direct it to its proper aim—namely, that of elevating, by its contrast, the moral free-will of man. Very few of his dramas depend on a constant combat against the dictates of destiny, or an equally heroic subjection to them. His men, in general, suffer, because they must, and not because they are willing. The contrasted subordination of idea, loftiness of character and passion, which in Sophocles, as well as in the graphic art of the Greeks, we find observed in this order, are in him exactly reversed. In his plays passion is the most powerful; his secondary care is for character; and if these endeavours leave him sufficient room, he seeks now and then to bring in greatness and dignity, but more frequently amiability. Euripides has, according to the doctrine of Aristotle ( <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 15. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>xv. 7</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Poet. 26. 31" default="NO" valid="yes"> Poet., xxvi. 31</bibl>), frequently represented his personages as bad without any necessity—for example, Menelaüs in the <title>Orestes.</title> More especially, it is by no means his object to represent the race of heroes as pre-eminent above the present race by their mighty stature, but he rather takes pains to fill up the chasm between his contemporaries and the olden time, and reveal the gods and heroes of the other side in their undress. This is what Sophocles meant when he said that he himself represented men as they should be, Euripides as <cb /> they were. It seems to be a design of Euripides always to remind his spectators, “See, these beings were men; they had just such weaknesses, and acted from exactly the same motives as yourselves, and as the meanest among you does.” In other words, Euripides is the first of the realists among the Greeks.</p>
 <p>In his dramas the chorus is generally an unessential ornament, its songs are often altogether episodical, without reference to the action. The ancient comic writers enjoyed the privilege of sometimes making the chorus address the audience in their own name, this being called a Parabasis. Although it by no means belongs to tragedy, yet Euripides, according to the testimony of Iulius Pollux, often employed it, and so far forgot himself in it that in the <title>Danaïdes</title> he made the chorus, consisting of women, use grammatical forms which belonged to the masculine gender alone. In the music of the accompaniments he adopted all the innovations of which <ref type="cross" target="crosstimotheus">Timotheus</ref> (q.v.) was the author, and selected those measures which are most suitable to the sensuous nature of his poetry. He acted in a similar way as regarded prosody; the construction of his verses is rather florid, and approaches irregularity. He strives after effect in a degree which can not be conceded even to a dramatic poet. Thus, for example, he seldom lets any opportunity escape of having his personages seized with sudden and groundless terror; his old men always complain of the infirmities of old age, and are particularly given to mount, with tottering knees, the ascent from the orchestra to the stage, which frequently represented the declivity of a mountain, while they lament their wretchedness. His object throughout is emotion, for the sake of which he not only offends against ancient decorum, but sacrifices the symmetry of his plays. He likes to reduce his heroes to a state of beggary; makes them suffer hunger and want; and brings them on the stage with all the external signs of indigence, covered with rags, as Aristophanes so humourously throws in his teeth in the <title>Acharnians</title> (410-448).</p>
 <p>Euripides, as already stated, had studied philosophy, and prided himself upon his familiarity with philosophical doctrine. Hence, as contrasted with his two dramatic predecessors, Aeschylus and Sophocles, his rationalistic method of treatment seemed to his audiences startling and almost impious. His allegorical interpretations must often have had a flavour of sacrilege about them, and the whole spirit and temper of his plays were an embodiment of the “higher criticism” of the day. The Athenians were prone to identify the sentiments of his characters with those of the author himself. It is related of him that he made Bellerophon come on the stage with a panegyric on riches, in which he preferred them before every domestic joy; and said, at last, “If Aphrodité (who had the epithet of ‘golden’) shone like gold, she would indeed deserve the love of men” ( <title>Epist.</title> 115). The audience, enraged at this, raised a great tumult, and were proceeding to stone the orator as well as the poet. Euripides, on this, rushed forward and exclaimed, “Wait patiently till the end; he will fare accordingly.” Thus, also, he is said to have excused himself against the accusation that his Ixion spoke too abominably and blasphemously, by replying that, in return, he had not concluded the piece without making him revolve on the wheel. He has also great command of that sophistry 
<pb n="638" /><cb /> of the passions which gives things only one appearance. The following verse (<title>Hippol.</title> 608) is notorious for its expression of what casuists call mental reservation: <lb />“My tongue took an oath, but my mind is unsworn.”</p>
 <p>In the connection in which this verse is spoken, it may indeed be justified, as far as regards the reason for which Aristophanes ridicules it in so many ways; but still the formula is pernicious on account of the turn which may be given it. Another sentiment of Euripides (<title>Phoeniss.</title> 534), “It is worth while committing injustice for the sake of empire; in other things it is proper to be just,” was continually in the mouth of Caesar, in order to make a wrong application of it ( <title>Iul.</title> 30). Seductive enticements to the enjoyment of sensual love were another article of accusation against Euripides among the ancients. Thus, for example, Hecuba, in order to incite Agamemnon to punish Polymnestor, reminds him of the joys Cassandra had afforded him; who, having been taken in war, was his slave, according to the law of the heroic ages: she is willing to purchase revenge for a murdered son by consenting to and ratifying the degradation of a daughter who is still alive. This poet was the first to take for the principal subject of a drama the wild passion of a Medea or the unnatural love of a Phaedra, as, otherwise, it may be easily understood, from the manners of the ancients, why love, which among them was far less ennobled by delicate feelings, played merely a subordinate part in their earlier tragedies. Notwithstanding the importance imparted to female characters, he brings out a multitude of sayings concerning the weaknesses of the female sex and the superiority of men, as well as a great deal drawn from his own experience in domestic relations. A cutting saying, as well as an epigram, of Sophocles have been handed down to us by Athenaeus, in which he explains the pretended hatred of Euripides for women by supposing that he had the opportunity of learning their frailty through his own unhallowed desires.</p>
 <p>That independent freedom in the method of treating the story, which was one of the privileges of the tragic art, frequently, in Euripides, became caprice. It is well known that the fables of Hyginus, which differ so much from the relations of other writers, are partly extracted from his plays. As he often overturned what had hitherto been well known and generally received, he was obliged to use prologues, in which he announces the situation of affairs according to his acceptation, and makes known the course of events. (Compare the amusing scene in Aristophanes, <title>Ranae</title>, 1177 foll., and Porson's explanation of the employment of such prologues by Euripides, <title>Praelect. in Eurip.</title> p. 8 foll.). These prologues make the beginnings of the plays of Euripides monotonous, and produce the appearance of deficiency of art.</p>
 <p>The style of Euripides is, on the whole, not sufficiently compressed, and it has neither the dignity and energy of Aeschylus nor the chaste grace of Sophocles. In his expressions he frequently aims at the extraordinary and strange, and, on the other hand, loses himself in commonplace. For these reasons, as well as on account of his almost ludicrous delineation of many characteristic peculiarities (such as the clumsy deportment of Pentheus in a female garb, when befooled by Bacchus [<bibl n="Eur. Ba. 782" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Bacchae</title>, 782</bibl> foll.], <cb /> or the greediness of Heracles [<title>Alcestis</title>, 764 foll.], and his boisterous demands on the hospitality of Admetus), Euripides was a forerunner of the New Comedy. Menander, in fact, expressed admiration for him, and declared himself to be his scholar; and there is a fragment of Philemon, full of extravagant admiration of him. “If the dead,” he says, or makes one of his personages say, “really possessed sensation, as some suppose, I would hang myself in order to see Euripides.”</p>
 <p>Of the 120 dramas which Euripides is said to have composed, we have remaining in their complete form only eighteen tragedies and one satyric piece. The following are the titles and subjects: (1) <foreign lang="greek">Ἑκάβη</foreign>, <title>Hecuba.</title> The sacrifice of Polyxena, whom the Greeks immolate to the shade of Achilles, and the vengeance which Hecuba, doubly unfortunate in having been reduced to captivity and deprived of her children, takes upon Polymnestor, the murderer of her son Polydorus, form the subject of this tragedy. The scene is laid in the Grecian camp in the Thracian Chersonesus. The shade of Polydorus, whose body remains without the rites of sepulture, has the prologue assigned it. Ennius and L. Attius, and in modern times Erasmus, have translated this play into Latin verse.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Ὀρέστης</foreign>, <title>Orestes.</title> The scene of this play is laid at Argos, the seventh day after the murder of Clytaemnestra. It is on this day that the people, in full assembly, are to sit in judgment upon Orestes and Electra. The only hope of the accused is in Menelaüs, who has just arrived; but this chief, who secretly aims at the succession, stirs up the people in private to pronounce sentence of condemnation against the parricides. The sentence is accordingly pronounced, but the execution of it is left to the culprits themselves. They meditate taking vengeance by slaying Helen; but this princess is saved by the intervention of Apollo, who brings about a double marriage by uniting Orestes with Hermioné, the daughter of Helen, and Electra with Pylades. Some commentators think that they recognize the portrait of Socrates in that of the simple and virtuous citizen who, in the assembly of the people, undertakes the defence of Orestes. This play is ascribed by some to Euripides the Younger, nephew of the former.</p>
 <p>(3) <foreign lang="greek">Φοινίσσαι</foreign>, <title>Phoenissae.</title> The subject of this piece is the death of Eteocles and Polynices. The chorus is composed of young Phoenician women, sent, according to the custom established by Agenor, to the city of Thebes, in order to be consecrated to the service of the temple at Delphi. The prologue is assigned to Iocasta. The subject of the <title>Phoenissae</title> is that also of the <title>Thebaïs</title> of Seneca. Statius has likewise imitated it in his epic poem.</p>
 <p>(4) <foreign lang="greek">Μήδεια</foreign>, <title>Medea.</title> The vengeance taken by Medea on the ungrateful Iason, to whom she has sacrificed all, and who, on his arrival at Corinth, abandons her for a royal bride, forms the subject of this tragedy. What constitutes the principal charm of the play is the simplicity and clearness of the action, and the force and natural cast of the characters. The exposition of the plot is made in a monologue by the nurse: the chorus is composed of Corinthian women. It is asserted that Euripides gave to the world two editions of this tragedy, and that, in the first, the children of Medea were put to death by the Corinthians, while in the second, which has come down to us, it is their mother herself who slays them. According to this hypothesis, the 
<pb n="639" /><cb /> 1378th verse and those immediately following, in which Medea says that she will impose on Corinth, contemptuously styled by her the land of Sisyphus, an expiatory festival for this crime, have been retained by mistake in the revision in which they should have disappeared. Medea has no expiation to demand of the Corinthians, if they are not guilty of the murder of her sons. Aelian informs us (<title>V. H.</title> v. 21) that the Corinthians prevailed upon Euripides to alter the tradition in question. According to others, they purchased this compliance for the sum of five talents.</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππόλυτος στεφανοφόρος</foreign>, <title>Hippolytus Coronifer</title>, “Hippolytus Crowned.” The subject of this tragedy is the same with that which Racine has taken for the basis of his <title>Phèdre</title>, a subject eminently tragical. It presents to our view a weak woman, the victim of the resentment of Aphrodité, who has inspired her with a criminal passion. An object of horror to him whom she loves, and not daring to reveal her own shame, she dies, after having compelled Theseus, by her misrepresentations, to become the destroyer of his own son. The title of this tragedy is probably derived from the crown which Hippolytus offers to Artemis. Euripides at first gave it the name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἱππόλυτος καλυπτόμενος</foreign>. He afterwards retouched it, and, changing the catastrophe and the title, reproduced it in the year that Pericles died. It gained the prize over the pieces of Iophon and Ion, which had competed with it in the contest. It is sometimes cited under the title of the <title>Phaedra</title>, and the celebrated chef-d'oeuvre of Racine is an imitation of it, as is also the tragedy of Seneca.</p>
 <p>(6) <foreign lang="greek">Ἄλκηστις</foreign>, <title>Alcestis.</title> The subject of this tragedy is moral and affecting. It is a wife who dies for the sake of prolonging her husband's existence. Its object is to show that conjugal affection and an observance of the rites of hospitality are not suffered to go without their reward. Heracles, whom Admetus had kindly received while unfortunate, having learned that Alcestis, the wife of the monarch, had consummated her mournful sacrifice, seeks her in the shades, and restores her to her husband. The play, by reason of its happy ending, is hardly to be considered a tragedy, but more of a tragi-comedy. The story of Alcestis has inspired a number of fine poems in English literature, notably <title>Balaustion's Adventure</title>, by Robert Browning. Others who have treated the same theme are William Morris, W. S. Landor, Palgrave, Mrs. Hemans, and W. M. W. Call.</p>
 <p>(7) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνδρομάχη</foreign>, <title>Andromaché.</title> The death of the son of Achilles, whom Orestes slays, after having carried off from him Hermioné, forms the subject of the piece. The scene is laid in Thetidium, a city of Thessaly, near Pharsalus. Some have asserted that the aim of Euripides in writing this tragedy was to render odious the law of the Athenians which permitted bigamy.</p>
 <p>(8) <foreign lang="greek">Ἱκέτιδες</foreign>, <title>Supplices</title>, “The Suppliants.” The scene of this tragedy is laid in front of the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, whither the Argive women, whose husbands have perished before Thebes, have followed their king Adrastus, in the hope of persuading Theseus to take up arms in their behalf, and obtain the rites of sepulture for their dead, whose bodies were withheld by the Thebans. Theseus yields to their request and promises his assistance. In exhibiting this play in the fourteenth year of the Peloponnesian War, Euripides wished, it is said, to detach the Argives from the Spartan cause. His attempt, however, failed, and the treaty was signed by which Mantinea was sacrificed to the <cb /> ambition of Lacedaemon.</p>
 <p>(9) <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφιγένεια ἡ ἐν Αὐλίδι</foreign>, <title>Iphigenia in Aulide</title>, “Iphigenia at Aulis.” The subject of this tragedy is the intended sacrifice of Iphigenia, and her rescue by Artemis, who substitutes another victim. It is the only one of the plays of Euripides that has no prologue, for it is well known that the <title>Rhesus</title>, which also lacks it, had one formerly.</p>
 <p>(10) <foreign lang="greek">Ἰφιγένεια ἡ ἐν Ταύροις</foreign>, <title>Iphigenia in Tauris</title>, “Iphigenia among the Tauri.” The daughter of Agamemnon, rescued by Artemis from the knife of the sacrificer, and transported to Tauris, there serves the goddess as a priestess in her temple. Orestes has been cast on the inhospitable shores of this country, along with his friend Pylades, and by the laws of the Tauri they must be sacrificed to Artemis. Recognized by his sister at the fatal moment, Orestes conducts her back to their common country. A monologue by Iphigenia occupies the place of a prologue and exposition. The scene where Iphigenia and her brother became known to each other is of a deep and touching interest, and has been imitated by Guimond de la Touche and Goethe.</p>
 <p>(11) <foreign lang="greek">Τρώαδες</foreign>, <title>Troades</title>, “The Trojan women.” The action of this piece is prior to that of the <title>Hecuba.</title> The scene is laid in the Grecian camp, under the walls of Troy, which has fallen into the hands of the foe. A body of female captives have been distributed by lot among the victors. Agamemnon has reserved Cassandra for himself; Polyxena has been immolated to the manes of Achilles; Andromaché has fallen to Neoptolemus, Hecuba to Odysseus. The object of the poet is to show us in Hecuba a mother bowed down by misfortune. The Greeks destroy Astyanax, and his mangled body is brought in to the mother of Hector, his own parent being by this time carried away in the train of Neoptolemus. Ilium is then given as a prey to the flames. This succession of horrors passes in mournful review before the eyes of the spectator; yet there is no unity of action to constitute a subject for the piece, and consequently the play has no dénouement. Poseidon appears in the prologue. Seneca and M. de Chateaubrun have imitated this tragedy.</p>
 <p>(12) <foreign lang="greek">Βάκχαι</foreign>, <title>Bacchae</title>, “The female Bacchanalians,” sometimes quoted as the <title>Pentheus</title>, for Euripides seldom names his plays after the chorus. The arrival of Bacchus at Thebes and the death of Pentheus, who is torn in pieces by his mother and sister form the subject of this drama, in which Bacchus opens the scene and makes himself known to the spectators. The <title>Bacchae</title> is regarded by Jebb as “in its own kind, by far the most splendid work of Euripides that we possess.” It is a succession of rich paintings, of tragic situaations, of brilliant verses, unique among existing Greek plays in picturesque splendour. The spectacle which this tragedy presented must have been at once imposing and well calculated to keep alive curiosity. Some have held that the play is a recantation by the poet of his former irreligious sentiments; but on this see Tyrrell in the introduction to his edition of the <bibl default="NO"><title>Bacchae</title> (1892)</bibl>. It is related that the <title>Bacchae</title> was performed before Orodes and his court, when the actor sustaining the part of Agavé gave a hideous reality to the action by holding up the bloody head of the Roman general Crassus, just slain in battle by the Parthian warriors of the king (Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, iv. p. 436).</p>
 <p>(13) <foreign lang="greek">Ἡρακλεῖδαι</foreign>, <title>Heraclidae.</title> The descendants of Heracles, persecuted by Eurystheus, 
<pb n="640" /><cb /> flee for refuge to Athens, and implore the protection of that city. The Athenians lend aid, and Eurystheus becomes the victim of the vengeance he was about bringing upon them. Iolaüs, an old companion of Heracles, explains the subject to the spectators. The poet manages to impart an air of great interest to the piece.</p>
 <p>(14) <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλένη</foreign>, <title>Helena.</title> The scene is laid in Egypt, where Menelaüs, after the destruction of Troy, finds Helen, who had been detained there by Proteus, king of that country, when Paris wished to convey her to Ilium. The action passes at the isle of Pharos, where Theoclymenus, the son and successor of Proteus, keeps Helen in custody with the view of espousing her. She employs a stratagem in order to escape from his power. The dénouement of this piece resembles that of the <title>Iphigenia in Tauris.</title></p>
 <p>(15) <foreign lang="greek">Ἴων</foreign>, <title>Ion.</title> Ion, son of Apollo and Creüsa, daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens, has been brought up among the priests at Delphi. The design of Apollo is to make him pass for the son of Xuthus, who has married Creüsa. The interest of the play consists in the double danger which Creüsa and Ion run, the former of being slain by Ion and the latter of perishing by the poison prepared for him by a mother who is ignorant of his being her son. The play, however, is somewhat complicated, and has need of a long exposition, which is assigned to Hermes. The scene is laid at the entrance of Apollo's temple in Delphi, a place expressly chosen in order to give to the spectacle an air of pomp and solemnity. A religious tone, full of gravity and softness, pervades the whole piece. There is much resemblance between this tragedy and the <title>Athalie</title> of Racine.</p>
 <p>(16) <foreign lang="greek">Ἡρακλῆς μαινόμενος</foreign>, <title>Hercules furens.</title> After having killed, in his frenzy, his wife and children, Heracles proceeds to submit himself to certain expiatory ceremonies, and to seek repose at Athens. Amphitryon appears in the prologue: the scene is laid at Thebes.</p>
 <p>(17) <foreign lang="greek">Ἠλέκτρα</foreign>, <title>Electra.</title> The subject of this play has been treated also by Aeschylus and Sophocles, but by each in his peculiar way. Euripides transfers the scene from the palace of Aegisthus to the country near Argos: the exposition of the play is made by a cultivator, to whom Electra has been compelled to give her hand, but who has taken no advantage of this, but has respected in her the daughter of a royal line.</p>
 <p>(18) <foreign lang="greek">Ῥῆσος</foreign>, <title>Rhesus.</title> A subject derived from the tenth book of the <title>Iliad.</title> Some able critics have tried to prove that this piece was never written by Euripides.—<foreign lang="greek">Φαέθων</foreign>, <title>Phaëthon.</title> Of this play we have about eighty verses remaining. Clymené, the mother of Phaëthon, is the wife of Merops, king of the Ethiopians, and Phaëthon passes for the son of this prince. The young man, having conceived some doubts respecting his origin, addresses himself to the Sun. The catastrophe, which cost him his life, is well known. In the tragedy of Euripides, the body of her son is brought to Clymené, at the very moment when Merops is occupied with the task of procuring for him a bride.—<foreign lang="greek">Δανάη</foreign>, <title>Danaë.</title> Of this play we have the commencement alone, unless the sixtyfive verses, which commonly pass for a part of the prologue, are to be considered as the production of some imitator,</p>
 <p>A production deserving especial mention is the satyric drama entitled <title>Cyclops</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Κύκλωψ</foreign>). The story is drawn from the <title>Odyssey.</title> The subject <cb /> is Odysseus depriving Polyphemus of his eye, after having intoxicated him with wine. In order to connect with the story a chorus of satyrs, the poet supposes that Silenus, and his sons, the satyrs, in seeking over every sea for Bacchus, whom pirates have carried away, have been shipwrecked on the coast of Sicily, where they have fallen into the hands of Polyphemus. The Cyclops has made slaves of them, and has compelled them to tend his sheep. Odysseus, having been cast on the same coast, and having been, in like manner, made captive by Polyphemus, finds in these satyrs a willing band of accomplices. They league with him against their master, but their excessive cowardice renders them very useless auxiliaries. They profit, however, by his victory, and embark with him. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclops">Cyclops</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssatyric-drama">Satyric Drama</ref>.</p>
 <p>Of the numerous incomplete remains of Euripides that have reached us, some notice must be taken. In 1890, papyri discovered by Mr. Petrie at Tel Gurob in Egypt were found to contain fragments of a lost play of Euripides—the <title>Antiopé.</title> These fragments are reproduced and edited by Mahaffy in <bibl default="NO"><title>The Flinders Petrie Papyri</title> (Dublin, 1891)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The ancient writers cite also a poem of Euripides, <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπικήδειον</foreign>, “Funeral Hymn,” on the death of Nicias and Demosthenes, as well as of the other Athenians who perished in the disastrous expedition against Syracuse. We possess also two epigrams of Euripides, each consisting of four verses, one of which has been preserved in the Anthology and the other in Athenaeus. There have, besides, come down to us five letters, ascribed to Euripides, and written with admirable purity and simplicity of style. There are also many fragments from the lost plays of Euripides scattered among the writings of antiquity. Of these fragments Nauck collected 1117, some, however, being of doubtful authenticity. The best known of the lost plays are the <title>Andromeda, Bellerophon, Cresphontes, Erechtheus, Oedipus</title>, and <title>Telephus.</title></p>
 <p>The popularity of Euripides was very great in antiquity, as in modern times, as is shown by the number of ancient scholars who wrote commentaries on his works—among them being Dicaearchus, Callimachus, Aristophanes of Byzantium, Callistratus, and especially Didymus. An inscription at Tegea shows that his plays were represented as late as the second century B.C., winning victories at Athens, Delphi, and Dodona (<title>Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique</title>, January-April, 1893). At Rome, Euripides was translated and adapted by Ennius and by Pacuvius. In the fourth century A.D. a curious cento, the <foreign lang="greek">Χριστὸς Πάσχων</foreign> (<title>Christus Patiens</title>), of 2610 verses, was made from the plays of Euripides. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscento">Cento</ref>.) Later, Dante, who mentions neither Aeschylus nor Sophocles, praises Euripides; and from the sixteenth century to the present time he has been a popular favourite, giving inspiration to many imitators in French, English, and German.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Bibliography</hi>. — Few classical authors are so fully represented by MSS. as is Euripides. Nearly every European library of importance and of any age contains at least one, though no single MS. contains all the plays. The three plays oftenest found are the <title>Hecuba, Orestes</title>, and <title>Phoenissae</title>, owing to the fact that these three were much read in the schools under the Eastern Empire. The nine plays, <title>Hecuba, Orestes, Phoenissae, Hippolytus, Medea, Alcestis, Andromaché, Troades</title>, and <title>Rhesus</title>, are 
<pb n="641" /><cb />
 known in two “families” — one represented by the Codices Vaticanus, Hauniensis, Parisinus, and two Marciani Veneti, and the second (an inferior family) by later MSS. of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The MSS. of the first family mentioned are the oldest that we have, but are not earlier than the twelfth century. The great majority of the copies are very poor. The only MSS. containing all the nine plays mentioned above are the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Hauniensis; but of the former some pages are missing, while of the latter the text is in places so corrupt as to be of little use. The remaining ten plays are found in only two MSS.—the Palatinus (in the Vatican) and Florentinus II.—both of the fourteenth century. Three plays (the <title>Helena, Hercules Furens</title>, and <title>Electra</title>) are found only in the Codex Florentinus II. A palimpsest of the fifth or sixth century contains a part of the <title>Phaëthon</title>, and of this play an interesting “reconstruction” made by Goethe will be found in vol. xxxiii. pp. 22-43 of the 1840 edition of his works. The extaut scholia on Euripides are from the nine select plays only. The best complete edition of the scholia is that of W. Dindorf, in four vols. <bibl default="NO">(1863)</bibl>.</p>

Europa, delighted with the tameness and beauty of the animal, caressed him, crowned him with flowers, and at length ventured to mount on his back. The disguised god immediately made off with his burden, plunged into the sea, and swam with Europa to the island of Crete, landing not far from Gortyna. Here he resumed his own form, and beneath a plane-tree soothed and caressed the trembling maiden. The offspring of their union were Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon.

<head orig="Eurōpa">Europa</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐρώπη</foreign>). One of the three main divisions of the ancient world. With the northern parts of it the ancients were very slightly acquainted — viz., what are now Prussia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Russia. They applied to this quarter the general name of Scandinavia, and thought it consisted of a number of islands. From the Portuguese Cape to the Ural Mountains, the length of modern Europe may be reckoned at about 3300 miles, and from Cape Nord to Cape Matapan, about 2350.</p>
 <p>The etymologies given for the name Europa are numerous: (1) from the maiden <ref type="cross" target="crosseuropa">Europa</ref> (q.v.);</p>
 <p>(2) from Eurus, the southeast wind;</p>
 <p>(3) from <foreign lang="greek">εὐρύς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὤψ</foreign>, applied to the continent as distinguished from the islands, and hence=“Broad Land,” an explanation favoured by Hermann; and</p>
 <p>(4) from the Semitic <hi rend="italic">erebh</hi>, “darkness,” i. e. “the land of the setting sun,” or “land of the West.”</p>
 <p>As regards the progress of geographical discovery, it may be remarked that the earliest notices of Europe are in the writings of the Greeks, who inhabited the southeastern corner of the continent. From this country the geographical knowledge of Europe extended by degrees to the west and north. Homer was acquainted with the countries round the Aegean Sea. He had also a fairly accurate general notion respecting those which lie on the south coast of the Black Sea; but what he says about the countries west of Greece, on the shores of the Mediterranean, is a mixture of fable and truth, in which the fabulous part prevails. It would seem that, in his age, these seas were not yet visited by his countrymen, and that he obtained his knowledge from the Phoenicians, who had probably for some time sailed to these regions, but who, according to the common policy of trading nations, spread abroad false accounts of these unknown countries, in order to deter other nations from following their track, and participating in the advantages of this distant commerce. It is probable, also, that the Phoenicians long excluded the Greeks from the navigation of the Mediterranean; for when the latter began to form settlements beyond their native country, they first 
<pb n="642" /><cb />
 occupied the shores of the Aegean, and afterwards those of the Black Sea. As the European shores of this last-mentioned sea were not very well adapted for agriculture, their early settlements were mostly on the Asiatic coasts, and, consequently, little addition was made by these colonies to the geographical knowledge of Europe. But the navigation of the Phoenicians was checked in the middle of the sixth century before Christ, apparently because of their subjugation by the Persians. About this time, also, the Greeks began to form settlements in the southern parts of Italy and on the island of Sicily, and to navigate the Mediterranean Sea to its full extent. Accordingly, we find that in the time of Herodotus (B.C. 450) not only the countries on each side of the Mediterranean, and the northern shores of the Black Sea, were known to the Greeks, but that, following the track of the Phoenicians, they ventured to pass the Pillars of Hercules, and to sail as far as the Cassiterides, or Tin Islands, by which name the Scilly Isles and a part of Cornwall must be understood. It is even reported that some of their navigators sailed through the English Channel and entered the North Sea, and perhaps even the Baltic. (See Antichan, <title>Les Grands Voyages de Découvertes des Anciens</title> [Paris, 1891]). Thus a considerable part of the coasts of Europe was discovered, while the interior remained almost unknown. When the Romans began their conquests, this deficiency was partly supplied. The conquest of Italy was followed by that of Spain and the southern parts of Gaul, and, not long afterwards, Sicily, Greece, and Macedonia were added. Caesar conquered Gaul and the countries west of the Rhine, together with the districts lying between the different arms by which that river enters the sea. His two expeditions into Britain made known also, in some measure, the nature of that island and the character of its inhabitants. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbritannia">Britannia</ref>.) Thus, in the course of little more than two hundred years, the interior of all those countries was explored, the shores of which had been previously known. In the meantime, nothing was added to the knowledge of the coasts, the Greeks having lost their spirit of discovery by sea, and the Romans not being inclined to naval enterprise. After the establishment of imperial power at Rome, the conquests of the Romans went on at a much slower rate, and the boundaries of the Empire soon became stationary. This circumstance must be attributed chiefly to the nature of the countries which were contiguous to those boundaries. The regions north of the Danube are mostly plains, and at that time were inhabited only by wandering tribes, who could not be subjected to a regular government. Such, at least, are the countries extending between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea, and therefore the conquest of Dacia by Trajan was of short continuance and speedily abandoned. The countries between the Alps and the Danube were soon added to the Empire; but as the nations who inhabited the tracts north of that river had not given up a nomadic life, they were enabled to elude the Roman yoke. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgermania">Germania</ref>.) The most important addition to the Empire and to geographical knowledge was the conquest of Britain during the first century after Christ, to which, in the following century, the south of Scotland was added. Nothing seems to have been gained afterwards. The geography of Ptolemy contains a <cb /> considerable number of names of nations, places, and rivers in those countries which were not subjected to the Romans. Probably they were obtained from natives and from Roman traders who had ventured to penetrate beyond the boundaries of the Empire. But these brief notices are very vague, and in most cases it is very difficult to determine what places and persons are indicated. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgeographia">Geographia</ref>.

Her disconsolate husband determined to descend to the lower world, to endeavour to procure her restoration to life. Pluto and Persephoné listened to his prayer; and Eurydicé was allowed to return, on the express condition that Orpheus should not look back upon her till they had arrived in the regions of day.

 <p>(3) A daughter of Antipater, and the wife of Ptolemy I. of Egypt, by whom she had several children. After the death of Alexander the Great she proceeded to Alexandria for the purpose of rejoining her husband, and brought with her Berenicé, her niece, who proved the source of all her misfortunes; for Berenicé inspired Ptolemy with so strong a passion that he took her as his second wife, and allowed himself to be controlled by her influence ( <title>Pyrr.</title> 4). Eurydicé and her children retired to the court of Seleucus, king of Syria. One of her daughters subsequently married Agathocles, son of Lysimachus; and another, Demetrius Poliorcetes. Ptolemy Ceraunus, the eldest of her sons, seized upon the kingdom of Macedonia. Eurydicé followed him to that country, and contributed to conciliate the minds of the Macedonians towards him, through the respect which they entertained for the memory of her father Antipater. Ptolemy Ceraunus having been slain, B.C. 280, in a battle against the Gauls, Macedonia was delivered up to the ravages of these barbarians, and Eurydicé fled for protection to the city of Cassandrea. In order to attach the inhabitants more strongly to her interests, she gave them their freedom; and they, through gratitude, established a festival called after her, Eurydicea. The rest of her history is not known.</p>
 <p>(4) A daughter of Amyntas and Cynané. Her previous name was Adea, afterwards changed to Eurydicé.

Having been forsaken, at length, by her own troops, <cb /> she fell into the hands of Olympias, together with her husband. Both were put to death by that queen (Justin, xiv. 5).

It was not known which of the two was born first; the mother, who wished to see both her sons raised on the throne, refused to declare it; and they were both appointed kings of Sparta by order of the oracle of Delphi, B.C. 1102. After the death of the two brothers, the Lacedaemonians, who knew not to what family the right of seniority and succession belonged, permitted two kings to sit on the throne, one of each family. The descendants of Eurysthenes were called Eurysthenidae, and those of Procles, Proclidae. It was inconsistent with the laws of Sparta for two kings of the same family to ascend the throne together, yet that law was sometimes violated by oppression and tyranny. Eurysthenes had a son called Agis , who succeeded him. His descendants were called Agidae. There sat on the throne of Sparta thirty-one kings of the family of Eurysthenes, and only twenty-four of the Proclidae.

<div2 id="crosseusebius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Eusebius">Eusebius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐσέβιος</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pamphĭli</hi>. One of the most distinguished of the earlier Christian writers, the friend of Constantine, born in Palestine, probably at Caesarea, about A.D. 264. He pursued his studies at Antioch, and is believed to have received holy orders from Agapius, bishop of Caesarea. After having been ordained presbyter, he set up a school in his native city, and formed an intimate acquaintance with Pamphilus, bishop of Caesarea, who suffered martyrdom under Galerius, A.D. 309, and in memory of whose friendship he added to his name the term <title>Pamphili</title>—i. e. (the friend) of Pamphilus. After the martyrdom of his friend he removed to Tyre, and thence to Egypt, where he himself was imprisoned. On his return from Egypt, he succeeded Agapius in the see of Caesarea, A.D. 315. In common with many other bishops of Palestine, he at first espoused the cause of Arius; but at the Council of Nice, in 325, where the emperor Constantine assigned to Eusebius the office of opening the session of the assembly, the opinions of the heresiarch were condemned. He <cb /> is said, however, to have raised some objections to the words “consubstantial with the Father,” as applied to the Son in the Nicene creed. His intimacy with his namesake Eusebius , bishop of Nicomedia, who openly espoused the cause of Arius, led him also to favour the same, and to use his influence with the emperor for the purpose of reinstating Arius in the Church, in defiance of the opposition of Athanasius. The party to which he attached himself were called Eusebians, from their leader Eusebius of Nicomedia, and they seem to have acted in a great degree through hostility towards Athanasius and his supporters, as they did not, as yet, openly advocate the objectionable tenets of Arius, who had himself apparently submitted to the decrees of the Council of Nice. Eusebius was deputed by the Council of Tyre to defend before Constantine the judgment which it had passed against Athanasius. The part which he took in this controversy caused him to be stigmatized as an Arian, though it appears that he fully admitted the divinity of Christ. He was, however, unwilling to believe him <foreign lang="greek">συναΐδιος</foreign> or “co-eternal” with the Father. He was much in favour with Constantine, with whom he maintained a correspondence. He died soon after his imperial patron, in 339 or 340.</p>
 <p> Eusebius was one of the most learned men of his time. He had read all sorts of Greek authors, whether philosophers, historians, or divines, of Egypt, Phoenicia, Asia, Europe, and Africa. All his studies were directed towards the religion which he professed, and if he cultivated chronology, it was with the view of establishing on a solid basis the confidence to which the historical books of the Old Testament present a claim. He exhibited the fruits of his researches in a Chronicle, or Universal History (<foreign lang="greek">Παντοδαπὴ Ἱστορία</foreign>), divided into two books. In the first of these, to which he gave the name of “Chronography” (<foreign lang="greek">Χρονογραφία</foreign>), he relates the origin and the history of all nations and empires, from the creation of the world down to A.D. 325. In this first portion of the work, Eusebius introduced extracts from various historical writers whose productions are now lost, such as Alexander Polyhistor, Berosus, Amydenus, Manetho, etc. The second part, entitled “Chronical Canon” (<foreign lang="greek">Χρονικὸς Κανών</foreign>), consisted of synchronistic tables, giving, by periods of ten years each, the names of sovereigns, and the principal events which had taken place, from the call of Abraham (B.C. 2017). In compiling this part of his labours Eusebius availed himself of the Chronography of Sextus Iulius Africanus, which he inserted almost entire in his Canon, completing it by the aid of Manetho, Iosephus, and other historians. This he continued also to his own times. We possess a Latin translation of this chronicle, made by St. Jerome; it is not, however, a simple version, since this father continued the dates down to the year 378, and made several changes also in the first part of the work. The Greek text itself is lost; and though Georgius Syncellus has inserted many fragments of it in his Chronicle, and Eusebius himself has done the same in his <title>Praeparatio Evangelica</title>, the remembrance of this original text was so far lost, that doubts began to be entertained whether that of the first book had ever existed, some critics being persuaded that Eusebius had written no other chronological work besides his <title>Canon.</title> Joseph Scaliger, however, undertook to 
<pb n="645" /><cb />
 reconstruct the first book of the work, by uniting all the fragments scattered throughout the writings of the various authors to whom allusion has been made. The whole subject has at length been cleared up in later times, and all uncertainty on this point has been put completely to rest since 1792, when an Armenian of Constantinople, named Georgius Iohannis, discovered an Armenian translation of the entire work. The first book of the Chronicle of Eusebius , with which we are made acquainted through the medium of this translation, is preceded by a preface, in which the author gives an account of the plan and difficulty of his undertaking. It is divided into forty-eight chapters, of which the first twenty-two embrace the chronology of the Chaldaeans, Assyrians, Medes, Lydians, Persians, Hebrews, and Egyptians, comprehending under the latter head the dynasty of the Ptolemies. The remaining chapters, from the twenty-third to the forty-eighth, are devoted to the chronology of the Greeks and Romans, down to the time of Iulius Caesar.</p>
 <p> Eusebius was also the author of an Ecclesiastical History (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐκκλησιαστικὴ Ἱστορία</foreign>), in ten books, from the origin of Christianity down to A.D. 324, a year which immediately preceded the triumph of the Catholic church over Arianism. This history was translated into Latin by Rufinus, a priest of Aquilea, in the fourth century, who made, however, retrenchments as well as additions, and added a supplement in two books, which extends to the death of Theodosius the Great.</p>
 <p>The other works of Eusebius which have relation to the department of ecclesiastical history are the following: (1) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῶν ἐν Παλαιστίνῃ Μαρτυρησάντων</foreign>, “Of those who suffered martyrdom in Palestine.” The period referred to is the persecution of Dioclesian and Maximin, from 303 to 309.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Λόγος Τριακονταετηρικός</foreign>, “Thirty-year Discourse,” i. e. an eloge on Constantine, pronounced in the thirtieth year of his reign, A.D. 335.</p>
 <p>(3) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τοῦ κατὰ Θεὸν Βίου τοῦ Μακαρίου Κωνσταντίνου τοῦ Βασιλέως</foreign>. A life of Constantine, in four books.</p>
 <p>(4) <foreign lang="greek">Τῶν Ἀρχαίων Μαρτύρων Συναγωγή</foreign>, “A Collection of Ancient Martyrs.” This work is lost, but many fragments have been preserved by the legendary writers of subsequent ages.</p>
 <p>(5) A life of Pamphilus, of which there remains a solitary fragment.</p>
 <p>(6) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῶν κατὰ Διαφόρους Καιροὺς ἐν Διαφόροις Πόλεσιν Ἀθλησάντων Ἁγίων Μαρτύρων</foreign>, “Of the holy martyrs that have contended for the faith at various times and in various places.” Another work of Eusebius forms the principal one of his theological writings. This is his</p>
 <p>(7) <foreign lang="greek">Εὐαγγελικῆς Ἀποδείξεως Προπαρασκευή</foreign>, or <title>Praeparatio Evangelica.</title> This work, though its subject is one entirely sacred in its nature, yet contains a great number of valuable notices respecting the mythology of the pagan nations, and the philosophy of the Greeks in particular. We find in it, also, numerous passages taken from more than four hundred profane writers, and in this list are many whose productions are now lost. The <title>Praeparatio Evangelica</title> is addressed to Theodotus, bishop of Laodicea, and is divided into fifteen books. To prepare his readers for a demonstration of evangelical truths by reasons purely philosophical, and, by collecting together a mass of citations drawn from profane authors, to show how far superior Christianity is to all the systems of the pagan world—such is the object of Eusebius in the work under consideration. In the first six books <cb /> he proves the futility of the heathen doctrines; the nine following ones develop the motives which have induced the followers of Christianity to prefer to them the Jewish system of theology as contained in the Old Testament. One must not omit another work of Eusebius , entitled</p>
 <p>(8) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῶν Τοπικῶν Ὀνομάτων ἐν τῇ Θείᾳ Γραφῇ</foreign>, “Of the places mentioned in the sacred writings.” It was in two books. The second book, which treats of Palestine, has alone reached us; we have it in Greek, and also in a Latin version by St. Jerome. Still another work of Eusebius ,</p>

 <p> (1) A Latin historian of the fourth century. He bore arms under Julian in his expedition against the Parthians, as he himself informs us (x. 16), and is thought to have risen to senatorial rank. Suidas makes him of Italian origin, while some modern writers, on the other hand, advance the hypothesis that he was a native of Gaul, and was perhaps identical with the Eutropius to whom some of the letters of Symmachus are addressed. The manuscripts give him the title of Vir Cl., which may stand for either Vir Clarissimus or Vir Consularis, but which in either sense indicates an advancement to some of the highest offices in the State. He wrote several works, of which the only one remaining is an abridgment of Roman history (<title>Breviarium ab Urbe Condita</title>), in ten books. It is a brief and dry outline, without either elegance or ornament, yet containing certain facts which are nowhere else mentioned. The work commences with the foundation of the city, and is carried on to the death of Jovian, A.D. 364. At the close of this work Eutropius announces his intention of continuing the narrative in a more elevated style, inasmuch as he will have to treat of great personages still living. It does not appear that he ever carried this plan into execution. The best editions are those of Grosse <bibl default="NO">(Halle, 1813)</bibl>, Hartel <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1872)</bibl>, and of Droysen <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1878)</bibl>.

 <p>(2) A eunuch and minister of the emperor Arcadius, who rose by infamous practices from the lowest condition to the highest pitch of opulence and power. He was probably a native of Asia, was made chamberlain to the emperor in the year A.D. 395, and, after the fall of Rufinus, succeeded that minister in the confidence of his master, and rose to unlimited authority. He was even created consul, a disgrace to Rome never before equalled. An insult offered to the empress was the cause of his overthrow; and he was sent into perpetual exile at Cyprus. He was soon afterwards, however, brought back on another charge; and after being condemned, was beheaded in 399 (Zosim. v. 10, 18, etc.).

Rom.</title> 53). Sixty years before the Trojan War he led a Pelasgian colony to Latium from Pallantium in Arcadia, and founded a city, Pallantium, near the Tiber, on the hill which was afterwards named after it the Palatine. Further it was said that he taught the rude inhabitants of the country writing, music, and other arts; and introduced from Arcadia the worship of certain gods, in particular of Pan, whom the Italians called Faunus, with the festival of the <ref type="cross" target="crosslupercalia">Lupercalia</ref> (q.v.), which was held in his honour. Evander was worshipped at Rome among the heroes of the country (see <ref type="cross" target="crossindigetes">Indigetes</ref>), and had an altar on the Aventine Hill. But the whole story is evidently an invention of Greek scholars, who derived the Lupercalia from the Arcadian Lycaea. The name <foreign lang="greek">Εὔανδρος</foreign> is perhaps a translation of the Italian Faunus, while Carmenta, his mother, is an ancient Italian goddess; but on this, see Nettleship, <title>Lectures and Essays</title>, pp. 50 foll.</p>

 <p> In Roman law <seg lang="la">evincere</seg> means generally to deprive a person of a thing or right, of which he is in the <cb /> enjoyment, by legal process; but the commonest case of <seg lang="la">evictio</seg> is that of the contract of sale. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossemptio-et-venditio">Emptio et Venditio</ref>.) The vendor not being bound to make the purchaser owner of the thing sold (<title>Dig.</title> xix. 1. 11. 2), things were often bought and sold which did not belong to the vendor; and as the latter could give no better title than he had himself, the purchaser was liable to be deprived of the <seg lang="la">res vendita</seg> (i. e. “evicted”) by the lawful owner. Originally there seems to have been no obligation on the vendor to compensate on such eviction, except in sales by mancipation, when the vendor was bound to return double the price to the purchaser, in such an event ( Paul. <title>Sent.</title>rec. 2. 17. 3); but in ordinary sales it seems to have become usual for the purchaser to stipulate from the vendor for a penal sum of twice the amount of the purchase-money (<seg lang="la">stipulatio duplae</seg>), if deprived of the property by any one with a better title. Eventually it became a general rule of law that if the purchaser was “evicted” by legal process, the vendor must indemnify him (<title>Dig.</title> xxi. 2. 1).

The archaeological and historical interest of this building lies in the fact that the policemen, when off duty, had amused themselves by writing on the walls, thus leaving us a very vivid picture of the daily routine of an ancient policeman's life, and also of his sentiments, expressed in language that is always direct and plain, and frequently profane.

Leg.</title> 40). More usually, however, the word was applied to any interpreter of laws, whether sacred or secular, but especially the former (<title>Etym. Mag.</title> s. v.), as the <ref type="cross" target="crosseupatridae">Eupatridae</ref> (q.v.). Among the Eupatrids, again, the <ref type="cross" target="crosseumolpidae">Eumolpidae</ref> (q.v.) were <foreign lang="greek">ἐξηγηταί</foreign> of a special class of sacred laws, those, namely, relating to the Eleusinian mysteries; these laws were unwritten, and of immemorial antiquity ([Lys. ] <title>c. Andoc.</title> 10). But with regard to the written and civil laws of Athens in democratic times, the notion of several grammarians that there was a class of <foreign lang="greek">ἐξηγηταί</foreign> or expounders of them, answering to the Roman jurisconsults, is untenable, and indeed no longer held; the silence of the orators is sufficient proof that no such persons existed (Ruhnken on Timaeus, <title>Lex. Plat.</title> s. v.). In Athenian courts, both the dicasts and the presiding judges acted without the guidance of trained lawyers, and required the laws which they administered to be intelligible to plain men. At the same time, the conservatism of ancient religion involved a frequent appeal to experts in purely ceremonial matters. Thus, the guilt of a homicide and the punishment of it were to be determined by the law-courts; but if the homicide were proved accidental or justifiable, the ceremonial expiation, the reconciliation with the relatives of the deceased, and the disposal of the corpse remained as the province of <foreign lang="greek">ἐξηγηταί</foreign>.</p>
 <p>In an official sense, the exegetae were a board of three persons, to whom application might be made in matters relating to sacred law; they were all to be Eupatrids, and one of them necessarily a member of the family of the Eumolpidae. The mode of their appointment is not known; and the question whether they took cognizance of all appeals from private persons like those mentioned above, or only of public matters, is open to some doubt. They attended in the assembly of the people, and interpreted the <foreign lang="greek">διοσημίαι</foreign>, or signs from heaven; they had thus the power of stopping the business in hand, corresponding to the <seg lang="la">obnuntiatio</seg> of the Roman augurs. But we may be sure that the democratic Athenians would not allow an absolute or irresponsible veto to these or any other officials; their action, like that of an Epistates who refused to put the question to the vote, was no doubt liable to impeachment; in practice it is probable that only a shower or other unmistakable phenomenon was allowed to break up the meeting, so that their duty would be purely a

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">στρατός, στράτευμα</foreign>). A body of men organized and armed for the defence of the State; an army.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. The most military people among the Greeks were the Spartans, whose whole life was spent in the practice of martial exercises, so that even the meals shared in common by all free Spartan citizens (<foreign lang="greek">συσσιτία</foreign>) were arranged with reference to military service. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssyssitia">Syssitia</ref>.) With them the duty of actual service began with the twentieth year, and did not end until their capacity for that service ceased to exist. After their sixtieth year, however, all Spartan soldiers were exempt from foreign duty. In the Lacedaemonian army, the heavy-armed troops (<foreign lang="greek">ὁπλῖται</foreign>) were originally all citizens, but as early as the Persian Wars, the perioechi served side by side with the native Spartans, though in separate divisions (<foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign>). The Helots who accompanied the troops served as attendants (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπασπισταί</foreign>) to the hoplites, and as light-armed troops in battle. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshelotae">Helotae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshypaspistae">Hypaspistae</ref>.) A picked body of men (<foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign>) was formed from among the hoplites, and served as a special body-guard to the kings. They were 300 in number, and were all active, powerful young men under thirty years of age, selected and commanded by three officers, known as <foreign lang="greek">ἱππαγρέται</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign>, as the name implies, must have been originally horsemen, but were no longer so in the time of the Persian Wars ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 124" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 124</bibl>). A corps of light infantry was formed in the district of Sciritis, and was hence called Sciritae, the especial duty assigned to them being the outpost service of the camp, reconnoitring on the march, and in battle the support of the left wing. From the end of the fifth century B.C., the Spartan army was divided into six <seg lang="la">morae</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">μόραι</foreign>), each commanded by a <foreign lang="greek">πολέμαρχος</foreign> ( <bibl n="Xen. Const. Lac. 11. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Lac.</title>11. 4</bibl>). As the number of Spartan citizens decreased, these ultimately composed merely the <hi rend="italic">cadre</hi> of the <seg lang="la">mora</seg>, which were brought up to their full complement by the addition of perioechi; though the officers were always Spartans, as were the members of the royal staff. Each <seg lang="la">mora</seg> was divided into four (or five) companies (<foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign>). The cavalry played only an unimportant part in the Spartan army. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshippeis">Hippeis</ref>.) In time of war the ephors (see <ref type="cross" target="crossephori">Ephori</ref>) commanded the veteran troops. In early times the kings divided the supreme command between them, but after B.C. 512, only one commanded, unless more than one general was needed from the circumstances of the case. The Spartans maintained a fleet in which Helots served as marines and oarsmen. In cases of great necessity these were sometimes transferred to the army to serve as hoplites, in which case they received their freedom, and were then known as <foreign lang="greek">νεοδαμώδεις</foreign>. The fleet was commanded by <foreign lang="greek">ναύαρχοι</foreign>, or admirals.</p>
 <p>At Athens every freeborn man was liable to military service, the only exceptions being the holders of public offices, and, in early times, the very lowest class of citizens. Every youth on reaching his eighteenth year (<foreign lang="greek">ἔφηβος</foreign>) served for ten years, most frequently on the frontier, during which time his military education was completed, though he was then liable to serve at any time up to his sixtieth year. In time of war the Assembly <cb /> fixed the number of men required for duty: in extreme cases a <seg lang="la">levée en masse</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πανστρατιά</foreign>) was resorted to. Ten generals (<foreign lang="greek">στρατηγοί</foreign>) were elected by the people annually, and it was their duty to levy the troops and organize them in such a way that the men of each tribe (<foreign lang="greek">φυλή</foreign>) were commanded by the same officer (<foreign lang="greek">φύλαρχοι</foreign>). These phylarchs, as well as the taxiarchs (<foreign lang="greek">ταξίαρχοι</foreign>), or captains of companies, were elected by the people. This levy served as hoplites, while the men of the lowest <figure id="fig.00649">
<head orig="Early Greek Soldier. (Stelé of Aristion.)">Early Greek Soldier. (Stele of Aristion.)</head>
</figure> class (<foreign lang="greek">θῆτες</foreign>) were sometimes used as light-armed troops (<foreign lang="greek">πελτάσται</foreign>), and sometimes with the fleet. As the age of military service extended from the eighteenth to the sixtieth year, there were thus forty-two classes of age, and every man was mustered in a list (<foreign lang="greek">κατάλογος</foreign>) under the name of the Archon Eponymus under whom he first reached the military age (Schömann, <title>Antiq. Greece</title>, Eng. trans. p. 423; but cf. Aristotle, <title>Polit. Ath.</title> 53, with Kenyon's note). The men of the first two classes who served on the frontier were called <foreign lang="greek">περίπολοι</foreign>. After the twentieth year they could be sent on foreign service. The army contained ten battalions (<foreign lang="greek">τάξεις</foreign>), sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">φυλαί</foreign>, of which the subdivisions were called <foreign lang="greek">λόχοι</foreign>. The troops were sometimes equipped with the aid of the resident aliens (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοιχοι</foreign>) of Attica, and in earlier times by the contingents contributed by the allies. From the time of Pericles on, the cavalry received pay amounting to some four obols, or about $0.12 a day, with an allowance for the horseman's attendant. On the cavalry, see <ref type="cross" target="crosshippeis">Hippeis</ref>.</p>
 <p>In most of the other Greek States the hoplites, consisting of wealthy citizens, formed the main strength of the army, and generally helped to turn the scale in engagements in which the light-armed troops and the cavalry played a subordinate part. They fought in the <foreign lang="greek">φάλαγξ</foreign> (q. v.), in closely serried lines eight deep. The flower of the troops were stationed on the right wing as the post of honour, to advance to meet the foe amid the singing of the paean. When at a distance of about 200 yards, at the signal of a trumpet, they raised the battle-cry (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλαλά</foreign>) and charged either at a run or at quick step. It was only the Spartans who slowly advanced at an even pace and to the sound of flutes. A request for permission to bury the dead was the formal admission of defeat. The enduring token of victory was a trophy composed of the armour captured from the defeated side. It was usual to join battle on ground which was suitable for the phalanx. The Peloponnesian War was the means of introducing many innovations, including the 
<pb n="650" /><cb />
 formation of a regular force of light infantry, called <foreign lang="greek">πελτασταί</foreign> (q. v.). Still more decisive in the transformation of the general system of Greek warfare was the famous retreat of the Ten Thousand, the first important mercenary army among the Greeks which tried to make the phalanx of hoplites suit the ground better, and to utilize at the same time the light infantry, or peltasts, and the <foreign lang="greek">γυμνῆτες</foreign> (spearmen, bowmen, and slingers). Iphicrates, the first distinguished general of mercenary troops, introduced a lighter equipment by substituting a small <foreign lang="greek">πέλτη</foreign> for the heavy shield, adopting a longer sword and spear, lighter shoes, and a linen corslet.</p>
 <p>In the course of the fourth century B.C. the army composed of civilians gave way more and more to the mercenary army, which, by its intimate knowledge of the use of its weapons, gained an immense advantage in actual war. An important novelty was the oblique battle-order, the discovery of <ref type="cross" target="crossepaminondas">Epaminondas</ref> (q.v.). In this the great mass and strength of the hoplites was drawn up in considerable depth on one of the two wings, without any expansion of the front. The hoplites could thus make a vigorous attack on the centre of the enemy's wing, while the true centre and the other wing of the assailants were held in reserve, with a view to advancing later to crush the enemy.</p>
 <p>The Macedonian method of warfare, invented by King Philip II. and his son Alexander the Great, was based upon the Greek military organization adapted to Macedonian requirements. For this purpose, that organization was duly developed, and the different parts of the army, the infantry and cavalry, light and heavy-armed troops, military levies, allies and mercenary troops, were blended together into a far freer and more effective system than the Greeks ever attained in their art of war. In point of numbers the strongest component part of the Macedonian army, as elsewhere, was the heavy and light infantry. The former consisted of the <foreign lang="greek">πεζέταιροι</foreign>, a body of Macedonians of free but not noble origin, corresponding to the Greek hoplites, though not so heavily armed. Like the hoplites, they fought in a phalanx, but this was generally deeper than theirs, being eight and afterwards sixteen men deep. They formed six <foreign lang="greek">τάξεις</foreign>, corresponding to the number of the districts of Macedonia, each of which was represented by one <foreign lang="greek">τάξις</foreign>. (See further under <ref type="cross" target="crossphalanx">Phalanx</ref>.) The <foreign lang="greek">ὑπασπισταί</foreign> were the equivalent of the Hellenic peltasts, and were a standing corps of 3000 men. Besides these there were strong contingents of other kinds of light infantry, especially spearmen and archers. While in the Greek armies the number of the cavalry had always been small, they formed nearly one-sixth of the whole army which Alexander took with him on his Asiatic expedition, and consisted of an equal number of light and heavy cavalry. (See further under <ref type="cross" target="crosshippeis">Hippeis</ref>.) The central point in the great battles of Alexander was the phalanx; on the right of this were placed the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπασπισταί</foreign>, the heavy and light Macedonian cavalry, the spearmen, and archers; on the left, the Thracian peltasts, the Hellenic contingent of cavalry, with the Thessalian cavalry, and light troops, horsemen, and archers. The two wings were reckoned from the centre of the phalanx, the right being usually reserved for the attack, and led by the king. The light troops began the attack, which was supported by the heavy Macedonian cavalry, followed by the <foreign lang="greek">ὑπασπισταί</foreign>. <cb /> The heavy infantry came up in detachments to keep the line unbroken, and formed an oblique battle-array. Thus the main attack was made by the heavy cavalry, and no longer, as with the other Greeks, by the phalanx. On the contrary, the phalanx formed the solid centre of the whole army —a centre which it was impossible for the enemy to break, and which was itself irresistible in attack. Under the successors of Alexander, the phalanx was, however, regarded as strengthening the whole army and lengthening the formation, rather than as a factor of offensive operations. The battle was decided by the wings, which were composed of cavalry—one wing being destined for the attack while the other remained on the defensive. The light infantry and the elephants which were now brought into use were brought to bear as occasion demanded, but were chiefly used in masking the preparatory movements of the attacking wing, very much, in fact, as cavalry is used in the modern German tactics.</p>
 <p>During the third century B.C., the cavalry declined in importance and hence in numbers, while the heavy-armed infantry, with the formidable <foreign lang="greek">σάρισσα</foreign>, twenty-four feet long, became more and more effective. The phalanx was now used in attacking, and its onset usually decided the battle. In that century, mercenary armies became very common, and at last Greek military science yielded to that of the Romans mainly because the tactics of the phalanx were ill-suited to a hand-to-hand engagement. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslochus">Lochus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmora">Mora</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphalanx">Phalanx</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—Down to the year B.C. 104, when the people, alarmed by the advance of the formidable Cimbri, kept C. Marius in the consulate for five years in disregard of the Constitution, the Roman army had been nothing more than a militia of citizens, the body of the free burgesses in arms, as established by Servius Tullius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia Centuriata</ref>.) The whole population was divided into five classes. The first class was divided between cavalry (<seg lang="la">equites</seg>) and infantry (<seg lang="la">pedites</seg>), and all five classes into <hi rend="italic">iuniores</hi> and <seg lang="la">seniores</seg>, the former being employed for active service in the field, and the latter for the defence of the city. Every citizen from his seventeenth to his forty-fifth or fiftieth year was liable to service unless he belonged to the lowest class (<seg lang="la">proletarii</seg>), or had already served in twenty campaigns on foot or in ten campaigns as a cavalryman. The military levy was by tribes, and was made in a general assembly of citizens at the Capitol or on the Campus Martius, an equal number of men being taken from each tribe. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdilectus">Dilectus</ref>.) The regular levy was 8500 <seg lang="la">seniores</seg> and 17,000 <hi rend="italic">iuniores</hi>, a total of 25,500 men. These were formed into four legions of 4250 or 4500 men each, and a body of 1800 cavalry. The rest of the recruits formed a reserve to supply the losses sustained by the legions. There were generally two consular armies, each of two legions, besides contingents of the allies of equal infantry and double cavalry strength, as the native Roman cavalry was inferior, and preferred always to fight dismounted. A legion was made up as follows: 1200 <seg lang="la">velites</seg> (light-armed skirmishers, also called <seg lang="la">accensi, rorarii</seg>, and <seg lang="la">ferentarii</seg>), 1200 <seg lang="la">hastati</seg>, 1200 <seg lang="la">principes</seg>, 600 <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, and 300 <seg lang="la">equites.</seg> The <seg lang="la">hastati, principes</seg>, and <seg lang="la">triarii</seg> were each divided into ten <seg lang="la">manipuli</seg>, or companies, and an equal number of <seg lang="la">velites</seg> were attached to each. The <seg lang="la">hastati</seg> and <seg lang="la">principes</seg> formed respectively the first and second 
<pb n="651" /><cb />
 line, and were armed with spears (<seg lang="la">hastae</seg>); the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg> were the reserve, and carried the <seg lang="la">pilum</seg>, a short and very heavy spear, which they hurled into the ranks of the enemy immediately before closing with them in a hand-to-hand struggle with the sword (<seg lang="la">gladius</seg>). <figure id="fig.00651">
<head orig="Roman Soldiers. (Column of Trajan.)">Roman Soldiers. (Column of Trajan.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Each <seg lang="la">manipulus</seg> was commanded by a centurion (<seg lang="la">centurio</seg>), having a second centurion for his lieutenant. The first centurion of the first <seg lang="la">manipulus</seg> of the <seg lang="la">triarii</seg>, who was known as <seg lang="la">primus pilus</seg>, in the absence of a superior officer, took command of the whole legion. The chief command of the legion was held in turn by the six military tribunes (<seg lang="la">tribuni militum</seg>), each of whom commanded for two months at a time; but after the first civil wars, a single officer (<seg lang="la">legatus</seg>) permanently directed each legion, having the military tribunes as his staff.</p>
 <p>The protracted wars with Pyrrhus and Carthage led to the first important change in the constitution of the army. From this time, the practice of giving the soldiers regular pay was established, and paved the way for the establishment of a regular army, which took place, as noted above, in the consulship of Marius, from which time the enlisted man was a professional soldier, serving continuously in the army for twenty years. The legion now consisted of 6000 troops, divided into ten cohorts of 600 men each, uniformly armed with the <seg lang="la">pilum.</seg> The place of the <seg lang="la">velites</seg> was supplied by foreign mercenaries, bowmen (<seg lang="la">sagittarii</seg>) from Crete, javelin-men (<seg lang="la">iaculatores</seg>) from Mauretania, and slingers (<seg lang="la">funditores</seg>) from the Baleares. The cavalry was also chiefly foreign, with a few Roman <seg lang="la">equites</seg> in special posts of honour. The general had a body-guard (<seg lang="la">praetoriani</seg>) of some 5000 men, with high pay and special privileges. At this time the silver eagle was adopted as the standard (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssignum">Signum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvexillum">Vexillum</ref>), and was carried by the first century of the first cohort. There were also auxiliary <cb /> troops of varying number divided into <seg lang="la">cohortes</seg>, and consisting of both infantry and cavalry.</p>
 <p>Under Caesar the legion consisted nominally of about 5000 men, though actually of less. According to Rüstow it was divided into ten cohorts of 300 or 360 men each; each cohort into three maniples of 100 to 120 men each; and each maniple into two centuries of 50 to 60 men each. In battle the ten cohorts were regularly drawn up as in the following figure, which represents the <seg lang="la">acies triplex</seg> of Caesar: <figure /></p>
 <p>The cavalry, divided into <seg lang="la">turmae</seg>, or squadrons, and commanded by a <seg lang="la">decurio</seg>, was usually stationed on both wings; but at Pharsalus on only one; while at Bibracté it was held in the rear. The defensive order of battle was the hollow square (<seg lang="la">orbis</seg>), which corresponds with the formation on the march called <seg lang="la">agmen quadratum.</seg> The general term for the army on the march is <seg lang="la">agmen;</seg> in battle order, <seg lang="la">acies.</seg> When the signal for the march was given, the <seg lang="la">extraordinarii</seg> (q. v.) with the allies of the right wing moved first, then the legions, and last the allies of the left wing with part of the cavalry who were said <seg lang="la">elaudere agmen</seg> or <seg lang="la">cogere agmen.</seg> An army marching in close order was called <seg lang="la">agmen iustum</seg> or <seg lang="la">agmen pilatum.</seg> The van is <seg lang="la">primum agmen;</seg> the centre, <seg lang="la">medium agmen;</seg> the rear, <seg lang="la">extremum</seg> or <seg lang="la">novissimum agmen.</seg> The formation called <seg lang="la">agmen quadratum</seg>, shown below, was adopted when a sudden attack was expected. The baggage was then placed within the lines.</p>
 <p>The commander-in-chief was called <seg lang="la">dux</seg> or <seg lang="la">imperator;</seg> the commanders of the legions, <seg lang="la">legati;</seg> the staff of the legions were the <seg lang="la">tribuni militum;</seg> the orderlies and aides, <seg lang="la">contubernales</seg> or <seg lang="la">comites praetori;</seg> the paymaster and quartermaster-general, <seg lang="la">quaestor.</seg> In case there were not sufficient legates, the quaestor also commanded the legion.</p>
 <p>Under Augustus the completion of the Roman standing army was carried out, and twenty-five <figure id="fig.00651.2">
<head orig="Agmen Quadratum. (Antonine Column.)">Agmen Quadratum. (Antonine Column.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="652" /><cb />
 legions were maintained throughout the Empire, besides the Praetorian Guard. Under Trajan there were thirty legions; under Septimius Severus, thirty-three. At this time the name <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> was changed to <seg lang="la">praefectus</seg>, the first cohort was doubled in strength (<seg lang="la">cohors milliaria</seg>), and the minimum strength of the legion was fixed at 6100 infantry and 726 cavalry. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslegio">Legio</ref>.</p>
 <p>Under the Republic and the early Empire, the military drill was very severe, comprising running, jumping, wrestling, swimming (both naked and in full armour), besides drill, the use of intrenching tools, and long marches at the rate of four miles per hour, with a load of from 35 to 60 lbs. This was required not only from recruits but from veterans as well. The equipment of the soldier was very heavy. The wagons transported the general baggage (<seg lang="la">impedimenta</seg>) and the tents; yet each soldier, besides his shield, helmet, breastplate, <seg lang="la">pilum</seg>, and sword, was obliged to carry corn for seventeen days, stakes for the palisade of the camp, and intrenching tools (Veget. i. 19).</p>
 <p>In the time of Polybius the regular pay of a soldier of the legion was about $0.07 per diem (1/3 of a <seg lang="la">denarius</seg>), that of a centurion, $0.14; and that of a cavalryman, $0.20. Caesar fixed the pay of a soldier at 225 <seg lang="la">denarii</seg> (about $45) per annum. Under Domitian it was raised to 300 denarii ($60). Out of this the soldier paid for his clothes and accoutrements ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 17</bibl>). The only superior officer's pay that is known is that of the <seg lang="la">tribunus legionis</seg>, in the third century A.D., when it was 25,000 sesterces ($1000). On the pay and other service conditions of the Praetorian Guard, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspraetoriani">Praetoriani</ref>.</p>
 <p>The regular food of the Roman soldier was wheat made into a kind of porridge (<hi rend="italic">puls</hi>) or bread (<seg lang="la">panis</seg>), and occasionally meat and vegetables (<seg lang="la">legumina</seg>). Vinegar was allowed the soldiers for the drink called <seg lang="la">posca</seg> (q. v.). Provisions were also often gathered by foraging, in which case they naturally depended on the soldier's luck. For the rewards of military service, see the articles <ref type="cross" target="crosscorona">Corona</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossovatio">Ovatio</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstriumphus">Triumphus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Military punishments were of various sorts, comprising (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) whipping (<seg lang="la">castigatio</seg>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) a fine (<seg lang="la">pecuniaria multa</seg>); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) loss of rank (<seg lang="la">militiae mutatio</seg>); (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) drumming out of camp (<seg lang="la">ignominiosa missio;</seg> cf. the pseud. <title>Bell. Afr.</title> 54, 4); (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) the substitution of barley for wheat in their rations; (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) decimation (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdecimatio">Decimatio</ref>); (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) death, which could be inflicted only by the consul under the Republic, and by the emperor or <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> under the Empire.</p>
 <p>On his honourable discharge (<seg lang="la">honesta missio</seg>), the soldier received either land or a present of money, ranging from 3000 denarii ($600) to 5000 denarii ($1000). A discharge for physical disability or sickness was called <seg lang="la">causaria missio.</seg></p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξετασταί</foreign>). Special commissioners sent out by the Athenian people to investigate any matters that might claim attention. Thus we find mention of exetastae being appointed to ascertain whether there were as many mercenaries as the generals reported. It appears to have been no uncommon plan for the commanders, like the French officials of the Second Empire, who received pay for troops, to report a greater number than they possessed, in order to receive the pay themselves; in which case they were said “to draw pay for empty places in the mercenary force” ( <title>c. Ctes.</title> 146). The commissioners, however, who were sent to make inquiries into the matter, often allowed themselves to be bribed ( <title>c. Timarch.</title> 113; <title>De F. L.</title> 177).</p>
 <p>Another kind of exetastae is shown by inscriptions to have existed at Athens for a short time in the early part of the third century B.C. They were auditors of accounts, and are mentioned as checking the expenses of psephismata (i. e. of recording them) and of the erection of statues (<title>C. I. A.</title> i. 297, 298, 300). In this sense of auditors of public accounts the name occurred in some other Greek States.

Amusing interludes in verse, inserted by the Romans in other plays, but chiefly in the Atellanae (<bibl n="Liv.  7. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vii. 2</bibl>). It is difficult to ascertain the real character of the exodia; but from the words of Livy we must infer that, although distinct from the Atellanae, they were closely connected with them, and never 
<pb n="653" /><cb />
 performed alone. Hence Juvenal speaks of the <title>exodium Atellanae </title>( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 6. 71" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>vi. 71</bibl>), and Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 45" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tib.</title>45</bibl>) <title>exodium Atellanicum.</title> They were, like the Atellanae themselves, played by young and well-born Romans, and not by the professional actors. The exodia have generally been considered as short comedies or farces which were performed after the Atellanae—an opinion founded upon the vague and incorrect statement of the Scholiast on Juvenal ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 3. 174" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>iii. 174</bibl>). But the words of Livy , <seg lang="la">exodia conserta fabellis</seg>, seem rather to indicate interludes, which, however, must not be understood as if they had been played between the acts of the Atellanae, which would suggest a false idea of the Atellanae themselves; but as several Atellanae were performed on the same day, it is probable that the exodia were played between them. This supposition is also supported by the etymology of the word itself, which signifies something <foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ὁδοῦ</foreign>, <seg lang="la">extra viam</seg>, or something not belonging to the main subject, and thus is synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεισόδιον</foreign>. The play, as well as its name of exodium, seems to have been introduced among the Romans from Italian Greece; but after its introduction it appears to have become very popular among the Romans, and continued to be played down to a very late period ( <title>Domit.</title> 10).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</foreign>). (1) One of the many machines used in the theatres of the ancients. Its introduction was ascribed to Aeschylus. In order to represent a scene in an interior, a movable chamber corresponding to the size of any of the three doors was devised, which was wheeled out (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign>) or pushed out (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</foreign>) ( <bibl n="Poll.  4. 128" default="NO">Poll.iv. 128</bibl>; Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Acharn.</title> 375). Donaldson thinks the <foreign lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</foreign> was used to exhibit the interior of an upper chamber; this would find support in the late meaning of the word, “balcony.” A special use of both machines was to exhibit to the eyes of the spectators the results or consequences of such acts, as murder or suicide, as could not be permitted to take place in the <seg lang="la">proscenium</seg>, and were therefore described as having occurred behind the <seg lang="la">scena.</seg> See Donaldson, <title>Theatre of the Greeks</title>, ed. 7, p. 238 foll.; C.

<div2 id="crossexoules-dike" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Exoules Diké">Exoules Dike</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξούλης δίκη</foreign>). An action under the Attic law, for ejectment, resorted to by a plaintiff when his title to the property in question was so much better than the defendant's as to be indisputable. Thus a son or other male descendant (also a son adopted during the testator's lifetime) might enter (see <ref type="cross" target="crossembatea">Embateia</ref>), and become possessed of the estate immediately after the owner's death (<bibl n="Isaeus 3.61" default="NO" valid="yes">Isae. <title>Pyrrh.</title>61</bibl>). Such an heir made a formal entry upon the land, and thereby became “seised” or possessed of it; then the adverse claimant came and turned him off (Demosth. <title>c. Leoch.</title> p. 1090. 32). This proceeding took place quietly and in the presence of witnesses (<bibl n="Isaeus 3.22" default="NO" valid="yes">Isae. <title>Pyrrh.</title>22</bibl>); and then the heir might bring against him an action for ejectment.</p>
 <p>These proceedings by entry, ouster, etc., were a relic of ancient times, when, before regular processes were invented, parties adopted a ruder method and took the law into their own hands. There was then an actual ouster, accompanied often with violence and breach of the peace, for which the person in the wrong was not only responsible to the party injured, but was also punishable as a public offender. Afterwards, in the course of civilization, violent remedies became useless and were discontinued; yet the ceremony of ejection was still kept up as a form of law, being deemed by lawyers a necessary foundation of the subsequent legal process. Thus at Rome, in the earlier times, one party used to summon the other by the words <seg lang="la">ex iure te manum consertum voco</seg>, to go with him to the land in dispute, and (in the presence of the praetor and others) turn him out by force. Afterwards this was changed into the symbolical act of breaking a clod of earth upon the land, by which the person who broke intimated that he claimed a right to deal with the land as he pleased.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φυγή</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. Among the Greeks, exile was the legal punishment for homicide (see <ref type="cross" target="crossephetae">Ephetae</ref>), and for sundry other offences, such as wounding with intent to kill, the murder of a non-citizen for impiety (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσέβεια</foreign>); and was often voluntary on the part of those who wished to avoid some other form of punishment. It was also, at times, a political measure, adopted especially in times of civil disturbance, and might carry with it <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign> and loss of property, except in the case of ostracism. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossostracismus">Ostracismus</ref>.)

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. Among the Romans there was, originally, no such thing as a direct expulsion from the city ( <title>Pro Caec.</title> 34); but a man might be cut off from fire and water, the symbol of civic communion, which of course practically forced him to leave the country. This <seg lang="la">interdictio aquae et ignis</seg> was originally inflicted by the Comitia Centuriata, and later by the permanent judicial commissions appointed to try certain serious offences, as, for instance, treason, arson, and 
<pb n="654" /><cb />
 poisoning. In case of the capital charge the accused was always free to anticipate an unfavourable verdict, or the <seg lang="la">interdictio aquae et ignis</seg>, by withdrawing into voluntary exile; for exile was originally conceived not as a punishment, but as a means of escaping punishment ( <title>Pro Dom.</title> 34), and we hear of the <seg lang="la">ius exsulandi</seg> (cf. Schwegler, <title>Römische Geschichte</title>, i. p. 438). Voluntary exile, as being a confession of guilt, was regularly confirmed by a plebiscitum; and when the exile was recalled, the decree was also annulled by legislative act. <title>Interdictio</title> seems to have been primarily regarded as clearing the State from any guilt that might have been incurred in the eyes of the gods by letting the criminal go unpunished. The exsilium involved in the lesser <seg lang="la">deminutio capitis</seg> (q. v.), or loss of citizenship, if the banished person became citizen of another State; or if the people declared the banishment to be deserved; or if the <seg lang="la">interdictio aquae et ignis</seg> was pronounced after he had gone into exile. It was only in very serious cases that a man's property was also confiscated. Real banishment was first inflicted under the Empire.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
