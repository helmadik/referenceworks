<head orig="Rabirius">Rabirius</head>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, an aged senator, accused in B.C. 63, by T. Labienus, tribune of the plebs, of having put to death the tribune L. Appuleius Saturninus in 100, nearly forty years before. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssaturninus">Saturninus</ref>.) The accusation was set on foot at the instigation of Caesar, who judged it necessary to deter the Senate from resorting to arms against the popular party. The Duumviri Perduellionis (an obsolete tribunal) appointed to try Rabirius were C. Caesar himself and his relative L. Caesar. Rabirius was condemned, but appealed to the people in the Comitia Centuriata. The case excited the greatest interest, since it was not simply the life or death of Rabirius, but the power and authority of the Senate, which were at stake. Rabirius was defended by Cicero; but the eloquence of his advocate was of no avail, and the people would have ratified the decision of the duumvirs had not the meeting been broken up by the praetor, Q. Metellus Celer, who removed the military flag which floated on the Ianiculum.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Rabirius Postŭmus</hi> was the son of the sister of the preceding. After the restoration of Ptolemy Auletes to his kingdom by means of Gabinius in B.C. 55, Rabirius repaired to Alexandria, and was invested by the king with the office of <hi rend="italic">dioecetes</hi>, or chief treasurer. In this office his extortions were so terrible that Ptolemy had him apprehended; but Rabirius escaped from prison, probably through the connivance of the king, and returned to Rome. Here a trial awaited him. Gabinius had been sentenced to pay a heavy fine on account of his extortions in Egypt; and as he was unable to pay this fine, a suit was instituted against Rabirius, who was liable to make up the deficiency, if it could be proved that he had received any of the money of which Gabinius had illegally become possessed. Rabirius was defended by Cicero, and was probably condemned.</p>

 <p> A town in Northern Italy, now Ravenna. An important place in Gallia Cisalpina, on the river Bedesis, and about a mile from the sea, though it is now about five miles in the interior, in consequence of the sea having receded all along this coast. Ravenna was situated in the midst of marshes, and was only accessible in one direction by land, probably by the road leading from Ariminum. It was said to have been founded by Thessalians (Pelasgians), and afterwards to have passed into the hands of the Umbrians, but it long remained an insignificant place, and its greatness does not begin till the time of the empire, when Augustus made it one of the two chief stations of <cb /> the Roman fleet. Ravenna thus suddenly became one of the most important places in the north of Italy. When the Roman Empire was threatened by the barbarians, the emperors of the West took up their residence at Ravenna, which, on account of its situation and fortifications, was regarded as impregnable. After the downfall of the Western Empire, Theodoric also made it the capital of his kingdom; and after the overthrow of the Gothic dominion by Narses, it became the residence of the exarchs, or the governors of the Byzantine Empire in Italy, till the Lombards took the town, A.D. 752. Ravenna is remarkable for its possession of many fine specimens of early Christian art, which may be studied here to great advantage. See Finsler, <bibl default="NO"><title>Ravenna in d. röm.

<head orig="Recitatiōnes">Recitationes</head>

 <p> At Rome books were sometimes read aloud before their publication—a custom introduced in the time of Augustus by Asinius Pollio. At first these readings took place only before friends especially invited; afterwards they were publicly announced, and were held before great assemblies, either in the theatre or at the public baths or in the Forum, admission being open to all. Introduced, in the first instance, with a view to obtaining the criticisms of the audience, to help the author in the final revision of his work, they soon became of such importance that they determined the success of the work so recited.

 <p>(2) M., consul 294, carried on war against the Samnites.</p>
 <p>(3) M., consul 267, conquered the Sallentini, took the town of Brundusium, and obtained in consequence the honour of a triumph. In 256 he was consul a second time with L. Manlius Vulso Longus. The two consuls defeated the Carthaginian fleet, and afterwards landed in Africa with a large force. They met with great and striking success; and after Manlius returned to Rome with half of the army, Regulus remained in Africa with the other half and prosecuted the war with the utmost vigour. The Carthaginian generals Hasdrubal, Bostar, and Hamilcar avoided the plains, where their cavalry and elephants would have given them an advantage over the Roman army, and withdrew into the mountains. There they were attacked by Regulus, and defeated with great loss; 15,000 men are said to have been killed in battle, and 5000 men with 18 elephants to have been taken. The Carthaginian troops retired within the walls of the city, and Regulus now overran the country without opposition. Numerous towns fell into the power of the Romans, and among others Tunis, at the distance of only twenty miles from the capital. The Carthaginians, in despair, sent a herald to Regulus to solicit peace; but the Roman general would only grant it on such intolerable terms that the Carthaginians resolved to continue the war, and hold out to the last. In the midst of their distress and alarm, success came to them from an unexpected quarter. Among the Greek mercenaries who had lately arrived at Carthage was a Lacedaemonian of the name of Xanthippus. He pointed out to the Carthaginians that their defeat was owing to the incompetency of their generals, and not to the superiority of the Roman arms; and he inspired such confidence in the people that he was forthwith <cb /> placed at the head of their troops. Relying on his 4000 cavalry and 100 elephants, Xanthippus boldly marched into the open country to meet the enemy. In the battle which ensued Regulus was totally defeated; 30,000 of his men were slain; scarcely 2000 escaped to Clypea; and Regulus himself was taken prisoner with 500 more (B.C. 255). Regulus remained in captivity for the next five years, till 250, when the Carthaginians, after their defeat by the proconsul Metellus, sent an embassy to Rome to solicit peace, or at least an exchange of prisoners. They allowed Regulus to accompany the ambassadors on the promise that he would return to Rome if their proposals were declined, thinking that he would persuade his countrymen to agree to an exchange of prisoners in order to obtain his own liberty. This mission of Regulus is one of the most celebrated stories in Roman history. The orators and poets related how Regulus at first refused to enter the city as a slave of the Carthaginians; how afterwards he would not give his opinion in the Senate, as he had ceased by his captivity to be a member of that illustrious body; how, at length, when he was allowed by the Romans to speak, he endeavoured to dissuade the Senate from assenting to a peace, or even to an exchange of prisoners, and when he saw them wavering, from their desire of redeeming him from captivity, how he told them that the Carthaginians had given him a slow poison, which would soon terminate his life; and how, finally, when the Senate through his influence refused the offers of the Carthaginians, he firmly resisted all the persuasions of his friends to remain in Rome, and returned to Carthage, where a martyr's death awaited him. On his arrival at Carthage he is said to have been put to death with the most excruciating tortures. <figure id="fig.01361">
<head orig="Coin of a Livineius, with Head of Regulus.">Coin of a Livineius, with Head of Regulus.</head>
</figure> It was related that he was placed in a chest covered over in the inside with iron nails, and thus perished; and other writers stated in addition that after his eyelids had been cut off he was first thrown into a dark dungeon, and then suddenly exposed to the full rays of a burning sun. When the news of the barbarous death of Regulus reached Rome, the Senate is said to have given Hamilcar and Bostar, two of the noblest Carthaginian prisoners, to the family of Regulus, who revenged themselves by putting them to death with cruel torments.</p>
 <p>This celebrated tale, however, has not been allowed to pass without question in modern times. Many writers supposed that it was invented in order to excuse the cruelties perpetrated by the family of Regulus on the Carthaginian prisoners committed to their custody. Regulus was one of the favourite characters of early Roman story. Not only was he celebrated on account of his heroism in giving the Senate advice which secured him a martyr's death, but also on account of his frugality and simplicity of life. Like Fabricius and Curius he lived on his hereditary farm, which he cultivated with his own hands; and subsequent

 ages loved to tell how he petitioned the Senate for his recall from Africa when he was in the full career of victory, as his farm was going to ruin in his absence and his family was suffering from want.

The gods of the Greeks were originally personifications of the powers of nature, limited in their activity to that province of nature from the phenomena of which they are derived. As these phenomena were regarded as acts or sufferings of the gods in question, a cycle of myths was thus developed. In the minds of the people, the special significance of these myths necessarily vanished in proportion as the original connection of the gods with the phenomena of nature receded to the background, while greater prominence was given to the conception of the gods as personal beings holding sway, primarily in their own province of nature, and then beyond those limits, and no longer exclusively in connection with the powers of nature. In the oldest records of the intellectual life of Greece—the Homeric poems—this transition has already been carried out. The Homeric deities are exclusively occupied with the governing of mortals, whose whole life is represented as being under their influence; while traces of the old connection with the phenomena of nature are rarely found, and the old myths had long since become unintelligible tales, in which the actions of the gods appeared unreasonable and immoral, since their meaning was no longer clear. In regard to religion, as in other matters, the Homeric poems are of the utmost importance; for if in historical times a certain uniformity prevails in <cb /> the representation of the deities, this may be traced in no small degree to the influence of Homer and of other poets (especially Hesiod) who were under his influence, and who gave distinct form to the vague representations of an earlier time. Nevertheless this uniformity only existed in a general way; in detail there was the greatest confusion, for the Greeks never attained to a uniform religious system and to fixed religious dogma. They possessed only a contradictory and ambiguous mythology. The only thing which was comparatively established was the traditional worship; but in this there was great diversity of place and time.</p>
 <p>The common belief was that the gods were superhuman, though they were like mortals in form and in the ordinary necessities of life (food, drink, sleep); that they had power over nature and human beings; that all good and evil came from them; that their favour could be obtained by behaviour which was pleasing to them, and lost by that which displeased them. Among the Greek gods there was no representative of evil, neither in popular belief was there one of absolute perfection and holiness; and the deities were represented as being subject to moral weakness and deviation from right—a belief which was fostered by the traditional mythology. The gods possessed immortality, but did not exist from the beginning of all things.</p>
 <p>I. In the opinion of the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greeks</hi>, the ruling race of gods, the Olympians—so called from their abode, Olympus—were the third race of gods. The first ruler was Uranus (Heaven), who, by his mother Gaea (Earth), who bore him spontaneously, himself became the father of the Titans. He was expelled by his son Cronus, whose daughters, by his sister Rhea, were Hestia, Demeter, and Heré, and his sons, Hades (Pluto), Poseidon, and Zeus. He was himself expelled by his last-named son. When Zeus, by the aid of his brothers and sisters, had overcome the Titans, who rebelled against the new order of things, he divided the world with his brothers. The earth and Olympus remained common property; Hades obtained the nether world; Poseidon, the sea; Zeus, the heavens, and, as being the strongest and wisest, he also had authority over all the other gods, who worked his will, received from him their offices and spheres of action, and served him as helpers in the government of the universe. According to this division of province, the gods are divided into the divinities of heaven and earth and sea.</p>
 <p>As in all religions founded on nature, so with the Greeks, the gods of heaven take the first place. They are specially called Olympians; and, in contrast to the gods of the earth and sea, are called the gods above, or the upper gods. The principal deities after Zeus are Heré, Athené, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodité, Hephaestus, Ares, Hermes, and Hestia. Round them are grouped a number of minor deities, who either escort and serve the upper gods (as, for instance, Themis, and the Horae, the Graces, the Muses, Eros, Niké, Iris, Hebé, Ganymede), or else represent distinct phenomena of the heavens, as Helios (the sun), Selené (the moon), Eos (the dawn); or execute special services in the heaven-ordained government of the universe, as the goddess of birth, Eileithyia, the healing god Asclepius, and the goddesses of destiny (Moerae, Nemesis, Tyché). The gods of the sea, besides Poseidon and his spouse Amphitrité and his son Triton, are Oceanus and his offspring, Nereus and 
<pb n="1363" /><cb />
 the Nereids, Protens, Ino (Leucothea), Melicertes (Palaemon), Glancus (Pontius). The gods of the earth are Gaea herself, Rhea (Cybelé), Dionysus, Priapus, Pan, the Nymphs and Satyrs, Demeter and her daughter Persephoné, with her spouse Hades (Pluto). The last two are the rulers of the nether world, to which Hecaté and the Erinyes also belong.</p>
 <p>The number of beings regarded as deities was never clearly defined. From the earliest times in Greece we find deities worshipped in one place who were not known in another. But some of these, as Dionysus and Pau, became common property in course of time; and the more lasting and more extensive the intercourse became with other peoples, more especially in the colonies, the introduction of foreign deities became greater. Some of these were identified with the gods already worshipped, while others preserved their original attributes, subject, of course, to modifications to suit the spirit of the Greeks. This aptitude for naturalizing foreign religions declined more and more as Greece ceased to flourish. On the other hand, some original deities lost their independence, and were merged into others, such as Helios and Apollo, Selené and Artemis. In the popular belief of the post-Homeric time, another numerous class of superhuman beings sprang up, which were regarded as being between gods and men, the demons (<foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign>) and Heroes. See <ref type="cross" target="crossheros">Heros</ref>.</p>
 <p>As to their nature and their number, there was less uniformity than in the case of the real gods. The Heroes had only local importance. Even in the case of the gods universally worshipped, it was by no means all (not even the most important) that had a place everywhere in the public worship. In the case of certain gods, their worship was only exceptional; and those gods who by order of the State were worshipped in any particular place did not necessarily enjoy forever the position to which they were entitled. Even Zeus, who was universally regarded as the highest of the gods, and figured in the cult of most of the different States, was not himself worshipped as supreme; but those gods who had always had the first place in the cult of the respective States took precedence over him, and these were not always divinities of preëminent importance. In Athens, Pallas Athené was worshipped as the principal deity, Heré in Argos; among the Dorians, especially at Delphi, Apollo; among the Iouians, Poscidon; at Rhodes, Helios; at Naxos, Dionysus; at Thespiae, Eros; at Orchomenus, the Charites (or Graces). Even in the case of the same deities, the local customs often differed considerably in respect of the names that were given to them, their attributes, and the form of worship. These differences were due partly to local causes and local opinions, partly to foreign influence, and were occasionally so considerable that doubts arose whether different deities were not really represented under the same name, as, for instance, Aphrodité.</p>
 <p>The deities were supposed to be specially gratified by the careful observance of the traditional ritual. This continued to be carried on according to ancient custom, so that the details of these ancient cults were often curious, and their connection with the religious ideas on which they rested was often unintelligible. However, with the development of morality the view began to prevail that the observance of duties towards the State and <cb /> fellow-men was also favoured by the gods as guardians of the providential order of the world; but, in the eyes of the multitude, the principal meaning of <foreign lang="greek">εὐδέβεια</foreign> (piety) was the performance of the ordained worship of the gods. Again, the care of the State was confined to the outward forms of religion and to the maintenance of the traditional legal ritual. Alterations in this ritual and the introduction of new cults were only made by authority of the legislative power, usually after an oracle had been consulted to determine the divine will. Besides the worship of the deities recognized by the State, private objects of devotion were found everywhere. For instance, in the case of foreign deities at Athens, where there were many strangers either passing through or permanently resident, foreign religions were tolerated so long as they did not endanger the traditional worship or excite public disturbance by their outward ritual. Many such cults were naturalized in this way, and became, in course of time, part of the State religion. Conquest, again, contributed largely towards the introduction of novelties, for the acquisition of new territory involved that of the religions rites held therein. And, lastly, old religions, which had been looked upon as supremely holy, even if they were not absolutely superseded in the course of time, became less important in comparison with others of later origin.</p>
 <p>Shrines, and the statues of the gods preserved in them, were the central points of the worship of the different deities. As long as the gods were not represented as having human form, stones, especially those fallen from heaven, or blocks of wood, were the objects of worship. By various stages of progress the gods were at length represented by actual images. At first they were made of wood, then of stone and metal. Clay, and even wax, were generally used for private objects of devotion. Though the real purpose of these symbols and images was to represent the divinity to the worshippers by means of a visible sign, nevertheless, in the popular belief, it was generally presumed that the divinity was actively present in them. Accordingly, the welfare of the State was often supposed to be bound up with the possession of certain symbols and images of the gods.</p>
 <p>The decline of the Greek religion began with the decline of the State after the Peloponnesian War. Although the philosophers had already directed their assault against the belief of the people, which, with its authropomorphism and its inconsistency, exposed itself in many ways to the attacks of the critical spirit, yet the faith of the multitude in the old gods remained unshaken, for it had long attributed the deliverance from the perils of the Persian Wars to their mighty and merciful influence. But after the Peloponnesian War the notions of the philosophers gained ground among the people and undermined the old belief, without, however, supplying any alternative to the religious feeling, which could no longer be satisfied with the outward forms of worship which still survived. With unbelief superstition came in, which was fostered (especially after the Macedonian epoch) by the foreign and barbarous cults, and the degencrate forms of mysticism which were imported from Asia and Egypt.</p>
 <p>II. The Italian tribes, from which the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi> people sprang, had a common origin with the Greeks and a common foundation of religious 
<pb n="1364" /><cb />
 ideas; but on Italian soil these religious ideas received an essentially different direction. Like the Greeks, the Italians regarded the deities as persons separated as to sex and united in couples; but while the imaginative Greeks saw in their gods ideal forms full of individual life, the more sober mind of the Italian tribes, especially of the Romans, got no further than the abstract. Holding to the fundamental idea, they worshipped in the gods the abstract powers of nature, under whose influence man believed himself to be at every moment. The original Italian gods were grave and venerable, and, in a certain sense, more moral than those of the Greeks; but they lacked plastic form and poetic beauty. Accordingly, it is only with certain reservations that we can speak of a Roman mythology in a sense corresponding to that of the Greeks. The Romans lacked an Olympus and a Hades, and knew nothing of stories about the race and relationship and the love affairs of their deities. In this abstract nature of the Roman gods, it is intelligible that the Romans, during the first two hundred years from the foundation of Rome, possessed no images of their gods, but represented them by symbols—e. g. Iupiter by a flint-stone, Mars by a spear, Vesta by fire, which, even in later times, remained the symbol of the goddess. In the earliest Roman religion the deities of two Italian races, the Latins and the Sabines, were united, Rome having been originally peopled by the union of these tribes. The most important gods were the god of light and the god of all beginning, Ianus; the god of heaven, Iupiter, the greatest protector of the nation, with whom was joined the feminine element in Iuno, just as Iana (Diana) was connected with Ianus; Mars, originally the protector of agriculture, the ancestral god of the Latin race; Quirinus, originally the corresponding god of the Sabines; and Vesta, the goddess of the hearth of the State. Besides these principal deities, others were worshipped as patrons of the farmers and shepherds. Their activity extended over the earth, the fields, and the woods; they blessed the fruits of the field and garden, and gave prosperity to the cattle. Such were Tellus, Ceres, Saturnus and Ops, Liber and Libera, Faunus, Silvanus, Flora, Vertumnus, Pomona. The gods of the sea, however, who had such an important position in the Grecian mythology, had not nearly the same importance in Roman ideas as the gods of heaven and earth, for in the earliest times the sea was little regarded by the Romans. Another object of religious worship was the gods of the house and family, the Lares and Penates. But, besides these, there was an unlimited number of divine beings; for the Romans assumed that there were divine representatives of every inanimate or animate object, of every action and every event. Not only did every human being possess a special protector (<seg lang="la">genius</seg>, q. v.), but a number of deities watched over his development from conception to birth, and his further growth, mentally and bodily. See <ref type="cross" target="crossindigitamenta">Indigitamenta</ref>.</p>
 <p>Again, there were manifold protecting gods for the different events of life, as Tutanus and Tutilina, who were invoked in times of trouble; Orbona, invoked by childless couples; and Febris, the goddess of fever. There were also separate gods for separate employments, and for the places where they were carried on. In this way the different institutions and phases of agriculture possessed <cb /> special deities such as Robigus and Robigo, protectors of the crops against blight. So, also, with the different branches of cattle-breeding (Bubona, goddess of the breeding of horned cattle; Epona, goddess of the breeding of horses; Pales, of the breeding of sheep). Similarly with the separate parts of a house: Forculus, god of the door; Cardea, goddess of the hinge; Limentinus and Limentina, deities of the threshold. To these divine beings fresh ones were continually added, as the inclination of the Romans to recognize and trace divine influence in every single event led to the establishment of new cults after every new revelation of divine power. In this way the introduction of bronze coinage led to a <title>deus Aesculanus</title>, and later that of silver coinage to a <title>deus Argentinus.</title> Historical events gave an impulse to the personification of intellectual and moral qualities, such as Concordia, Honos, Virtus, Mens, etc. The same principle which recognized that there were some gods unknown, or, at any rate, not worshipped at Rome, led to the tolerance of private performance of foreign cults. Hence, also, it came about that the gods of conquered countries found a place in the Roman state religion, and occasionally were even introduced into the actual worship of Rome. In the latter case, however, the home deities preserved their rights in so far as the shrines of the newly imported deities were outside the limits of what was called the <ref type="cross" target="crosspomerium">Pomerium</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>The religion of the Romans was gradually but completely altered by the influence of that of the Greeks. This influence made itself felt as early as the time of the latest kings. Shrines of the gods were first introduced under the elder Tarquin, and under the last Tarquin three supreme gods of the State were established—Iupiter, the representative of supreme power; Iuno, of supreme womanhood; Minerva, of supreme wisdom. These three deities received, as a token of their inseparability, a common temple on the Capitol, and were therefore called the Capitoline gods. This Greek influence was firmly established at the end of the time of the kings by the Sibylline Books, which originated among the Greeks of Asia Minor. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibyllae</ref>.) By means of these a number of Greek and Asiatic gods were in course of time introduced into the Roman cult, partly as new deities, such as Apollo, Cybelé (<title>Magna Mater</title>), Aesculapius; partly under the names of native gods, with whom they were often identified in a very superficial way, as Demeter with Ceres, Dionysus with Liber, Persephoné with Libera, Aphrodité with Venus; and with them were introduced many innovations in the old established worship of the gods, especially the <title>Lectisternium</title> (q. v.). When, after the Second Punic War, Greek ideas irresistibly made their way in Rome, it became more and more common to identify the gods of Rome with those of Greece; and thus the original significance of many Roman deities was either obscured or even entirely lost. Divinities highly venerated of old were put into the background, and those of less importance came to be regarded as supreme, owing to their supposed analogy to Greek gods. In this way the following twelve were established by analogy to the Greek form of religion: Iupiter (Zeus), Iuno (Heré), Neptunus (Poseidon), Minerva (Athené), Mars (Ares), Venus (Aphrodité), Apollo, Diana (Artemis), Vulcanus (Hephaestus), Vesta (Hestia), Mercurius (Hermes), and Ceres (Demeter). 
<pb n="1365" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The Roman religion was from the beginning an affair of State. Religious, as well as political, institutions emanated from the kings, who, as high priests, organized the worship by law and laid the foundation of a law of ritual. The second king, Numa, was regarded as the real founder of the Roman cult, and of the priesthood charged with the carrying out of the same. After the kings had been abolished, religion was still controlled by the State, and the priests continued to be State officials, who were empowered by the State, on the one hand, to superintend the performance of the different cults, and, on the other (and this was the more important office), to give judgment in all matters of religion. They thus exercised considerable influence. Under the Republic, the royal prerogative of formulating decrees in all matters of religion was transferred to the Senate. As the Roman State in early times was exclusively composed of patricians, the public religion was originally their exclusive property; the plebs were not allowed to participate in that religion, and were only allowed to worship the Roman gods in private. Therefore, in the long struggle in which the plebs, with their ever-increasing power, endeavoured to secure their rights (a struggle that ended in B.C. 300), it was a question of religion as well as of politics. As regards the worship of the gods, according to Roman ideas, a pure and moral life was pleasing to them and gained their favour. This was, however, conditional on the exact performance of the outward ritual which the system of religion ordained for their cult. It consisted in a very prolonged ceremonial, performed according to the strictest injunctions and with painful minuteness of detail. This ceremonial was performed in public and private life, so that no community lacked its special shrines and sacrifices (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssacra">Sacra</ref>), and nothing of any importance was undertaken without religious sanction, which involved in particular the discovery of the divine will by means of certain signs (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaugur">Augur</ref>). The forms of outward worship were retained long after the decay of belief in the gods had set in. This decay was caused by the preponderance of the Greek element, and the contemporary introduction of Greek enlightenment; and it soon spread to the forms of worship. During the greater part of the republican period, the priests allowed religion to take a secondary place to politics, and, either from indifference or ignorance, neglected their official duties. Under the Empire, when the deification of deceased emperors was introduced (see <ref type="cross" target="crossapotheosis">Apotheosis</ref>), an attempt was made to give an artificial life to the ancient forms of worship; but religious feeling could not be rekindled by forms which had long lost their meaning. When this feeling revived, it preferred, as in Greece, to find refuge in strange Oriental rites, especially those of Mithras and of Isis and Serapis, which, by means of their mysteries and their expiatory ceremonies, offered a certain degree of satisfaction, though, at the same time, they led the way to every conceivable kind of superstition.</p>
 <p>The suppression of paganism began in the fourth century, from the time when Constantine decided in favour of Christianity, in A.D. 324. It commenced in the eastern half of the Roman Empire, while in the western half, and at Rome in particular, the Roman form of worship remained essentially undisturbed until the reign of Theodosius <cb /> the Great (379-395), the resolute exterminator of paganism. In A.D. 394 the Olympic Games were held for the last time; in Rome the endowment of all public forms of worship out of the funds of the State was withdrawn, the priests were driven from the temples, and the temples closed. Nevertheless certain heathen customs long survived, such as the auguries of the consuls and some few festivals that admitted of being celebrated without offering sacrifice or entering a temple. Thus the Lupercalia were not abolished until 494, when they were transformed into a Christian festival.</p>

<head orig="Renaissance">Renaissance</head>

 <p> A name given to the great intellectual movement in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries—a period which saw the transition from the Middle Ages to modern times. It began in the revolt of men of culture against the intellectual sterility and narrowness of the mediaeval spirit, and especially against scholasticism, whose pedantic and dogmatic narrowness had reached the extreme point of its development. The Renaissance began in Italy, and its first period <bibl default="NO">(1300 to 1375)</bibl> was marked by a universal revival of interest in classic literature and the classic ideals. It was a great revolt against bigotry and in favor of mental freedom, and its first sign was a passion for the largeness and richness of the pagan world. Traces of this feeling can be seen in Dante <bibl default="NO">(1265-1321)</bibl>, who, although thoroughly mediaeval in his sympathies, chose Vergil as his model, and who, in the vigour and magnificence of his own verse, was a striking contrast to the dull formalists who had before his time written for the men of the Middle Age. Petrarch <bibl default="NO">(1304-1374)</bibl> is the first true son of the Renaissance. In his poem written in Latin hexameter on the subject of the Second Punic War and entitled <title>Africa</title>, he boldly followed the classic models, as he suggested the ancient Roman grace and freedom in his Italian <title>Rime.</title> He travelled in foreign countries and thus knew a larger world than his predecessors; and he may be said to have rediscovered Greek, which for some six centuries had been lost to the western world. His friend and disciple Boccaccio studied that language, and by his master's advice made a translation of Homer into Latin. Greeks were now encouraged to come from Constantinople to Italy, and in 1396 the learned Manuel Chysoloras began to teach in the chair of Greek founded at the instance of Salutato and Palla degli Strozzi at Florence. A Platonic academy was opened in the same city under the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici. Greek texts were brought from Constantinople, Europe was ransacked for copies of the long unused Latin classics, copyists multiplied them, libraries were founded, and schools for the study of both Greek and Latin in their classic forms were opened at Rome, Mantua, Verona, and many other towns. Pope Nicholas V. earnestly fostered the new movement, and laid the foundation of the great Vatican collection; Cardinal Bessarion greatly aided in the formation of the Library of St. Mark at Venice. Individual scholars went about looking for manuscripts of lost authors, for coins, medals, bronzes— anything that could give a better knowledge of classical antiquity. Among these men, the most famous were Poggio Bracciolini, who brought to light once more Quintilian, Lucretius, part of Cicero, Columella, Vitruvius, Silius Italicus and Asconius; and Cyriacus of Ancona, who sounded the key-note of the new movement in his famous saying, “I go to awake the dead.” See <ref type="cross" target="crossbracciolini">Bracciolini</ref>.</p>
 <p>The second period of the Renaissance begins about 1375, and is marked by a continued zeal for classical study, and by the development of a broad learning and the new view of the intellectual life <cb /> which is known as Humanism. By this time the movement had spread to Germany and France and the northern countries generally, where it developed into the wide scholarship and sound learning of men like <ref type="cross" target="crosserasmus">Erasmus</ref> (q.v.), Melanchthon, <ref type="cross" target="crossreuchlin">Reuchlin</ref> (q.v.), the Scaligers, Muretus, and Casaubon. The movement had now gone far beyond the mere revival of classical studies, and was felt in every department of life. In philosophy it gradually replaced the purely formal methods of thought that scholasticism had fostered; in science it led to the great discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus; in architecture it brought about the revival of the classic style; in art it developed the new school of painting of which Michael Angelo and Raphael in Italy were the great names, and still another school in the Netherlands and Flanders; in religion its influence is seen in the revolt of Luther; and it indirectly inspired the passion for exploration that led to the discovery of the New World.</p>

 <p> (from <seg lang="la">repetundae pecuniae</seg>, “money which is ordered to be restored”). The name given by the Romans to the charge brought against officials for extorting money from Roman subjects or allies. Such charges were at first brought before the Senate, which heard the case itself, or else passed it on to a commission, or, again, caused it to be brought before the Comitia by the tribunes. At last, in B.C. 149, a standing court of justice (see <ref type="cross" target="crossquaestio">Quaestio perpetua</ref>), in fact, the first in Rome, was instituted by the Lex Calpurnia, containing more precise definitions of acts liable to punishment, with forms of legal procedure, and determining the amount of the penalty. The increasing inclination of the officials to use the administration of the provinces as means of enriching themselves at the expense of the provincials led to repeated legislation with a view to increasing the penalty. The last law on the subject was Caesar's Lex Iulia, which was the basis of the procedure in such cases under the Empire. During that period, in consequence of the improved condition of provincial government, extortion on the part of officials became much rarer. Such extortion was generally punished by a fine of four times the amount extorted. It was also attended with a certain degree of disgrace (<seg lang="la">infamia</seg>), even if a still more severe punishment were not

By far the most important application of network was to the three kindred arts of fowling, hunting, and fishing. In fowling the use of nets was comparatively limited. In hunting it was usual to extend nets in a curved line of considerable length, so as in part to surround a space into which the beasts of chase, such as the hare, the boar, the deer, the lion, and the bear, were driven through the opening left on one side. This range of nets was flanked by cords, to which feathers dyed scarlet and of other bright colors were tied, so as to flare and flutter in the wind. The hunters then sallied forth with their dogs, dislodged the animals from their coverts, and by shouts and barking drove them first within the <seg lang="la">formido</seg>, as the apparatus of <cb /> string and feathers was called, and then, as they were scared with this appearance, within the circuit of the nets.

<head orig="Rex">Rex</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βασιλεύς, ἄναξ</foreign>). A king. <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—In the Heroic Age, as depicted in the poems of Homer, the kingly form of government was universal. The authority of these kings and its limitations were derived not from any definite scheme or written code, but from the force of traditionary usage and the natural influence of the circumstances in which the kings were placed, surrounded as they were by a body of chiefs and nobles, whose power was but little inferior to that of the kings themselves. Even the title <foreign lang="greek">βασιλῆες</foreign> is applied to them as well as to the king. The maintenance of regal authority doubtless depended greatly on the possession of personal superiority in bravery, military prowess, wisdom in council, and eloquence in debate. When old age had blunted his powers and activity, a king ran a great chance of losing his influence. There was, however, an undefined notion of a sort of divine right connected with the kingly office, whence the epithet <foreign lang="greek">διοτρεφής</foreign>, so commonly applied to kings in Homer. The characteristic emblem of the kingly office was the <foreign lang="greek">σκῆπτρον</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssceptrum">Sceptrum</ref>.) Our information respecting the Grecian kings in the more historical age is not ample or minute enough to enable us to draw out a detailed scheme of their functions. Respecting the kings of Sparta the reader is referred to the article <ref type="cross" target="crossephori">Ephori</ref>. As an illustration of the gradual limitation of the prerogatives of the king or chief magistrate, the reader may consult the article <ref type="cross" target="crossarchon">Archon</ref>. The title basileus was sometimes applied to an officer who discharged the priestly functions of the more ancient kings, as in Athens. See <ref type="cross" target="crossarchon">Archon</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—Rome was originally governed by kings. All the ancient writers agree in representing the king as elected by the people for life, and as voluntarily intrusted by them with the supreme power in the State. No reference is made to the hereditary principle in the election of the first four kings; and it is not until the fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus, obtained the sovereignty that anything is said about the children of the deceased king. Since the people had conferred the regal power, it returned to them upon the death of the king. But as a new king could not be immediately appointed, an Interrex forthwith stepped into his place. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossinterreges">Interreges</ref>.) The necessity for an immediate successor to the king arose from the circumstance that he alone had had the power of taking the <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg> on behalf of the State; and as the <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg> devolved upon the people at his death, it was imperative upon them to create a magistrate to whom they could delegate the <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg>, and who would thus possess the power of mediating between the gods and the State. Originally the peoples consisted only of the <seg lang="la">patres</seg> or <seg lang="la">patricii;</seg> and accordingly, on the death of the king, we read <seg lang="la">res ad patres redit</seg>, or, what is nearly the same thing, <seg lang="la">auspicia ad patres redeunt.</seg> The Interrex was elected by the whole body of the patricians, and he appointed (<seg lang="la">prodebat</seg>) his successor, as it was a rule that the first Interrex could not hold the Comitia for the election; but it frequently happened that the second Interrex appointed a third, the third a fourth, <cb /> and so on, till the election took place. The Interrex presided over the Comitia Curiata, which were assembled for the election of the king. The person whom the Senate had selected was proposed by the Interrex to the people in a regular <seg lang="la">rogatio</seg>, which the people could only accept or reject, for they had not the initiative and could not themselves propose any name. If the people voted in favour of the rogation, they were said <seg lang="la">creare regem</seg>, and their acceptance of him was called <seg lang="la">iussus populi.</seg> But the king did not immediately enter upon his office. Two other acts had still to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power. First his <seg lang="la">inauguratio</seg> had to be performed, as it was necessary to obtain the divine will respecting his appointment by means of the <seg lang="la">auspices</seg>, since he was the high-priest of the people. The ceremony was performed by an augur, who conducted the newly-elected king to the Arx, or citadel, and there placed him on a stone seat with his face turned to the south, while the people waited below in anxious suspense until the augur announced that the gods had sent the favourable tokens confirming the king in his priestly character. The <seg lang="la">inauguratio</seg> did not confer upon him the <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg>, for these he obtained by his election to the royal office, as the Comitia were held <seg lang="la">auspicato.</seg> The second act which had to be performed was the conferring of the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> upon the king. The <seg lang="la">curiae</seg> had only determined by their previous vote who was to be king, and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power upon him; they had, therefore, to grant him the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> by a distinct vote. Accordingly the king himself proposed to the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg> a <seg lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</seg>, and the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg> by voting in favor of it gave him the <seg lang="la">imperium.</seg> Livy in his first book makes no mention of the <seg lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</seg>, but he uses the expressions <seg lang="la">patres auctores fierunt, patres auctores facti;</seg> and these expressions are equivalent to the <seg lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</seg> in the kingly period. The king possessed the supreme power in the earliest times, and the Senate and the Comitia Curiata were very slight checks upon its exercise. In the first place, the king alone possessed the right of taking the auspices on behalf of the State; and as no public business of any kind could be performed without the approbation of the gods expressed by the auspices, the king stood as mediator between the gods and the people, and in an early stage of society must necessarily have been regarded with religious awe. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugur">Augur</ref>.) Secondly, the people surrendered to the king the supreme military and judicial authority by conferring the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> upon him. The king was not only the commander in war, but the supreme judge in peace. Seated on his throne in the Comitium, he administered justice to all comers, and decided in all cases which were brought before him, civil as well as criminal. Again, all the magistrates in the kingly period appear to have been appointed by the king and not elected by the <seg lang="la">curiae.</seg> Further, the king was not dependent upon the people for his support; but a large portion of the public land belonged to him, which was cultivated at the expense of the State on his behalf. He had also the absolute disposal of the booty taken in war and of the conquered lands. It must not, however, be supposed that the authority of the king was absolute. The Senate and the assembly of the people must have formed some check upon his power. But these were not independent 
<pb n="1369" /><cb />
 bodies possessing the right of meeting at certain times and discussing questions of State. They could only be called together when the king chose, and, further, could only determine upon matters which the king submitted to them. The only public matter in which the king could not dispense with the coöperation of the Senate and the <seg lang="la">curiae</seg> was in declarations of war. There is no trace of the people having had anything to do with the conclusion of treaties of peace. The insignia of the king were the <seg lang="la">fasces</seg> with the axes (<seg lang="la">secures</seg>), which twelve lictors carried before him as often as he appeared in public, the <seg lang="la">trabea</seg>, the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, and the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg> and <seg lang="la">picta.</seg> The <seg lang="la">trabea</seg> appears to have been the most ancient official dress, and is assigned especially to Romulus: it was of Latin origin, and is therefore represented by Vergil as worn by the Latin kings. The <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg> and <seg lang="la">picta</seg> were borrowed, together with the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, from the Etruscans, and their introduction is variously ascribed to Tullus Hostilius or Tarquinius Priscus.</p>

<head orig="Rex Sacrōrum">Rex Sacrorum</head>

 <p> (or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Rex Sacrificŭlus</hi>), “the king of sacrifices.” The name given by the Romans to a priest who, after the abolition of the royal power, had to perform certain religious rites connected with the name of king. He resembles the King Archon of the Athenian constitution. He was always a patrician, was chosen for life by the Pontifex Maximus with the assistance of the whole pontifical college (of which he became a member), and was inaugurated by the augurs. Although he was externally of high rank and, like the Pontifex Maximus, had an official residence in the Regia, the royal abode of Numa, and took the chair at the feasts and other festivities of the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi>, yet in his religious authority he ranked below the Pontifex Maximus, and was not allowed to hold any public office, or even to address the people in public. His wife (like the wives of the flamens) participated in the priesthood. Our information as to the details of the office is imperfect. Before the knowledge of the calendar became public property, it was the duty of the Rex Sacrorum to summon the people to the Capitol on the Calends and Nones of each month, and to announce the festivals for the month. On the Calends he and the <seg lang="la">regina</seg> sacrificed, and at the same time invoked Ianus. Of the other sacrifices known to us we may mention the Regifugium on Feb. 24th, when the Rex Sacrorum sacrificed at the Comitium, and then fled in haste. This has been erroneously explained as a commemoration of the flight of Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the Roman kings; but it is much more probably one of the customs handed down from the time of the kings themselves, and perhaps connected with the purificatory sacrifice from which the month of February derived its name. At the end of the Republic the office, owing to the political disability attaching to the holder, proved unattractive, and was sometimes left unfilled; but under Augustus it appears to have been restored to fresh dignity, and in imperial times it continued to exist, at any rate, as late as the third century.

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Raetia</hi> (the latter is preferable). A Roman province south of the Danube, was originally distinct from Vindelicia, and was bounded on the west by the Helvetii, on the east by Noricum, on the north by Vindelicia, and on the south by Cisalpine Gaul, thus corresponding to the Grisons in Switzerland, and to the greater part of the Tyrol. Towards the end of the first century, however, Vindelicia was added to the province of Rhaetia, whence Tacitus speaks of Augusta Vindelicorum as situated in Rhaetia. At a later time Rhaetia was subdivided into two provinces, Rhaetia Prima and Rhaetia Secunda, the former of which answered to the old province of Rhaetia, and the latter to Vindelicia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvindelicia">Vindelicia</ref>.) Through Rhaetia runs the principal chain of the Alps called the Alpes Rhaeticae. In it rise some of the great rivers of Northern Italy—the Athesis (Adige) and the Addua (Adda)—besides the Oenus (Irn). The early inhabitants of Rhaetia were said to be Etruscans, and down to a late date a dialect of Etruscan was spoken in parts of the country. (See Strabo, pp. 204, 292, 313; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

<div2 id="crossrhapsodus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Rhapsōdus">Rhapsodus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ῥαψῳδός</foreign>). A Greek term derived from <foreign lang="greek">ῥάβδω</foreign>, originally designating the man who adapted the words to the epic song—i. e. the epic poet himself, who in the earlier time recited his own poetry. Afterwards the term especially denoted one who made the poems of others a subject of recitation.</p>
 <p>At first such rhapsodists were generally poets themselves; but, with the gradual dying out of epic poetry, they came to hold the same position as was afterwards held by the actors, professionally declaiming the lays of the epic poets. Epic verses were originally sung to musical accompaniment, but after the time of Terpander, as lyric poetry became more independently cultivated, the accompaniment of stringed instruments fell into disuse; and then gradually, instead of a song-like recitation, a simple declamation, in which the rhapsodist held a branch of bay in his hand, came to be generally adopted. This had happened even before the time of Plato and Aristotle (see especially Plato's <title>Ion</title>). As in earlier times the singers moved from place to place, in order to get a hearing <cb /> at the courts of princes or before festive gatherings, so the rhapsodists also led an unsettled and wandering life. At Athens ( <title>Leocr.</title> 102) and many other towns, as at Sicyon, before the time of the tyrant Clisthenes ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 67</bibl>), public recitations of the Homeric poems were appointed, at which the rhapsodists competed with one another for definite prizes, and thus found opportunity to display their art. It is true that other epic poems, and even the iambic poetry of Archilochus and Simonides of Amorgus, were also recited by rhapsodists; still at all times the labours of such reciters continued to be devoted in the first place to Homeric poetry (Pindar, <bibl n="Pind. N. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>ii. 2</bibl>; Plato, <bibl n="Eur. Ion 530" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ion</title>, 530</bibl>D; <bibl n="Plato Rep. 599" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>599</bibl>E; <title>Phaedr.</title> 252 B). Hence they were also called Homeridae and Homeristae (Aristot. in <title>Athenaeus</title>, 620 B). It was to the older rhapsodists that the Homeric poems primarily owed their wide diffusion among the Greeks. In the course of time the high esteem in which the rhapsodists originally stood began to decline, because many practised their art as a matter of business and in a purely mechanical fashion. Still their employment survived long beyond the classical time, and not only did the public competition continue to exist, but it was also the custom to introduce rhapsodists at banquets and on other occasions.

<head orig="Rhea">Rhea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ῥέα</foreign>, Ep. and Ion. <foreign lang="greek">Ῥεία, Ῥείη, Ῥέη</foreign>). A goddess whom the Greek legends identify as a representation of the fruitfulness of nature. She was the daughter of Uranus and Gaea, wife of her brother, the Titan Cronus, by whom she gave birth to the Olympian gods, Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Heré, Hestia, Demeter. For this reason she was generally called the “mother of the gods.” One of her oldest places of worship was Crete, where in a cave, near the town of Lyctus or else on Mounts Dircé or Ida, she was said to have given birth to <ref type="cross" target="crosszeus">Zeus</ref> (q.v.), and to have hidden him from the wiles of Cronus. The task of watching and nursing the new-born child she had intrusted to her devoted servants the Curetes, earth-born demons, armed with weapons of bronze, who drowned the cry of the child by the noise which they made by beating their spears against their shields. The name of Curetes was accordingly given to the priests of the Cretan Rhea and of the Idaean Zeus, who executed noisy war-dances at the festivals of those gods. In early times the Cretan Rhea was identified with the Asiatic <ref type="cross" target="crosscybele">Cybĕlé</ref> or <ref type="cross" target="crosscybebe">Cybēbé</ref>, “the Great Mother,” a goddess of the powers of nature and the arts of cultivation, who was worshipped upon mountains in Mysia, Lydia, and Phrygia.</p>
 <p>In the former character she was a symbol of the procreative power of nature; in the latter, she originated the cultivation 
<pb n="1371" /><cb />
 of the vine and agriculture, together with all forms of social progress and civilization, which depend upon these. Thus she was regarded as the founder of towns and cities, and therefore it is that art represents her as crowned with a diadem of towers.</p>
 <p>The true home of this religion was the Phrygian Pessinus, on the river Sangarius, in the district afterwards known as Galatia, where the goddess was called Agdistis (Strabo, p. 567) or Angdistis, from a holy rock named Agdus upon Mount Dindymus above the town. Upon this mountain, after which the goddess derived her name of Dindymené, stood her earliest sanctuary as well as her oldest effigy (a stone that had fallen from heaven), and the grave of her beloved <ref type="cross" target="crossattis">Attis</ref> (q.v.). Her priests, the emasculated Galli, here enjoyed almost royal <figure id="fig.01371">
<head orig="Rhea, or Cybelé. (From a Roman Lamp.)">Rhea, or Cybele. (From a Roman Lamp.)</head>
</figure> honour. In Lydia she was worshipped, principally on Mount Tmolus, as the mother of Zeus and the foster-mother of Dionysus. There was also a temple of Cybelé at Sardis. Her mythical train was formed by the Corybantes, answering to the Curetes of the Cretan Rhea; these were said to accompany her over the wooded hills, with lighted torches and with wild dances, amid the resounding music of flutes and horns and drums and cymbals. After these the priests of Cybelé were also called Corybantes, and the festivals of the goddess were celebrated with similar orgies, in the frenzy of which the participators wounded each other or, like Attis, mutilated themselves. Besides these there were begging priests, called Metragyrtae and Cybebi, who roamed from place to place as inspired servants and prophets of the Great Mother. On the Hellespont and on the Propontis, Rhea-Cybelé was likewise the chief goddess; in particular in the Troad, where she was worshipped upon Mount Ida as “the Idaean Mother,” and where the Idaean <ref type="cross" target="crossdactyli">Dactyli</ref> (q.v.) formed her train. From Asia this religion advanced into Greece. After the Persian Wars it reached Athens, where in the Metroum, the temple of the Great Mother, which was used as a State record-office, there stood the ideal image of the goddess fashioned by Phidias (Pausan. i. 3. 5). The worship of Cybelé did not, however, obtain public recognition here, any more than in the rest of Greece, on account of its orgiastic excesses and the offensive habits of its begging priests. It was cultivated only by particular associations and by the lower ranks of the people.</p>
 <p>In <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Rome</ref> the worship of the Great Mother (<title>Magna Mater</title>) was introduced for political reasons in B.C. 204, at the command of a Sibylline Oracle, and <cb /> for the purpose of driving Hannibal out of Italy. An embassy was sent to bring the holy stone from Pessinus; a festival was founded in honour of the goddess, to be held on April 2-4 (the Megalesia, from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Μεγάλη Μήτηρ</foreign>=<seg lang="la">magna mater</seg>); and in 217 a temple on the Palatine was dedicated to her. The service was performed by a Phrygian priest, a Phrygian priestess, and a number of Galli (emasculated priests of Cybelé), who were allowed to pass in procession through the city in accordance with their native rites. Roman citizens were forbidden to participate in this service, though the praetor on the Palatine and private persons among the patricians celebrated the feast by entertaining one another, the new cult being attached to that of Maia or Ops. The worship of Cybelé gained by degrees an ever-wider extension, so that under the early Empire a fresh festival was instituted, from March 15-27, with the observance of mourning, followed by the most extravagant joy. In this festival associations of women and men and the religious board of the <ref type="cross" target="crossquindecimviri">Quindecimviri</ref> (q.v.) took part. In the first half of the second century A.D. the Taurobolia and Criobolia were added. In these ceremonies the person concerned went through a form of baptism with the blood of bulls and rams killed in sacrifice, with the object of cleansing him from pollutions and bringing about a new birth. The oak and pine were sacred to Rhea-Cybelé (see <ref type="cross" target="crossattis">Attis</ref>), as also the lion. She was supposed to traverse the mountains riding on a lion, or in a chariot drawn by lions. In art she was usually represented enthroned between two lions, with the mural crown on her head and a small drum in her hand.

Rhegium never recovered its former greatness, though it still continued to be a place of considerable importance. The Rhegians having applied to Rome for assistance when Pyrrhus was in the south of Italy, the Romans placed in the town a garrison of 4000 soldiers, who had been levied among the Latin colonies in Campania.

 <p>These troops seized the town in B.C. 279, killed or expelled the male inhabitants, and took possession of their wives and children. The Romans were too much engaged at the time with their war against Pyrrhus to take notice of this outrage; but when Pyrrhus was driven out of Italy they took signal vengeance upon these Campanians, and restored the surviving Rhegians to their city. Rhegium was the place from which persons usually crossed over to Sicily, but the spot at which they embarked was called Columna Rhegina (Torre di Cavallo), and was 100 stadia north of the town See Axt, <bibl default="NO"><title>Zur Topographie von Rhegion und Messana</title> (Grimma, 1887)</bibl>.

<head orig="Rhenus">Rhenus</head>

 <p> (<title>Rhein</title> in German, <title>Rhine</title> in English). (1) One of the great rivers in Europe, forming in ancient times the boundary between Gaul and Germany, rises in Mount Adulas (St. Gothard), not far from the sources of the Rhone, and flows first in a westerly direction, passing through the Lacus Brigantinus (Lake of Constance) till it reaches Basilia (Basle), where it takes a northerly direction, and eventually flows into the ocean by several mouths. The ancients spoke of two main arms into which the Rhine was divided on entering the territory of the Batavi, of which the one on the east continued to bear the name of Rhenus, while that on the west, into which the Mosa (Maas or Meuse) flowed, was called Vahalis (Waal). After Drusus, in B.C. 12, had connected the Flevo Lacus (Zuyder-Zee) with the Rhine by means of a canal (in making which he probably made use of the bed of the Yssel), we find mention of three mouths of the Rhine. Of these the names, as given by Pliny , are: on the west, Helium (the Vahalis of other writers); in the centre, Rhenus; and on the east, Flevum; but at a later time we again find mention of only two mouths. The Rhine is described by the ancients as a broad, rapid, and deep river. It receives many tributaries, of which the most important are the Mosella (Moselle) and Mosa (Maas or Meuse) on the left, and the Nicer (Neckar), Moenus (Main), and Luppia (Lippe) on the right. Its whole course amounts to about 950 miles. The inundations of the Rhine near its mouth are mentioned by the ancients. Caesar was the first Roman general who crossed the Rhine. He threw a bridge of boats across the river, probably in the neighbourhood of Cologne. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspons">Pons</ref>.)

<head orig="Rhetorĭca">Rhetorica</head>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. Among the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">ῥητορική</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>) comprised the practical as well as the theoretical art of speaking, and <seg lang="la">rhetor</seg> denoted an orator no less than a teacher of oratory. Among the Romans it denoted only the latter, the actual speaker being called <seg lang="la">orator.</seg> The first men who reduced oratory to a system capable of being taught appeared among the Sicilian Greeks, who, according to the testimony of the ancients, were distinguished for the keenness of their understanding and their love of disputation ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>46</bibl>). The Syracusan Corax (circ. B.C. 500) is said to have been the first who elaborated systematic rules for forensic speeches, and laid them down in writing in a manual on the art of rhetoric (<foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>). His pupil Tisias (born circ. 480), and after him the Leontine Gorgias, further cultivated the art, and from about 427 carried it to Greeee itself, and in particular to Athens, whither he went to ask for an alliance against Syracuse. So far as existing evidence shows, his rhetorical rules were of a highly artificial character, involving the use of studied antitheses and a multitude of tropes. He may, in fact, be regarded as the founder of the so-called Asiatic style of eloquence. In the judicial proceedings and the assemblies of the people the practice of oratory had long been familiar at Athens, though it had not been reduced to technical rules, and oratory had had a conspicuous representative in Pericles. At Athens the theory of oratory was further cultivated by the Sophists (<foreign lang="greek">σοφισταί</foreign>, “men who professed knowledge or wisdom”). Their instruction in style and rhetoric was enjoyed by numerous Athenians, who desired, by the aid of study and practice, to attain to expertness in speaking. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssophistae">Sophistae</ref>.</p>
 <p>The first Athenian who, besides imparting instruction in the new art, applied it practically to speaking in the assemblies of the people and before courts, and who published speeches as patterns for study, was Antiphon (died B.C. 411), the earliest of the so-called Ten Attic Orators. In his extant speeches the oratorical art is shown still in its beginnings. These, with the speeches interwoven in the historical work of his great pupil Thucydides, give an idea of the crude and harsh style of the technical oratory of the time; while the speeches of Andocides (who died about 399), the second of the Ten Orators, display a style that is still uninfluenced by the rhetorical teaching of the age. The first really classical orator is Lysias (died about 360), who, while in possession of all the technical rules of the time, handles with perfect mastery the common language of every-day life. Isocrates (436-338) is reckoned as the father of artistic oratory properly so called; he is a master in the careful choice of words, in the rounding off and rhythmical formation of periods, in the apt employment of figures of speech, and in everything which lends charm to language. By his mastery of style he has exercised the most far-reaching influence upon the oratorical diction of all succeeding time. Of the three kinds of speeches which were distinguished by the ancients —<hi rend="SmallCaps">political</hi> (or <hi rend="SmallCaps">deliberative), forensic</hi>, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">show-speeches</hi> (or <hi rend="SmallCaps">declamations</hi>) —he specially cultivated the last. Among his numerous pupils 
<pb n="1373" /><cb />
 is Isaeus (about 400-350), who, in his general method of oratory, closely follows Lysias, though he shows a more matured skill in the controversial use of oratorical resources. The highest point was attained by his pupil <ref type="cross" target="crossdemosthenes">Demosthenes</ref> (q.v.), the greatest orator of antiquity (384-322); next to him comes his political opponent Aeschines (389- 314). The number of the Ten Orators is completed by their contemporaries Hyperides, Lycurgus, and Dinarchus. In the last of these the beginning of the decline of oratorical art is already clearly apparent.</p>
 <p>To the time of Demosthenes belongs the oldest manual of rhetoric which has been preserved to us—that of Anaximenes of Lampsacus. This is founded on the practice of oratory, and, being intended for immediate practical use, shows no trace of any philosophical groundwork or philosophical research. It is edited by Spengel <bibl default="NO">(Zürich, 1844)</bibl>. Greek rhetoric owes to Aristotle its proper reduction into a scientific system. In contrast to Isocrates, who aims at perfection of form and style, Aristotle, in his <title>Rhetoric</title>, lays special stress on subject-matter, and mainly devotes himself to setting forth the means of producing conviction. In fact, Aristotle regards rhetoric as the counterpart of logic and closely allied with it. See the fine introduction and analysis by Cope in Cope and Sandys' edition of the treatise <bibl default="NO">(3 vols. 1877)</bibl>. When Athens had lost her liberty, practical oratory was more and more reduced to silence; the productions of the last orators, such as Demetrius of Phalerum, were only a feeble echo of the past. Demetrius is said to have been the first to give to oratorical expression a tendency towards an elegant luxuriance. He was also the first to introduce the custom of making speeches upon imaginary subjects by way of practice for deliberative and forensic speaking.</p>
 <p>In later times the home of oratory was transferred to the free Hellenic or hellenized communities of the coasts and islands of Asia Minor, especially Rhodes. On the soil of Asia a new style was developed, called the Asiatic. Its Asiatic originator is said to have been Hegesias of Magnesia near Mount Sipylus. He flourished in the latter half of the third century. In avowed opposition to the method of Demosthenes, who spoke in artistically formed periods, Hegesias not only went back to the simpler constructions of Lysias, but even endeavoured to outvie the latter in simplicity, breaking up all that he had to say into short sentences, and carefully avoiding periods of any length ( <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 226" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Orat.</title>226</bibl>). On the other hand, he sought to give a certain vividness to his speeches by an elaborately arranged order of words and by a far-fetched and often turgid phraseology. This was the prevailing fashion until the middle of the first century B.C. Even in Rome it had numerous followers, especially Hortensius, until by the influence of Cicero it was so utterly crushed out that Hegesias was soon forgotten, even among the Greeks. A peculiar kind of oratory (the so-called Rhodian) prevailed in Rhodes, where a closer approach was again made to the Attic models, and particularly to the representatives of the simple style, such as Hyperides. Conspicuous orators of this school were Apollonius and Molon, both of Alabanda in Caria, in the first half of the first century B.C. These two orators are expressly distinguished from one another by Strabo, p. 655; but they are confounded even by Quintilian, who erroneously speaks of Apollonius Molon (iii. 1, 16; xii. 6, 7). <cb /></p>
 <p>The theory of oratory remained until about the end of the second century B.C. exclusively in the hands of the philosophers, and was little regarded by the Asiatic orators. After that time the orators and practical teachers of the art again applied themselves with eagerness to theoretical studies; the theorists adopted an eclectical method, seeking to combine the philosophical and more scientific proceeding of Aristotle with that of Isocrates, which addressed itself rather to the turns of phrase and the outward forms of oratory. The most noteworthy system was introduced by Hermagoras of Temnos (about B.C. 120), whose writings, which are no longer extant, supplied the chief foundation for the theoretical studies of the Romans at the beginning of the first century B.C. The system of rhetoric elaborated by him was afterwards further worked out and improved in detail. In the time of the Empire the rhetorical schools in general flourished, and we possess an extensive rhetorical literature of that age reaching as far as the fifth century A.D. It includes the works of authors who mainly treated of the literary and aesthetic side of rhetoric, especially those of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the champion of Atticism and of refined taste, and the unknown author of the able treatise, <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὕψους</foreign> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslonginus">Longinus</ref>); also those of technical writers, such as Hermogenes, the most noteworthy representative of the scholastic rhetoric of the age, Apsines, Menander, Theon , Aphthonius, and others. On the revival of Greek oratory after the end of the first century, and particularly in the second century, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssophistae">Sophistae</ref>, and the works mentioned at the end of this article.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>. As among the Athenians, so also among the Romans, the institutions of the State early gave occasion for the practice of political and forensic oratory. Until the end of the third century B.C. this oratory was wholly spontaneous. The speech of the aged Appius Claudius Caecus, delivered in 280 against the peace with Pyrrhus, and afterwards published, was long preserved as the earliest written monument of Roman oratory. Numerous political speeches were published by the well-known Marcus Porcius Cato, the most noteworthy orator during the first half of the second century. After the Second Punic War, in spite of all the opposition of Cato and of those who thought with him, Greek culture forced its way irresistibly into Rome, and the Romans became eager to conform to the Greek theory of oratory also. Servius Sulpicius Galba (circ. B.C. 144) is spoken of as the first man who composed his speeches in accordance with the rules of Greek art, and not long afterwards the younger Gracchus, who died in 121, proved himself a consummate orator through the combination of natural gifts and art. Even at this time the publication of orations after delivery was a general custom, and men were already to be met with who actually wrote speeches for others. At the beginning of the first century B.C. the most noteworthy orators were Marcus Antonius and Lucius Licinius Crassus.</p>
 <p>Rhetorical instruction was originally imparted by Greeks. In the first decade of the first century the freedman Plotius Gallus came forward as a teacher of rhetoric, and other Latin teachers followed him. These found a large number of hearers, 
<pb n="1374" /><cb /> but the censors interfered to stop the practice, as an innovation on the custom of their forefathers. It is true that this attempt to oppose the current, which had already set in, was in vain. Still it was only by freedmen that rhetorical instruction in Latin was given until the time of Augustus, when the Roman knight Blandus was the first free-born man who came forward as a public teacher of rhetoric. Even the Latin rhetoricians derived their theory exclusively from Greek sources, especially from Hermagoras, to whose influence the two earliest extant rhetorical writings of the Roman school are to be referred; these are the work of the pseudo-Cornificius, and the production of Cicero, <title>De Inventione.</title> <ref type="cross" target="crosscicero">Cicero</ref> (q.v.), the greatest orator of Rome and the only orator of the Republic of whom any complete speeches are extant, composed in his later years several other valuable writings upon rhetorical subjects, founded on his practice as an orator— viz. the <title>De Oratore</title>, the <title>Brutus</title>, and the <title>Orator.</title> Besides Cicero, the last age of the Republic possessed a series of other conspicuous orators, such as <ref type="cross" target="crosshortensius">Hortensius</ref> (q.v.), Caelius, Brutus, and, above all, Caesar. A few more representatives of the oratory of the Republic survived to the time of Augustus. The most important of these is Asinius Pollio. But, with the old constitution, the occasions and materials for oratory also disappeared under the Monarchy, and the hindrances and limitations to its public exercise increased in the same proportion. Practice was gradually superseded by theory, orators by rhetoricians, speeches by declamations. The exercises of the rhetorical schools, which now became one of the chief centres of intellectual life, paid almost exclusive attention to the form, and dealt with imaginary subjects of political and forensic oratory, called <seg lang="la">suasoriae</seg> and <seg lang="la">controversiae</seg>, which were as far as possible removed from the practice of life. A vivid picture of these exercises is preserved in the reminiscences of the rhetorician Seneca, the father of the well-known philosopher. The manner of speaking contracted in the schools was adopted on the few occasions on which practical oratory could still be exercised, and these occasions were accordingly turned into exhibitions of theatrical declamation. It was in vain that men like Quintilian, in his work on the training of an orator (<title>Institutio Oratoria</title>), and Tacitus, in his <title>Dialogus</title>, pointed to the true classical patterns, and combated the fashion of their time, from which even they were not entirely free. Like these, the younger Pliny belongs to the end of the first century <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.d.;</hi> his <title>Panegyricus</title>, addressed to Trajan, the only monument of Roman oratory after Cicero preserved in a complete form, became the model for the later panegyrists. In the second century A.D. Fronto, and the school named after him, sought to revive the old Roman spirit by a tasteless imitation of archaic expressions and forms of speech. The same style is practised, though with more ability, by the African Apuleius. After the end of the third century the oratorical art had its chief seat in the towns of Gaul, especially in Trèves (Treviri) and Bordeaux (Burdigala). Here a style of oratory was matured which possessed a certain smoothness and copiousness in words, but showed great lack of ideas. Upon the representatives of this style, the “Panegyrists,” see <ref type="cross" target="crosspanegyricus">Panegyricus</ref>. <cb /></p>

She afterwards became the property of Xanthus, another Samian, who carried her to Naucratis in Egypt, in the reign of Amasis, and at this great seaport she carried on the trade of an hetaera for the benefit of her master. While thus employed, Charaxus, the brother of the poetess Sappho, who had come to Naucratis as a merchant, fell in love with her, and ransomed her from slavery for a large sum of money. She was in consequence attacked by Sappho in a poem. She continued to live at Naucratis, and with the tenth part of her gains she dedicated at Delphi ten iron spits, which were seen by Herodotus. She is called Rhodopis by Herodotus, but Sappho in her poem spoke of her under the name of Doricha.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ῥόδος</foreign>). Now Rhodos, Rhodes; the most easterly island of the Aegaean, or, more specifically, of the Carpathian Sea, lying off the southern coast of Caria, due south of the promontory of Cynossema (Cape Aloupo), at the distance of about twelve geographical miles. Its length, from northeast to southwest, is about forty-five miles; its greatest breadth about twenty to twenty-five. In early times it was called Aethraea and Ophiussa, and several other names. There are various mythological stories about its origin and peopling. Its Hellenic colonization is ascribed to Tlepolemus, the son of Heracles, before the Trojan War, and after that war to Althaemenes. Homer mentions the three Dorian settlements in Rhodes—namely, Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus; and these cities, with Cos, Cnidus, and Halicarnassus, formed the Dorian Hexapolis, which was established, from a period of unknown antiquity, in the southwest corner of Asia Minor. Rhodes soon became a great maritime State, or rather confederacy, the island being parcelled out between the three cities above mentioned. The Rhodians made distant voyages and founded numerous colonies. <figure id="fig.01375">

 <p>At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, Rhodes was one of those Dorian maritime States which were subject to Athens; but in the twentieth year of the war, B.C. 412, it joined the Spartan alliance, and the oligarchical party, which had been depressed, and their leaders, the Eratidae, expelled, recovered their former power under Dorieus. In 408 the new capital, called <ref type="cross" target="crossrhodus">Rhodus</ref>, was built, and peopled from the three ancient cities of Ialysus, Lindus, and Camirus. At the Macedonian conquest the Rhodians submitted to Alexander, but upon his death expelled the Macedonian garrison. In the ensuing wars they formed an alliance with Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, and their city, Rhodes, successfully endured a most famous siege by the forces of Demetrius Poliorcetes, who at length, in admiration of the valour of the besieged, presented them with the engines he had used against the city, from the sale of which they defrayed the cost of the celebrated <ref type="cross" target="crosscolossus">Colossus</ref> (q.v.). At length they came into connection with the Romans, whose alliance they joined, with Attalus, king of Pergamus, in the war against Philip III. of Macedon. In the ensuing war with Antiochus the Rhodians gave the Romans great aid with their fleet; and in the subsequent partition of the Syrian possessions of Asia Minor, 
<pb n="1376" /><cb />
 they were rewarded by the supremacy of Southern Caria, where they had had settlements from an early period. A temporary interruption of their alliance with Rome was caused by their espousing the cause of Perseus, for which they were severely punished (B.C. 168); but they recovered the favour of Rome by the important naval aid they rendered in the Mithridatic War. In the Civil Wars they took part with Caesar, and suffered in consequence from Cassius (42), but were afterwards compensated for their losses by the favour of Antonius. They were at length deprived of their independence by Claudius; and their prosperity received its final blow from an earthquake, which laid the city of Rhodes in ruins, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, A.D. 155.

<head orig="Rhotacism">Rhotacism</head>

 <p> A technical term of scientific grammar, applied to the change of a voiced <hi rend="italic">s (z)</hi> to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> between two vowels. In Greek this change is rare, as in that language the intervocalic <hi rend="italic">s</hi> regularly passed into <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and then disappeared, leaving no trace of its existence, while in Latin it is regularly changed to <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> (Cf. the Gk. <foreign lang="greek">μῦς, μυ-ός</foreign>, Lat. <seg lang="la">mus, mu-r-is:</seg> Gk. <foreign lang="greek">νυός</foreign>, Lat. <hi rend="italic">nu-r-us.</hi>) In the dialect of Greek spoken in Elis, rhotacism occurred instead of loss of <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and so in some late Laconian words influenced by the usage of the neighbouring Elis. In Latin rhotacism is a regular law, for though there are many apparent exceptions to it, examination shows that in most of these cases the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> was not originally intervocalic or else that the word is of (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) foreign or (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) late origin. For instance, in <seg lang="la">causa</seg> the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is not changed to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> because it represents probably <hi rend="italic">ss</hi>, Cicero having written it <seg lang="la">caussa.</seg> In many compounds <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is not changed to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> because <cb /> it is to be regarded as an initial rather than as an intervocalic consonant—e. g. <seg lang="la">desilio, positura.</seg> In many other words the apparently intervocalic <hi rend="italic">s</hi> represents a substitution for another original letter—e. g. <seg lang="la">esuries</seg> (√<hi rend="italic">ed</hi> of <seg lang="la">edo), prosa (provorsa), rosa</seg> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">ῥόδον</foreign>), <seg lang="la">casa</seg> (√<hi rend="italic">skad</hi>, hence <hi rend="italic">cadta</hi>). Such words as <seg lang="la">basium, casium, gaesum, siser</seg>, and probably <seg lang="la">asinus</seg> are non-Latin in their origin. The real exceptions to the operation of the regular change to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> do not amount to more than a half dozen, such as <seg lang="la">vasa, nasus, agaso, caseus;</seg> and the exceptions are the basis of a special law known as <hi rend="SmallCaps">Conway's Law</hi>, first set forth by Mr. R. S. Conway, in 1887, as a sort of corollary to Verner's Law. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossverners-law">Verner's Law</ref>.) Conway's Law is as follows: Medial <hi rend="italic">s</hi> between words after an unaccented syllable became <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but after an accented syllable it was retained except when followed by <seg lang="la">i</seg> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and preceded by <seg lang="la">i</seg> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi> or a long vowel or diphthong; while medial <hi rend="italic">s</hi> before nasals after an unaccented syllable was lost without compensation; after an accented syllable if arising before the period of rhotacism it was lost with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel (e. g. <seg lang="la">aenus, primus</seg>); if arising during the period of rhotacism it became <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (e. g. <seg lang="la">carmen, verna</seg>).</p>
 <p>Rhotacism in Latin is said to have been effected in the fourth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c.</hi>, as Cicero says (<title>Ad Fam.</title> ix. 21) that L. Papirius, who was consul in B.C. 336, was the first of his family to give up the older spelling Papisius. But the change in general was probably effected earlier, for proper names are notoriously the last to suffer alterations of form.</p>
 <p>Rhotacism occurs also in the Teutonic branches of the Indo-Germanic group of languages. (Cf. Germ. <hi rend="italic">eisen</hi>, Engl. <hi rend="italic">iron;</hi> <hi rend="italic">Germ. blasen</hi>, Engl. <hi rend="italic">blare;</hi> Engl. sing. <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, plur. <hi rend="italic">were.</hi>) The unvoiced <hi rend="italic">s</hi> first passes into the voiced <hi rend="italic">s (z)</hi> and thence to lingual <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, for the position of the vocal organs in pronouncing <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is substantially the same as that required for <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>

<head orig="Rhyme">Rhyme</head>

 <p> The recurrence of similar sounds at the end of successive lines of verse was not formally recognized by the Greeks and Romans of classical times as a legitimate feature of poetical composition; and having a definite metrical system based upon the laws of syllabic quantity, the need was not especially felt of the added pleasure which the ear receives from rhyme. Nevertheless, rhyme is found in both Greek and Latin verse— in Greek probably as a sort of accident of composition which did, however, heighten the enjoyment of the listener, and in Latin sometimes as a consciously sought device. The two languages, therefore, stand on a different footing in this respect. (See Jahn's <title>Jahrbuch</title> for 1830, p. 256; Casaubon, <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <bibl n="Pers.  1. 93" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.i. 93</bibl><bibl n="Pers.  94." default="NO" valid="yes">Pers., 94.</bibl>) When the rhyme occurs in Homer, as in the following ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 225" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 225</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 226" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 226</bibl>), <lb /><foreign lang="greek">Ἀτρείδην προσέειπε καὶ οὔπω λη_γε χόλοιο</foreign> <lb /><foreign lang="greek">Οἰνοβαρὲς, κυνὸς ὄμματ ἔχων, κραδίην δ ἐλάφοιο</foreign>, 
<pb n="1377" /><cb /> it has no especial significance, and simply occurs with probably no design on the poet's part. In Latin the function of rhyme is more important. The early (native) verse being accented like our own and rough in its structure, did undoubtedly introduce the element of rhyme to please the ear, so that when Ennius transplanted the metrical system of the Greeks and forced the Latin language to conform to its general requirements, he still retained some of the native peculiarities in his lines—especially alliteration and rhyme. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalliteration">Alliteration</ref>.) The following is a striking example of the conscious use of the latter: <lb />Haec omnia vidi inflammari, <lb />Priamo vi vitam evitari, <lb />Iovis aram sanguine turpari.</p>
 <p>And so in another of the older poets quoted by Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 1. 28" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tusc.</title>i. 28</bibl>): <lb />Caelum nitescere, arbores frondescere, <lb />Vites laetificae pampinis pubescere, <lb />Rami bacarum ubertate incurvescere.</p>
 <p>As the system based on quantity became more and more definitely established, however, rhyme occurs less frequently, until in Vergil it appears to be almost studiously avoided except in rare instances where it heightens the effect by giving a sonorous swell to an impressive utterance, as is the case in the following ( <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 4. 50" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>iv. 50</bibl>-51): <lb />Aspice convexo nutantem pondere mundum <lb />Terrasque tractusque maris caelique profundum!</p>

 <p>Ovid, partly because of his indolence and partly because his less severe taste probably enjoyed the richness of the melodic effect, uses rhyme with much greater frequency than Vergil; and he also admits the so-called Leonine rhyme, as in the following: <lb />Quem mare carpentem, substrictaque crura gerentem,</p>
 <p>and <lb />Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas,</p>
 <p>and in the pentameter intentionally frequent: <lb />Quaerebant flavos per nemus omne favos.</p>
 <p>These Leonine rhymes became more and more frequent in the Silver Age of the language, and render easy the transitional reversion from the classic system to the popular one, as men's knowledge of the laws of quantity grew uncertain owing to the influx of foreign writers and a less careful training in the schools. See <ref type="cross" target="crossleonini-versus">Leonini Versus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Ovid often uses the rhyme to point a climax precisely as Shakspeare does in many of the soliloquies and studied declamatory passages of his plays—e. g. at the end of Macbeth's famous soliloquy: <lb />Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell <lb />That summons thee to heaven or to hell!</p>
 <p>and in the spirited address of Henry V. to his troops: <lb />Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance! <lb />No king in England if not king in France!</p>
 <p>The summing up of the whole matter is briefly as follows: rhyme was a subordinate element in the early popular poetry; it was suppressed during the Golden Age of literature, but as learning waned it again came to the front and resumed its place in the compositions of poets, so that in the Christian hymns it has practically supplanted the quantitative system, and appears as fully as in modern poetry. <cb /></p>
 <p>The toleration and even fondness of the Romans for assonances may be seen even in their prose, as when they bring together such similar words— e. g. <seg lang="la">florem et colorem</seg> ( <bibl n="Cic.

 <p> The Roman “King-maker,” was the son of a Suevian chief, and was brought up at the court of Valentinian III. He served with distinction under Aëtius, in the reign of Valentinian III. In A.D. 456 he commanded the fleet of the emperor Avitus, with which he gained a great victory 
<pb n="1378" /><cb /> over the Vandals, and in the same year he deposed Avitus; but as he was a barbarian by birth, he would not assume the title of emperor, but gave it to Majorian, intending to keep the real power in his own hands. But as Majorian proved more able and energetic than Ricimer had expected, he was put to death in 461 by order of Ricimer, who now raised Libius Severus to the throne. On the death of Severus in 465, Ricimer kept the government in his own hands for the next eighteen months; but in 467 Anthemius was appointed emperor of the West by Leo, emperor of the East. Ricimer acquiesced in the appointment, and received the daughter of Anthemius in marriage; but in 472 he made war against his father-in-law, and took Rome by storm. Anthemius perished in the assault, and Olybrius was proclaimed emperor by Ricimer, who died, however, forty days after the sack of Rome ( <bibl n="Procop.

 <p>One of the most eminent classical philologists of modern times, born at Grossvargula, in Thuringia, April 6th, 1806. He studied at Leipzig under Hermann, and from 1826 to 1829 at Halle, where he eagerly availed himself of the lectures and society of Reissig. In 1832 he was called to Breslau as Extraordinary Professor, receiving at the same time a joint directorship of the philological seminary. Two years aftewards he became Ordinary Professor, and spent the winter and spring of 1836-37 on a tour through Italy. In 1839 he accepted an invitation to Bonn as Professor of Classical Literature and Rhetoric. The Prussian government conferred on him the rank of Privy-Councillor in 1856. His first literary works were devoted to the Greek grammarians, as the edition of Thomas Magister <bibl default="NO">(Halle, 1832)</bibl>, the acute and penetrating treatise <bibl default="NO"><title>De Oro et Orione</title> (Breslau, 1834)</bibl>, and the richly elucidatory <bibl default="NO"><title>Die alexandrin. Bibliotheken und die Sammlung der Homerischen Gedichte durch Peisistratus</title> (Breslau, 1838)</bibl>, sufficiently prove; but his greatest work is his edition of Plautus <bibl default="NO">(Bonn, 1848-53)</bibl>, executed with the richest critical apparatus, and accompanied by comprehensive prolegomena on the Plautine metres. This work secured for him a splendid reputation among his countrymen. Among the numerous productions of Ritschl which may be regarded as preparatory to this <hi rend="italic">chef-d'oeuvre</hi>, the most important is his <bibl default="NO"><title>Parerga Plautina et Terentiana</title> (Leipzig, 1848)</bibl>. Subsequently his literary activity took another direction—a systematic treatment of Latin inscriptions, with the view of illustrating the history of the Latin language. His labours in this department were crowned with success, for Ritschl has thrown more light upon the successive phases of the language than almost any other single individual. To this field belong his <bibl default="NO"><title>Lex Rubria</title> (Bonn, 1851)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Titulus Mummianus</title> (Berlin, 1852)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Monumenta Epigraphica Tria</title> (Berlin, 1852)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Inscriptio Columnae Rostratae</title> (Berlin, 1852)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Anthologiae Latinae Corollarium</title> (Berlin, 1853)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>De Sepulcro Furiorum</title> (Berlin, 1853)</bibl>; <title>De Fictilibus Litteratis</title>, etc. <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1853)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Poesis Saturninae Spicelegium</title> (Bonn, 1854)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>De Titulo Metrico Lambacsensi</title> (1855)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>De Varronis Hebdomadum Libris</title> (1856)</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>In Leges Viselliam, Antoniam, Corneliam Observationes Epigraphicae</title> (1860)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO"><title>Prooemiorum Bonnensium Decas</title> (1862)</bibl>.

<head orig="Roma">Roma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ῥώμη</foreign>). Rome. Rome lies on the river Tiber, about fourteen miles, in a straight line, from the sea. Its latitude (41° 53' N.) is the same as that of Chicago; its longitude (12° 29' E.) corresponds very nearly with that of Venice and of Leipzig. Its site forms a part of the gently rolling volcanic plain which lies between the sea and the Sabine and Alban Mountains, extending from Cape Linaro, on the north, as far south as Astura and the Pontine Marshes. The earlier city was confined to the left bank of the river, which here pursues a very winding course and, dividing, surrounds a small, flat island; but before the end of the Republic a considerable suburb had sprung up on the right bank, which became the fourteenth Regio in the division of the city under Augustus.</p>
 <p>The oft-mentioned hills of Rome are low, and now, with some exceptions, of gentle slope. In ancient times they were more steep; for the intervening depressions (and to a less extent the lower parts of the hills themselves) have been covered, to the depth of nine, twelve, and in places even thirty feet, by the accumulation of débris. They are partly spurs, or irregular projections, from the line of bluffs which marks the descent from the general altitude of the Campagna into the valley of the Tiber, partly isolated masses nearer the river-bed. To the former class belong the Quirinal and Viminal hills, whose highest elevation above the surface of the Tiber (this being reckoned at 21.98 feet above sea-level) is about 158 feet; the Esquiline, with its two spurs Cispius (151 feet) and Oppius (161 feet); and the Caelian (141 feet), which is separated from both the Esquiline and the Aventine by valleys. The hills standing by themselves are the Capitoline (the two summits 141 feet, the depression between them 98 feet above the Tiber), which was originally connected with the Quirinal by a ridge; the Palatine (141 feet); and the Aventine (128 feet). To the north of the Quirinal, but not counted as one of the Seven Hills, was the Collis Hortorum, now the Pincio (164 feet). The small elevation southwest of the Aventine (Mons Testaceus, now Monte Testaccio, 115 feet) is entirely artificial, being composed chiefly of fragments of pottery. Along the right bank stretched the high ridge of the Ianiculum (253 feet), with its continuation, Mons Vaticanus.</p>
 <p>Between the Quirinal and the Tiber was the level Campus Martius, at first a training-field outside the walls, in later times built upon and included within the city limits. The cattle-mart 
<pb n="1379" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01379">
<head orig="Plan of Rome.">Plan of Rome.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>(Forum Boarium) lay between the Palatine and the Tiber, the Circus Maximus between the Palatine and the Aventine. On the low ground north of the Palatine, stretching towards the Capitoline, was the Forum (often called Forum Romanum, or Forum Magnum, to distinguish it from the imperial forums), the spot in which the life of Rome centred; as it became too small for the congestion of business, relief was sought by building a series of extensions (Fora Caesarum) on the north side. The Colosseum (Amphitheatrum Flavium), the greatest monument of Roman architecture, stands in the depression between the Palatine, Esquiline, and Caelian Hills. See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>In its development as a city Rome passed through several stages, some of which are clearly defined. Numerous indications point to the Palatine Hill as the seat of earliest settlement. At a remote period it was fortified by a strong wall of well-squared tufa blocks, laid without mortar; fragments of this wall have been discovered on the south and west sides. At least three gates gave access to the hill-top thus enclosed: the Porta Mugonia (<title>vetus porta Palatii</title>, cf. fig. 7) on the north side, the River-gate (Porta Romanula) on the west side, and a third, of which the name is uncertain, on the south side. To the latest times the Romans regarded the Palatine with especial reverence, and there cherished certain memorials associated with their oldest legends, such as the Hut of Romulus (Casa Romuli), which, though no doubt built of wood, and straw-thatched, <cb /> was kept in repair, and was still standing in the fourth century A.D. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">Domus</ref>, p. 536.</p>
 <p>How long the Palatine city sufficed for the needs of the population cannot even be conjectured. After a time the limits seem to have been extended so as to include the Cispius, the Oppius, and the depression between them (Fagutal), together with the valley lying between these and the Palatine (Subura), as well as the small spur which the Palatine throws out towards the northeast (Velia), and a portion of its slope on the northwest side (Cermalus). To the city thus formed of seven parts (the original Palatine city being counted as one) the name Septimontium appears to have been given; but evidence regarding it is both meagre and unsatisfactory. More is known about the boundaries of Rome in the next stage of development, when enlarged by the addition of the Quirinal, Viminal, and Caelian Hills. It was now divided into four wards (<seg lang="la">regiones;</seg> cf. Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 45), the first (Regio Suburana) comprising the Caelian Hill and the Subura; the second (Esquilina), the Cispius, Oppius, and Fagutal; the third (Collina), the Quirinal and Viminal Hills; the fourth (Palatina) included the Palatine, Cermalus, and Velia. The Capitoline Hill was made a part of the city, but not set off as a separate ward; it was retained as a common sanctuary and fortress. Of the fortifications, by which this city of the four wards must have been protected, no trace has yet been found.</p>
 <p>The bounds of Rome in the period with which the name of Servius Tullius is connected can be 
<pb n="1380" /><cb />
 made out, for a large portion of the circuit, with exactness; for they were unchanged during the whole time of the Republic, and were marked by a line of imposing fortifications (<title>agger Servii Tullii</title>), remains of which have been discovered at many points. The Aventine Hill was now included within the limits, which were extended also further to the east on the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline Hills. The wall of Servius was pierced by a number of gates, of which those most frequently mentioned are the Porta Carmentalis, at the foot of the Capitoline; the Porta Collina and Porta Esquilina, on the east side; and especially the Porta Capena, which opened into the Appian Way. The area bounded by the wall was about two square miles.</p>
 <p>By the time of Augustus, Rome had extended beyond the Servian wall on every side. In B.C. 8 he divided the whole city, including the parts beyond the Servian limits, into fourteen wards (indicated on the Plan by Roman numerals). In each ward was afterwards placed a watch-house (<seg lang="la">excubitorium</seg>) for the <seg lang="la">vigiles</seg>, of whom there were seven cohorts (=about 7000 men), so distributed that each cohort looked after two wards; the duties of the <seg lang="la">vigiles</seg> were those of our policemen and firemen combined. The wards were subdivided into precincts (<seg lang="la">vici;</seg> the <seg lang="la">vicus</seg> as a subdivision is much older than the time of Augustus), each comprising a group, or block, of buildings; over the precincts were the precinct-masters (<seg lang="la">magistri vicorum</seg>), whose duties included not only the general oversight of other matters, but especially provision for the worship of the Lares Compitales (q. v.), to which the worship of the Genius of Augustus was added.</p>
 <p>This larger Rome was finally fortified by a massive wall, commenced by Aurelian in A.D. 271, but not finished till the reign of Probus (A.D. 276-282). The Aurelian wall, as it is generally called (on the Plan, <title>Murus Aureliani et Probi</title>), was about 54 feet high on the outside, faced with brick, and strengthened (at any rate after the first restoration) by 381 square towers. It was repaired by Arcadius and Honorius in A.D. 403, afterwards by other rulers, and by several Popes; the greater part is still standing. It was constructed in great haste, as is shown by the large use of materials taken from other structures, and by the fact that walls previously erected for different purposes (e. g. see Plan, <title>Castra Praetoria</title> and <title>Amphitheatrum Castrense</title>), whose aggregate length amounted to about one sixth of the entire circuit, were incorporated in it as they stood. There were originally fourteen gates, vaulted, and flanked with round towers, besides the posterns, or small passages used for purposes of traffic in time of peace; the number was raised to fifteen by the enlargement of the Porta Pinciana from a postern to a gate of full size, probably by Honorius (<title>Bull. Com. Arch.</title> 1892, p. 102). The whole length of the wall was 11.7 miles (18837.50 m.); the area enclosed by it was 5.019 square miles, less than one-eighth the area of New York City.</p>
 <p>The religious boundary of Rome, the <ref type="cross" target="crosspomerium">Pomerium</ref> (q.v.), was not moved forward at the same time with the civil and military limits. The Pomerium of the city in the period when it comprised four wards and the Capitoline remained unchanged till the time of Sulla , who caused an extension to be made, but for some reason did not include the Aventine; this was outside the Pomerium till the <cb /> reign of Claudius. Only he who had extended the territorial limits of Rome was entitled to the distinction of enlarging the Pomerium. After Sulla, at least Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, and Titus availed themselves of the privilege; and the line of Aurelian's wall for considerable distances seems to have coincided with a Pomerium previously fixed, perhaps also with an earlier limit of taxation for provisions brought into the city.</p>
 <p>The population of Rome in the different periods cannot be estimated, even approximately; but, to judge from the area within the Aurelian wall, it can hardly at any time have exceeded 1,800,000.</p>
 <p>The Tiber within the Aurelian wall was spanned by several bridges. The earliest was the Pons Sublicius, which was constructed of wood so that it could be cut down easily on the approach of an enemy; it was kept in repair, on religious grounds, even after bridges of stone stood above and below it. Next came the bridges connecting the island with the two banks, Pons Fabricius and Pons Cestius, both originally of wood, but renewed in stone in the first century B.C. The first stone bridge was the Pons Aemilius, also called Lapideus, dating from B.C. 142. The others were Pons Agrippae (reign of Augustus), Pons Aurelius (probably dating from the reign of Caracalla), and Pons Probi (reign of Probus). Frequently reckoned with these are two bridges outside the walls—the famous Mulvian Bridge (Pons Mulvius or Milvius, B.C. 109), two miles north on the Via Flaminia; and the Pons Aelius by the Campus Martius, built by Hadrian. Nero's bridge (Pons Neronis) was broken down, perhaps as early as the time of Hadrian. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspons">Pons</ref>.</p>
 <p>Along the Tiber were wharfs. The river-bed was skilfully adjusted—far more skilfully than under the system adopted some years ago and put into effect at enormous expense by the Italian engineers—to the great variation in the volume of water carried down, which at flood-height has been known to measure fourteen times the amount flowing when the river is at its ordinary level. The channel was graded at three elevations, so as to make three stages. Thus at the Pons Aelius the bottom division, for low water, was 218.2 feet wide; the middle division, for ordinary height, 319.9 feet wide; while to the upper division, designed to carry off the water in time of flood, a width of 442.9 feet was given (<title>Bull. Com. Arch.</title> 1893, p. 15). A complicated system of drains led into the Tiber through several large main sewers. Of the latter the Cloaca Maxima is justly celebrated as one of the best examples of early hydraulic construction. According to tradition it was built in the time of the Tarquins. Starting in the Subura, it followed a very irregular course, which was perhaps determined by the channel of a primitive brook (<title>Mitth.</title> 1891, p. 86). It passed beneath the Forum at the lowest point, under the east end of the Basilica Iulia, and emptied into the Tiber by the Forum Boarium. The channel of the Cloaca Maxima was paved with polygonal blocks of lava, and vaulted with large voussoirs of a hard kind of tufa (<title>lapis Gabinus</title>) laid without mortar; to give greater solidity at the mouth, the vaulting there for some distance was composed of voussoirs of peperino (<title>lapis Albanus</title>) arranged in three rings. The dimensions of the channel vary; where it is largest, at the opening into the Tiber, it is 14.75 feet wide and 18.96 feet high, measured from the 
<pb n="1381" /><cb />
 pavement to the middle of the vault (<title>Ant. Demkm.</title> 1889, Taf. 37). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>.</p>
 <p>The architecture of Rome in the early days was unpretentious. Even the temples, built after Etruscan patterns, were low and of common materials covered with stucco. The streets were narrow and crooked; as a large amount of wood was used in construction, it is not surprising that between the years B.C. 215 and 50 seven terrible conflagrations swept over the parts of the city along the Tiber and about the Forum; inundations of the river also at times caused great destruction. Not till near the end of the Republic did ambitious citizens direct their energies towards the erection of fine public buildings, such as Pompey's theatre; some, in the same period, as Lucullus and Aemilius Scaurus, lavished money upon palatial residences, which they ornamented with costly marbles. Cicero, patriot that he was, found Rome inferior to Capua not only in general appearance, but particularly in the matter of streets, and he speaks contemptuously of the building materials—<seg lang="la">in latere aut in caemento, ex quibus urbs effecta est </seg>( II. xlvii. 99; <title>Leg. Agr.</title> II. xxxv. 96). He himself had a house on the north slope of the Palatine which cost him 3,500,000 sesterces (about $144,000); the house of Aemilius Scaurus is said to have been sold to the infamous Clodius for the enormous sum of nearly 15,000,000 sesterces (about $615,000).</p>
 <p>Iulius Caesar formed large plans for the beautifying of Rome, but in the midst of their accomplishment his life was cut short. Augustus completed the edifices which his adoptive father had left unfinished, and inaugurated a new epoch in the extent to which he carried not only the erection of buildings, but also the restoration of earlier structures (the temples restored by him numbered eighty-two) and the use of fine materials, especially marble and travertine (<title>lapis Tiburtinus</title>); his saying that he “found the city of brick and left it of marble” was no idle boast ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>28</bibl>; cf. Mommsen, <title>Res Gestae Divi Aug.</title> 19-21). His example was followed by other emperors, among whom the greatest builders were Vespasian, Titus, Trajan, and Hadrian; of lower rank than these as regards the architectural style, though not the size, of their buildings (chiefly <title>Thermae</title>), were Caracalla, Diocletian, and Constantine. Roman architecture was at its best in the period from Augustus to Hadrian.</p>
 <p>The contributions of the Romans to the progress of the arts were greater in the field of architecture than in any other. From the time of Sulla they freely adopted the architectural forms of the Greeks; but with these they combined the extensive use of the round arch, and gradually worked out a system which enabled them to erect immense structures, such as lay within the range of neither the Greek nor the Etruscan architecture. Lacking the Greek sensitiveness to perfect proportion, <ref id="n4" target="ref4"></ref> <cb /> they relied, for effect, more upon massiveness than upon symmetry, and indulged in greater richness of decoration than Greek taste would have allowed. Under the Empire they ransacked the known world for the choicest marbles, as well as for the hard stones, the granites, and porphyries; these they turned to account in every conceivable way, larger masses being used for columns and other architectural members, thin slabs for incrustation, and small fragments for mosaics. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmusivum-opus">Musivum Opus</ref>.) Surfaces finished in stucco were decorated in brilliant colours, frequently with complicated designs, sometimes with paintings of high merit (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspictura">Pictura</ref>); bas-reliefs also were painted. In their adaptation of the Greek orders of architecture the Romans made changes affecting alike the shaft, capital, and architrave. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna">Columna</ref>.) Borrowing also from the Greeks the plan of the oblong temple and that of the hill-side theatre, they altered both; at the same time, contrary to Greek practice, they raised their temples upon <figure id="fig.01381">
<head orig="Temple of Vesta. (Restoration.)">Temple of Vesta. (Restoration.)</head>
</figure> high foundations, and gave to their theatres a full elevation on the exterior. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaedes">Aedes</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>.) But apart from these, they so developed several architectural types as to make them distinctively Roman; such were the <ref type="cross" target="crosscircus">circus</ref> (q.v.), the amphitheatre (see <ref type="cross" target="crossamphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</ref>), the <ref type="cross" target="crossbasilica">basilica</ref> (q.v.), baths (see <ref type="cross" target="crossthermae">Thermae</ref>), the triumphal arch (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarcus">Arcus</ref>), the commemorative column (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna-cochlis">Columna Cochlis</ref>), the round tomb (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmausoleum">Mausoleum</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>), and the aqueduct, so far as this was constructed above ground on the principle of the arcade. The Roman roads also, though in the modern view belonging rather to the domain of engineering than to that of architecture, were equally characteristic (see <ref type="cross" target="crossvia">Via</ref>); and certain of their bridges, as that at Alcántara in Spain, command universal admiration. No other city has been able to boast of so great a number and variety of beautiful or impressive structures as Rome in the first half of the fourth century A.D. According 
<pb n="1382" /><cb /> to a Catalogue dating from that period, the city contained 2 circuses, 2 amphitheatres, 3 theatres, 10 basilicas, 11 thermae, 36 arches of marble, 2 commemorative columns, 6 obelisks (imported from Egypt), 423 temples, 1790 <seg lang="la">domus</seg>—that is, extensive private residences, or palaces, of the wealthy—besides which there were reckoned 46,602 tenements (<seg lang="la">insulae</seg>); the open places were adorned with 2 <seg lang="la">colossi</seg> (probably those of Nero and Augustus), 22 “great horses” (presumably counting not merely the large equestrian statues, as that of Marcus Aurelius, now in the square of the Capitol, but also groups of which horses formed a part, as those of the Dioscuri on the Capitoline and the Quirinal), to which are added 80 gilded and 77 ivory statues of the gods, no mention being made of the countless lesser statues on every side.</p>
 <p>The number of obelisks in Rome is known to have been about twice that given in the Catalogue. Of the 19 aqueducts by which, according to the Catalogue, the city was supplied with water, part were branches. The principal aqueducts were: Aqua Appia, built in B.C. 312; Anio Vetus, for the Esquiline Hill, B.C. 272; Aqua Marcia (B.C. 144) and Aqua Tepula (B.C. 125), extending to the Capitoline; three constructed in the reign of Augustus: Aqua Iulia (B.C. 33), in the line of the Marcia and Tepula; Aqua Virgo (B.C. 19), for the Campus Martius; and Aqua Alsietina (B.C. 2), for his <seg lang="la">naumachia</seg> on the right bank of the Tiber; Anio Novus, built by Caligula; Aqua Claudia, by Claudius; Aqua Traiana, by Trajan, the last on the right bank; Aqua Severiana and Aqua Alexandrina, constructed to supply baths, the former by Septimius, the latter by Alexander, Severus. According to Lanciani's calculations, the amount of water brought in daily by the aqueducts in the time of Nerva (before the last three named in the list were built) was about 23,839,793 cu. ft. (cu. m. 675,092; see his <title>I Comentarii di Frontino</title>, p. 362). Three of the aqueducts have been repaired and are in use—the Aqua Marcia, Aqua Virgo, and Aqua Traiana. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaquae-ductus">Aquaeductus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The names and dates of the more noteworthy buildings will now be given in connection with a rapid survey of the City according to its main divisions, commencing with the Capitoline Hill.</p>
 <p>On the northern summit of the Capitoline was the Stronghold (<title>Arx</title>) of the earlier city. Within <figure id="fig.01382">

</figure> <cb /> its walls were the Auguraculum, an open place where auspices were taken; the Temple of Iuno Moneta, with which the Mint was connected; and a Temple of Concord, built in B.C. 217; but their location is uncertain. On the southern summit was the most magnificent of all Roman temples, that of Iupiter Optimus Maximus, called the Capitolium. It stood in an <hi rend="italic">area</hi>, on a high platform, and was nearly square, being Etruscan in plan and style; the sum of the four sides measured perhaps 760 feet. The front part was a triple colonnade; behind this were the three large <seg lang="la">cellae</seg>, the middle one for Iupiter, the other two for Minerva and Iuno. The original edifice is ascribed to the Tarquins, but it was not dedicated till the first year of the Republic, B.C. 509. It became a repository of the richest booty and votive offerings. In B.C. 83 it was burned to the ground; it was rebuilt, with richer adornment, the second temple being dedicated in B.C. 69. Again filled with treasures, it fell a prey to flames in A.D. 69. It was rebuilt a third time on the same plan, but as a Corinthian hexastyle, only to be burned again in A.D. 80. It was restored with great splendour, the fourth temple being dedicated by Domitian in A.D. 82. It was not again destroyed by fire, but remained to be dismantled by plunderers.</p>
 <p>The Capitol was reached from the Forum by a graded road (<title>Clivus Capitolinus</title>, paved in B.C. 174), from which a branch led to the Arx. Of the open places, shrines, and private buildings on the Capitoline outside the Capitol and the Arx very little is known. The Tarpeian Rock was on the southeast side. On the slope of the Capitoline overlooking the Forum was the Tabularium, a depository for archives, erected in B.C. 78.</p>
 <p>The northeast and southwest sides of the Forum in early times were lined with small shops (<seg lang="la">tabernae</seg>), which eventually were removed to make room for public buildings. The very ancient shrine of Ianus stood somewhere near the middle of the northwest side; the round Temple of Vesta at the southeast corner. The Palace of the Vestals (<title>Atrium Vestae</title>), southeast of the temple, was greatly changed by enlargements and restorations; near it was the official residence of the Pontifex Maximus (<title>Regia</title>). In the vaults of the Temple of Saturn (dedicated B.C. 497) the public treasure was kept (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaerarium">Aerarium</ref>); the eight Ionic columns remaining belong to a later restoration. The three beautiful Corinthian columns still standing on the foundation of the Temple of Castor (dedicated B.C. 484) date from a restoration in B.C. 6. The Temple of Concord was likewise of early date (dedicated B.C. 366); but the existing plan and fragments date from a remodelling of the edifice in B.C. 7. Under the Empire temples were erected in honour of Iulius Caesar (<title>Templum Divi Iulii</title>, marking the spot where his body was burned, dedicated B.C. 29); of Vespasian (three Corinthian columns remain); of Faustina, wife of Antoninus Pius, dedicated to him also after his death in A.D. 161 (now the Church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda); and of Romulus, the small son of Maxentius, who died in A.D. 309; this last building, of circular form (now incorporated in the Church of SS. Cosmas and Damian), lies just beyond the Temple of Faustina, northeast of the Forum. In A.D. 367 a series of twelve chapels, containing gilded statues of the Olympian divinities, was erected in the southwest corner (<title>Porticus Deorum Consentium</title>). 
<pb n="1383" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The oldest of the basilicas was the Basilica Porcia, built by the elder Cato in B.C. 184; this and the Basilica Opimia (B.C. 121) were removed, as the ground was needed for the extensions of the Forum. The Basilica Fulvia et Aemilia, built in B.C. 179, north of the shops, was extended afterwards to the edge of the Forum; as this side has not been excavated, its foundations cannot be traced. The Basilica Sempronia (B.C. 170) was erected on the site of the house of Scipio Africanus Maior, and was itself replaced by the magnificent Basilica Iulia, which was begun by Iulius Caesar in B.C. 54 and completed by Augustus. See <ref type="cross" target="crossbasilica">Basilica</ref>.</p>
 <p>The open space of the Forum was paved with large blocks of stone. Along the south side passed the Holy Way (<title>Via Sacra</title>), the course of which varied somewhat in different periods. Across this, at the point where it entered the Forum (north of the <title>Regia</title>), was the Arch of the Fabii (<title>Fornix Fabianus</title>), erected in B.C. 121; south of the Temple of Iulius Caesar was the Arch of Augustus (B.C. 19), <figure /> and at the upper end of the Basilica Iulia, the Arch of Tiberius (A.D. 16)—all these commemorating famous victories. The Arch of Septimius Severus (A.D. 203) is in a good state of preservation, though the six horses and the chariot which stood upon it, with Victory placing a crown upon the head of Severus, have long since disappeared. Several columns surmounted by statues stood in the Forum; the latest of them, the tasteless Column of Phocas (A.D. 608), is still in place, without the image.</p>
 <p>Near the northwest corner of the Forum was the only prison in Rome (<seg lang="la">carcer</seg>), comprising a large upper and smaller lower dungeon, the latter of very ancient construction. East of the prison was the open space of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitium">Comitium</ref> (q.v.). Here were the ancient Senate-house (<title>Curia Hostilia</title>) and the Speakers' Platform, called Rostra, because ornamented with the beaks of the ships taken from the Antiates in B.C. 338. Both were removed by Caesar, <cb /> who commenced the erection of a new Senate-house (<title>Curia Iulia</title>, finished by Augustus) and the rebuilding of the Rostra at the upper end of the Forum; when the Rostra began to be used in the new location is a matter of doubt. The Platform in its final form was about 78 feet long, 33 feet wide, and 10 feet high; the top was adorned with statues. A second Speakers' Platform (<title>Rostra Iulia</title>) was erected in front of the Temple of Iulius Caesar, forming part of the façade, and was ornamented with the beaks of ships taken at the battle of Actium. Near the southwest corner of the Rostra was the Golden Milestone (<title>Milliarium Aureum</title>), erected by Augustus, from which distances were calculated on the Roman roads; at the northwest corner Constantine set up the Umbilicus Romae, in the form of a cone, as the ideal centre of the city and the Roman world. There is much uncertainty in regard to the plan and location of several other structures about the Forum, as the Secretarium Senatus and Graecostasis. Somewhere near the middle of the open space was the Lacus Curtius, which appears to have become a dry <seg lang="la">puteal</seg> by the time of Augustus; near the Temple of Castor was the Lacus Iuturnae, which was still known in the Middle Ages.</p>
 <p>The first extension of the Forum, made by Iulius Caesar (<title>Forum Caesaris</title> or <title>Forum Iulium</title>, see Map of Rome), was east of the Arx; in the centre was a Temple of Venus Genetrix, in front of which stood a bronze statue of Caesar's war-horse ( <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 61" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>61</bibl>). On the east side of this Augustus built a second extension (<title>Forum Augusti</title>), in which was the splendid Temple of Mars Ultor (dedicated B.C. 2), adorned with costly works of art. Nearer the Forum Romanum Vespasian laid off a similar area, and erected in it the magnificent Temple of Peace (<title>Templum Pacis</title>). This was connected with the forums of Caesar and Augustus by the Forum of Nerva , which was planned and almost finished by his predecessor Domitian; the boundary-wall 
<pb n="1384" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01384">
<head orig="Restoration of the Forum.">Restoration of the Forum.</head>
</figure>
 was richly ornamented with Corinthian columns and reliefs, and in it was a prostyle hexastyle Temple of Minerva, also of the Corinthian order. The last and finest of the imperial forums was that of Trajan, who cut away the ridge between the Capitoline and Quirinal to make room for it. It was entered from the Forum of Augustus, through a high triumphal arch. From this the visitor passed into an area with colonnades on either side, which opened out into two semicircular extensions; at the upper end of the latter was the great Basilica Ulpia. Beyond the Basilica was a small area in which rose the immense column of Trajan (without the base 97 feet,=100 Roman feet, high), adorned with reliefs celebrating his campaigns against Decebalus. On either side of this were two buildings in which a large library was stored (<title>Bibliotheca Ulpia</title>); just beyond them Hadrian erected a temple in honour of Trajan and Plotina.</p>
 <p>The greater part of the Palatine Hill in the Republican period was given up to the residences of wealthy citizens. There were, however, several <figure id="fig.01384.2">
<head orig="Restoration of Hadrian's Mausoleum.">Restoration of Hadrian's Mausoleum.</head>
</figure> <cb /> temples the location of which, even now that a considerable portion of the hill has been excavated, has not been determined with exactness. Somewhere on the northern side was the very ancient Temple of Victory; farther down towards the Via Sacra lay the Temple of Iupiter Stator. Of later date were the Temple of the Magna Mater (dedicated B.C. 191), and the Temple of Iupiter Victor (see Plan), which seems to have been changed into a temple of the Sun by Elagabalus. But these temples were eclipsed in splendour by the Temple of Apollo, dedicated B.C. 28; the site of this, and of the library connected with it, has not yet been cleared.</p>
 <p>Augustus, who was born on the Palatine, made it a place of imperial residence. His palace, enlarged by the additions of his successors (<title>Domus Augustana</title>), became the nucleus of a complex of palatial edifices to the magnificence of which the world has elsewhere afforded no parallel. (The arrangement in general, so far as the excavations have gone, may be made out from the Plan.) Tiberius 
<pb n="1385" /><cb /> seems to have had a separate palace before his father's death (<title>Domus Tiberiana</title>). Caligula added to this; and, utilizing the roofs of intermediate buildings, he made a bridge from the Palatine to the Capitoline. Nero, after the nine-days fire in July, A.D. 64, extended his Golden House (<title>Domus Aurea</title>) over the Velia and even to the Esquiline; together with the Palace on the Palatine it must have covered about a square mile, but the parts beyond the Palatine were removed by the following emperors. The Stadium was probably built by Hadrian. Septimius Severus extended the palace beyond the Stadium; at the southeast corner, overlooking the Via Appia, he erected the <figure id="fig.01385">
<head orig="Plan of the Palatine.">Plan of the Palatine.</head>
</figure> Septizonium, a beautiful marble balcony in at least three stories. On the slope of the Palatine at the middle of the south side was the Paedagogium, a school for the pages of the imperial household.</p>
 <p>North of the Palatine ran the Via Sacra, connecting at the east end with a street that skirted the southeast side and led into the Via Appia near the Porta Capena. Across the Via Sacra at the highest point of the Velia was the Arch of Titus, commemorating his victories over the Jews in A.D. 70 (dedicated in A.D. 81 by Domitian). Near this was the magnificent Temple of Venus and Rome, built by Hadrian, with two great apsidal niches facing in opposite directions (partly incorporated <cb /> in the church of S. Francesca Romana). Further towards the Forum was the Basilica of Constantine, the main part of which was erected by Maxentius before B.C. 312; its remains are among the most impressive in Rome. At the end of the Via Sacra the triumphal Arch of Constantine is still standing, not far from the Colosseum. See <ref type="cross" target="crossarcus">Arcus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Colosseum (probably so named from the colossus of Nero, more than 100 feet high, which stood near it) was commenced by Vespasian, and dedicated by Titus in A.D. 80, but it seems not to have been entirely finished till later. It is in the form of an ellipse, the circuit of which measures nearly one-third of a mile (1728 feet), the major axis 615 feet, the minor axis 510 feet; the area is about 5.7 acres. The four stories furnished seats for 87,000 spectators. More ample still was the Circus Maximus, which was first provided with a permanent structure by Caesar; his building was in three stories, the first of stone, the other two of wood, and was about 2130 feet long, seating 150,000 spectators. This Circus was several times burned, rebuilt, and enlarged; before A.D. 79 it accommodated 250,000 spectators, and at the beginning of the fourth century its capacity is said to have reached the incredible number of 485,000. See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The other great buildings in the eastern part of 
<pb n="1386" /><cb /> Rome were the Thermae of Titus ( III.), erected in A.D. 80 on a part of the site of the Golden House. The Thermae of Caracalla (<title>Thermae Antoninianae</title>, Reg. XII.) could accommodate at one time 1600 bathers, and were of unparalleled magnificence. The quadrangular enclosure (see Map of Rome) measures more than a fifth of a mile (1081 feet) on each side, and the ruins now have something of the appearance of a great fortress. On the Quirinal (Reg. VI.) were the immense Thermae of Diocletian (dedicated in A.D. 305), part of the remains of which have been turned to use in modern edifices, and the Thermae of Constantine, which, though restored as late as A.D. 443, have left few traces. See <ref type="cross" target="crossthermae">Thermae</ref>.</p>
 <p>The public edifices in the Campus Martius were numerous and important. Here was the Theatre of Pompey (erected B.C. 55); with this was connected the Porticus Pompei, together with the Exedra, in which stood the statue of Pompey mentioned in the narratives of the death of Caesar. Nearer the Capitoline and the Tiber were the Theatre of Marcellus, of which an imposing section of exterior wall is still to be seen, and the Theatre of Balbus, both dedicated in B.C. 11; among other buildings erected during the reign of Augustus were the Porticus of Octavia and Porticus of Philippus, both named after relatives of the emperor, the Thermae of Agrippa, and the original Pantheon. The Pantheon in its present form, dating from the reign of Hadrian (though the inscription of Agrippa is still on the front of the Portico), is not only in a better state of preservation than any other Roman edifice, but ranks high among remarkable buildings. Its plan has the form of a circle 140 feet in diameter on the inside, with a rectangular portico sustained by sixteen Corinthian columns of granite 39 feet high. Over the round structure, which is of brick, is a massive dome 140 feet at its highest point above the paved floor; the building is lighted by an aperture, 30 feet in diameter, at the centre of the dome. Near the Tiber, in the northern part of the Campus Martius, was the huge Mausoleum of Augustus, the chambers of which were used as burial-places for members of the imperial family down to Nerva. To his reign <cb /> also belonged the completion of the new Saepta, commenced by Iulius Caesar; this, originally an open space marked off to facilitate voting by centuries, was now surrounded by marble porticos, and provided with elaborate barriers of division. The Stadium, built by the emperor Domitian for Greek games, had seats for 30,000 spectators; the Circus of Flaminius (B.C. 221) was probably still larger. In the Campus Martius were many temples, early and late, as those of Hope (<title>Templum Spei</title>), of Neptune (eleven columns remain), and of the Egyptian Isis. The Column of Marcus Aurelius, similar to that of Trajan, is well preserved; the triumphal arches across the Via Lata have disappeared.</p>
 <p>The famous Temple of Aesculapius, founded in B.C. 291, was on the island in the Tiber. On the right bank of the river was a Circus, built for the most part by Caligula, but named after Nero. East of this Hadrian erected his massive Mausoleum (now Castello di S. Angelo), in the form of a drum of masonry, 240 feet in diameter, resting on a square base measuring 341 feet on the sides; the whole structure was about 165 feet high, and on the top was a gilded statue of the emperor. Near by he built a Circus.</p>

<head orig="Romŭlus">Romulus</head>

 <p> The name of the mythical founder of Rome. According to the popular Roman tradition, <cb /> recorded in the first book of Livy , he was the son of Mars and Ilia or Rhea Silvia, daughter of Numitor, and was born at the same birth with Remus. Amulius, who had usurped the throne of Alba, in defiance of the right of his elder brother Numitor, ordered the infants to be thrown into the Tiber, and their mother to be buried alive, the doom of a vestal virgin who violated her vow of chastity. The river happened at that time to have overflowed its banks, so that the two infants were not carried into the middle of the stream, but drifted along the margin, till the basket which contained them became entangled in the roots of a wild vine at the foot of the Palatine Hill. At this time a she-wolf, coming down to the river to drink, suckled the infants, and carried them to her den among the thickets hard by. Here they were found by Faustulus, the king's herdsman, who took them home to his wife Laurentia, by whom they were carefully nursed, and named Romulus and Remus. The two youths grew up, employed in the labours, the sports, and the perils of the pastoral occupation of their foster-father. But their royal blood could not be quite concealed. Their superior mien, courage, and abilities soon acquired for them a decided superior<figure id="fig.01387">
<head orig="The Capitoline Wolf.">The Capitoline Wolf.</head>
</figure> ity over their young compeers, and they became leaders of the youthful herdsmen in their contests with robbers or with rivals. Having quarrelled with the herdsmen of Numitor, whose flocks were accustomed to graze on the neighbouring hill Aventinus, Remus fell into an ambuscade, and was dragged before Numitor to be punished. While Numitor, struck with the noble bearing of the youth, and influenced by the secret stirrings of nature within, was hesitating what punishment to inflict, Romulus, accompanied by Faustulus, hastened to the rescue of Remus. On their arrival at Alba, the secret of their origin was discovered, and a plan was speedily organized for the expulsion of Amulius and the restoration of their grandfather Numitor to his throne. This was soon accomplished; but the twin-brothers felt little disposition to remain in a subordinate position at Alba, after the enjoyment of the rude liberty and power to which they had been accustomed among their native hills. They therefore requested from their grandfather permission to build a city on the banks of the Tiber, where their lives had been so miraculously preserved. Scarcely had this permission been granted, when a contest arose between the two brothers respecting the site, the name, and the 
<pb n="1388" /><cb />
 sovereignty of the city which they were about to found. Romulus wished it to be built on the Palatine Hill, and to be called by his name; Remus preferred the Aventine, and his own name. To terminate their dispute amicably, they agreed to refer it to the decision of the gods by augury. Romulus took his station on the Palatine Hill, Remus on the Aventine. At sunrise Remus saw six vultures, and immediately after Romulus saw twelve. The superiority was adjudged to Romulus, because he had seen the greater number; against which decision Remus remonstrated indignantly, on the ground that he had first received an omen. Romulus then proceeded to mark out the boundaries for the wall of the intended city. This was done by a plough with a brazen ploughshare, drawn by a bull and a heifer, and so directed that the furrow should fall inward. The plough was lifted and carried over the spaces intended to be left for gates; and in this manner a square space was marked out, including the Palatine Hill, and a small portion of the land at its base, termed Roma Quadrata. This took place on the 21st of April, on the day of the festival of Pales, the goddess of shepherds. While the wall was beginning to rise above the surface, Remus, whose mind was still rankling with his discomfiture, leaped over it, scornfully saying, “Shall such a wall as that keep your city?” Immediately Romulus, or, as others say, Celer, who had charge of erecting that part of the wall, struck him dead to the ground with the implement which he held in his hand, exclaiming, “So perish whosoever shall hereafter overleap these ramparts.”</p>
 <p>By this event Romulus was left the sole sovereign of the city; yet he felt deep remorse at his brother's fate, buried him honourably, and, when he sat to administer justice, placed an empty seat by his side, with a sceptre and crown, as if acknowledging the right of his brother to the possession of equal power. To augment as speedily as possible the number of his subjects, Romulus set apart, in his new city, a place of refuge, to which any man might flee, and be there protected from his pursuers. By this device the population increased rapidly in males, but there was a great deficiency in women; for the adjoining States, regarding the followers of Romulus as little better than a horde of brigands, refused to sanction intermarriages. But the schemes of Romulus were not to be so frustrated. In honour of the god Consus, he proclaimed games, to which he invited the neighbouring States. Great numbers came, accompanied by their families, and, at an appointed signal, the Roman youth, rushing suddenly into the midst of the spectators, snatched up the unmarried women in their arms, and carried them off by force. The outrage was immediately resented, and Romulus found himself involved in a war with all the neighbouring States. Fortunately for Rome, though those States had sustained a common injury, they did not unite their forces in the common cause. They fought singly, and were each in turn defeated; Caenina, Crustumerium, and Antemnae fell successively before the Roman arms. Romulus slew with his own hands Acron, king of Caenina, and bore off his spoils, dedicating them, as <seg lang="la">spolia opima</seg>, to Iupiter Feretrius. The third part of the lands of the conquered towns was seized by the victors, and such of the people of these towns as were willing to remove to Rome were received as free citizens. In the meantime, <cb /> the Sabines, to avenge the insult which they had sustained, had collected together forces under Titus Tatius, king of the Quirites. The Romans were unable to meet so strong an army in the field, and withdrew within their walls. They had previously placed their flocks in what they thought a place of safety, on the Capitoline Hill, which, strong as it was by nature, they had still further secured by additional fortifications. Tarpeia, the daughter of the commander of that fortress, having fallen into the hands of the Sabines, agreed to betray the access to the hill for the ornaments they wore upon their arms. At their approach she opened the gate, and, as they entered, they crushed her to death beneath their shields. From her the cliff of the Capitoline Hill was called the Tarpeian Rock. The attempt of the Romans to regain this place of strength brought on a general engagement. The combat was long and doubtful. At one time the Romans were almost driven into the city, which the Sabines were on the point of entering along with them, when fresh courage was infused into the fugitives in consequence of Romulus vowing a temple to Iupiter Stator, and by a stream of water which rushed out of the Temple of Ianus and swept away the Sabines from the gate. The struggle was renewed during several successive days with various fortune and great mutual slaughter. At length the Sabine women who had been carried away, and who were now reconciled to their fate, rushed with loud outcries between the combatants, imploring their husbands and their fathers to spare on each side those who were now equally dear. Both parties paused; a conference began, a peace was concluded, and a treaty framed, by which the two nations were united into one, and Romulus and Tatius became the joint sovereigns of the united people. But, though united, each nation continued to be governed by its own king and Senate. During the double rule of Romulus and Tatius a war was undertaken against the Latin town of Cameria, which was reduced and made a Roman colony, and its people were admitted into the Roman State, as had been done with those whom Romulus previously subdued. Tatius was soon afterwards slain by the people of Laurentum, because he had refused to do them justice against his kinsmen, who had violated the laws of nations by insulting their ambassadors.</p>
 <p>The death of Tatius left Romulus sole monarch of Rome. He was soon engaged in a war with Fidenae, a Tuscan settlement on the banks of the Tiber. This people he likewise overcame, and placed in the city a Roman colony. This war, extending the Roman frontier, led to a hostile collision with Veii, in which he was also successful, and deprived Veii, at that time one of the most powerful cities of Etruria, of a large portion of its territories, though he found that the city itself was too strong to be taken. The reign of Romulus now drew near its close. One day, while holding a review of his army, on a plain near Lake Capra, the sky was suddenly overcast with gloom and a tempest of thunder and lightning arose. The people fled in dismay; and when the storm abated, Romulus, over whose head it had raged most fiercely, was nowhere to be seen. A rumour was circulated that during the tempest he had been carried to heaven by his father, the god Mars. This opinion was speedily confirmed by the report of Iulius Proculus, who declared that, as he was 
<pb n="1389" /><cb />
 returning by night from Alba to Rome, Romulus appeared before him in a form of more than mortal majesty, and bade him go and tell the Romans that Rome was destined by the gods to be the chief city of the earth; that human power should never be able to withstand her people; and that he himself would be their guardian god Quirinus ( Romulus; <bibl n="Liv.  1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 4</bibl>).

This new platform, which was afterwards repeatedly restored, appears by the existing remains to have consisted of an erection eleven feet higher than the pavement of the Forum, about seventy-eight feet in length, and thirty-three feet in depth. The front was decorated with two rows of ships' prows. The way up to the platform was at the back. This platform also was used down to the latest times of the Empire as a place for setting up honorary statues.

<head orig="Rufīnus">Rufinus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">P. Cornelius Rufīnus</hi>. A Roman who was consul in B.C. 290 with M' Curius Dentatus, and in conjunction with his colleague brought the Samnite War to a conclusion, and obtained a triumph in consequence. He was consul a second time in 277, and carried on the war against the Samnites and the Greeks in Southern Italy. The chief event of his second consulship was the capture of the important town of Croton. In 275 Rufinus was expelled from the Senate by the censors C. Fabricius and Q. Aemilius Papus, on account of his possessing ten pounds of silver plate. The dictator Sulla was descended from this Rufinus. His grandson was the first of the family who assumed the surname of Sulla.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Licinius Rufīnus</hi>. A jurist who lived under Alexander Severus. There are in the Digest seventeen excerpts from twelve books of <title>Regulae</title> by Rufinus.</p>
 <p>(3) The chief minister of state under Theodosius the Great, and an able but at the same time a treacherous and dangerous man. He instigated Theodosius to those cruel measures which brought ruin upon Antioch, A.D. 390. After the death of Theodosius in 395, Rufinus exercised paramount influence over the weak Arcadius; but towards the end of the year a conspiracy was formed against him by Eutropius and Stilicho, who induced Gainas, the Gothic ally of Arcadius, to join in the plot. Rufinus was in consequence slain by the troops of Gainas.</p>
 <p>(4) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tyrannius</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Turranius</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Torānus</hi>. A celebrated ecclesiastical writer, born probably about A.D. 345 in Italy. He was at first an inmate of the monastery at Aquileia, and he afterwards resided many years at a monastery in Palestine, where he became very intimate with St. Jerome. The two friends afterwards quarrelled, and Jerome attacked Rufinus with the utmost vehemence on <cb /> account of his supporting the tenets of Origen. After remaining in the East for about twenty-six years, Rufinus returned to Italy in 397, where he published a Latin translation of the Apology for Origen by Pamphilus, and of the books of Origen, <title>De Principiis</title>, together with an original tract, <title>De Adulteratione Librorum Origenis.</title> In the preface to the <title>De Principiis</title> he quoted a panegyric which Jerome had at an earlier period pronounced upon Origen. This led to a bitter correspondence between the two former friends, which was crowned by the <title>Apologia</title> of the one <title>adversus Hieronymum</title>, and the <title>Apologia</title> of the other <title>adversus Rufinum.</title> Rufinus died in Sicily in 410, to which island he had fled upon the invasion of Italy by Alaric. Several of his works are extant, the chief edition being that of Vallarsi <bibl default="NO">(Verona, 1745)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(5) The author of a little poem in twenty-two lines, <title>Pasiphaës Fabula ex Omnibus Metris Horatianis</title>, which, as the name imports, contains an example of each of the different metres employed by Horace. His date is quite uncertain, but he may be the same person with the following. Edited by Bährens in the <title>Poet. Lat. Min.</title> vol. v.</p>
 <p>(6) A grammarian of Antioch, whose treatise <title>De Metris Comicis</title>, or rather extracts from it, is contained in the <title>Grammatici Latini</title> of Keil, vi. 569.</p>
 <p>(7) The author of thirty-eight epigrams in the Greek Anthology. His date is uncertain, but there can be no doubt that he was a Byzantine. His verses are of the same light amatory character as those of Agathias, Paulus, Macedonius, and others.

 <p>A young Roman noble distinguished as an elegant writer and eloquent speaker, but equally conspicuous for his profligacy and extravagance. Notwithstanding his vices he lived on intimate terms with Cicero, who defended him in B.C. 56 in an oration still extant. The accusation was brought against him by Sempronius Atratinus, at the instigation of Clodia Quadrantaria, whom he had lately deserted. Clodia charged him with having borrowed money from her in order to murder Dion, the head of the embassy sent by Ptolemy Auletes to Rome, and with having made an attempt to poison her. In 52 Caelius was tribune of the plebs and in 50 aedile. During the years 51 and 50 he carried on an active correspondence with Cicero, who was then in Cilicia, and many of the letters which he wrote to Cicero at that time are preserved in the collection of Cicero's Letters. On the breaking out of the Civil War in 49 he espoused Caesar's side, and was rewarded for his services by the praetorship in 48. Being at this time overwhelmed with debt, he availed himself of Caesar's absence from Italy to bring forward a law for the abolition of debts. He was, however, resisted by the other magistrates and deprived of his office; whereupon he went into the south of Italy to join <ref type="cross" target="crossmilo">Milo</ref> (q.v.), whom he had secretly sent for from Massilia.

 <p> <hi rend="SmallCaps" />David . A classical scholar, born January 2d, 1723, at Stolpe, in Pomerania. He was educated at the Königsberg Gymnasium and at Wittenberg University, where he spent two years in the assiduous study of ancient literature, history, and jurisprudence. Afterwards he went to Leyden, where for six years he prosecuted his classical studies under the guidance of Hemsterhuis, and bestowed particular attention on the Greek writers. He planned a new edition of Plato, collected the scholia of that author, and published an edition of Timaeus's <bibl default="NO"><title>Lexicon Vocum Platonicarum</title> (Leyden, 1754; reëdited in a much improved form, 1833)</bibl>. He went in 1755 to Paris, where, for a whole year, he examined the MSS. of the Royal Library and of the Library of Saint-Germain. Hemsterhuis had him appointed as <seg lang="la">lector</seg> (reader) in the University of Leyden, in which capacity he was the assistant and colleague of his great master. In October, 1757, he introduced his series of lectures by a discourse, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Graecia Artium et Doctrinarum Inventrice</title> (Leyden, 1757)</bibl>. For four years he discharged the duties of his office with skill and success, and in 1761 succeeded Oudendorp in the chair of Eloquence and History. In 1774 he succeeded Gronovius as librarian to the University, which he enriched with a multitude of valuable books and MSS. He died May 14th, 1798, and in gratitude to his memory the city of Leyden purchased his great library, and gave his widow an annuity of 500 florins.</p>
 <p>Ruhnken will long be remembered as one of the best scholars and critics of the eighteenth century. His fine taste and sagacity, aided by an astonishing memory and vast learning, enabled him to illustrate the authors of antiquity with wonderful success. He was also a brilliant lecturer, for which he was, no doubt, indebted to the extreme lucidity and grace of his Latin style. In addition to the works already noted, he published editions of vol. ii. of Alberti's <title>Hesychius;</title> of Rutilius Lupus; of Velleius Paterculus; of Muretus; of the Homeric Hymns; and wrote a history of the Greek orators <bibl default="NO">(1768; last ed.
