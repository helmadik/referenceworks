<head orig="Hades">Hades</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἅιδης</foreign>). According to the belief current among the Greeks, the world of the dead, or the abode of Hades, with its wide doors, was in the depths of the earth. In the <title>Odyssey</title>, its entrance and outer court were on the western side of the river Oceanus, in the ground sacred to Persephoné, with its grove of barren willows and poplars. Here was the home of the Cimmerians, veiled in darkness and cloud, where the sun never shines. This court, and indeed the lower world in general, is a meadow of asphodel, an unattractive weed of dreary aspect usually planted on graves. The actual abode of the subterranean powers is Erebus (<foreign lang="greek">Ἔρεβος</foreign>), or the impenetrable darkness. In later times entrances to the lower world were imagined in other places where there were cavernous hollows which looked as if they led into the bowels of the earth. Such places were Hermioné and the promontory of Taenarum in the Peloponnesus, Heraclea on the Euxine, and Cumae in Italy, where the mythical Cimmerii were also localized. The lower world of Homer is intersected by great rivers—the Styx, Acheron (“river of woe”), Cocytus (“river of wailing”), a branch of the Styx, Phlegethon and Pyriphlegethon (“rivers of fire”). The last two unite and join the waters of the Acheron. In the post-Homeric legend, these rivers are represented as surrounding the infernal regions, and another river appears with them, that of Lethé, or oblivion. In the waters of Lethé the souls of the dead drank forgetfulness of their earthly existence. The lower world once conceived as separated from the upper by these rivers, the idea of a ferryman arose. This was <ref type="cross" target="crosscharon">Charon</ref> (q.v.), the son of Erebus and of Nyx, a gloomy, sullen old man, who took the souls in his boat across Acheron into the realm of shadows. The souls were brought down from the upper world by Hermes, and paid the ferryman an obolus, which was put for this purpose into the mouths of the dead. Charon had the right to refuse a passage to souls whose bodies had not been duly buried. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfunus">Funus</ref>, p. 697.) In Homer it is the spirits themselves who refuse to receive any one to whom funeral honours have not been paid. At the gate lies the dog Cerberus, son of Typhaon and Echidna. He is a terrible monster with three heads, and mane and tail of snakes. He is friendly to the spirits who enter, but if any one tries to escape he seizes him and holds him fast.</p>
 <p>The ghosts of the dead were in ancient times conceived as incorporeal images of their former selves, without mind or consciousness. In the <title>Odyssey</title> the seer Tiresias is the only one who has retained his consciousness and judgment, and this as an exceptional gift of Persephoné. But they have the power of drinking the blood of animals, and having done so they recover their consciousness and power of speech. The soul, therefore, is 
<pb n="761" /><cb />
 not conceived as entirely annihilated. The ghosts retain the outer form of their body, and follow, but instinctively only, what was their favourite pursuit in life. Orion in Homer is still a hunter, Minos sits in judgment, as when alive. Perhaps the punishments inflicted in Homer on Tityus, Tantalus, and Sisyphus (Ixion, the Danaides, Pirithoüs, and others belong to a later story) should be regarded in this light. The penalties inflicted on them in the upper world may be merely transferred by Homer to their ghostly existence; for the idea of a sensible punishment is not consistent with that of an unconscious continuance in being. It must be remembered, at the same time, that Homer several times mentions that the Erinyes punish perjurers after death. It must be concluded, then, that the ancient belief is, in this instance, found side by side with the later and generally received idea that the dead, even without drinking blood, preserved their consciousness and power of speech. Connected with it is the notion that they have the power of influencing men's life on earth in various ways. The most ancient belief knows nothing of future rewards of the righteous, or, indeed, of any complete separation between the just and the unjust, or of a judgment to make the necessary awards. The judges of the dead are in the later legend Minos, Rhadamanthys, Aeacus, and Triptolemus. It was a later age, too, which transferred Elysium and Tartarus to the lower world—Elysium as the abode of the blessed, and Tartarus as that of the damned. In the earlier belief these regions had nothing to do with the realm of Hades. The name Tartarus (<foreign lang="greek">Τάρταρος</foreign>) was in later times often applied to the whole of the lower world. The spirits of those who had lived a life of average merit were imagined as wandering on the asphodel meadow. See in English literature the <title>Epic of Hades</title>, by Lewis Morris, and <title>Ades, King of Hell</title>, by Buchanan.</p>
 <p>In general it must be said that the ancient ideas of a future life were always subject to considerable changes, owing to the influence of the doctrines taught in the mysteries, and the representations of poets, philosophers, sculptors, and painters. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspolygnotus">Polygnotus</ref>.) The general tendency was to multiply the terrors of Hades, especially at the gates and in Tartarus. (For the deities of the lower world, see <ref type="cross" target="crosseumenides">Eumenides</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshades">Hades</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspersephone">Persephoné</ref>.) The Greek beliefs on the subject found their way to Rome through the instrumentality of the poets, especially Vergil; but they did not entirely supplant the national traditions. See Alger, <title>Critical History of the Doctrine of a Future Life</title>, with an exhaustive bibliography of the subject <bibl default="NO">(10th ed. Boston, 1880)</bibl>; Ettig, <bibl default="NO"><title>Acheruntica</title> (Leipzig, 1891)</bibl>; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crosslares">Lares</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslarvae">Larvae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmanes">Manes</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmania">Mania</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossorcus">Orcus</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀΐδης</foreign>; Attic, <foreign lang="greek">Ἅιδης</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ᾅδης [ἀϊδής</foreign>]). In Greek mythology, the son of Cronus and Rhea, who received the dominion of the lower world at the division of the universe after the fall of Cronus, his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon, being made lords respectively of the sky and sea. With his queen Persephoné he held sway over the other powers of the infernal regions, and over the ghosts of the dead. The symbol of his invisible empire was the helmet that made men invisible. This was given to him by the Cyclopes to aid him in the battle of the gods with the Giants. Originally he was, to all appearance, conceived as <cb /> bringing down the dead himself to the lower world in his chariot, or as driving them down with his staff; but in the later belief the office of conductor of souls belonged to Hermes. Hades is the enemy of all life, heartless and inexorable, and hated, accordingly, by gods and men. Sacrifice and prayer are of no avail with him, and he is therefore only worshipped on exceptional occasions. But, like Persephoné, he was sometimes represented in a milder light, being called Pluto (<foreign lang="greek">Πλοῦτων, Πλοῦτος</foreign>), or the giver of wealth. This because it is from the depths of the earth that corn and its attendant blessings are produced. As old as Hesiod is the advice to the plougher to call upon Zeus of the lower world, as well as upon Demeter. He is also styled Polydectes and Polydegmon, as receiving at last all men in his realms. <figure id="fig.00761">

 <p>The most celebrated of the myths referring to Hades is that of the rape of Persephoné. In works of art he is represented as resembling his brothers Zeus and Poseidon, but with gloomy features and hair falling over his brow, the key of the infernal world in his hand, and the dog Cerberus at his side. Sometimes he appears as a god of agriculture, with a cornucopia, or a two-pronged pickaxe. The plants sacred to him were the cypress and the narcissus; black sheep were offered to him in sacrifice. When mortals invoked him, they struck the earth with the hand.</p>
 <p>By the Romans Hades was identified partly with Orcus, partly with Dis.

 <head><surname full="yes">Hadriānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Publius Aelius</foreName>
 <p>(1) A Roman emperor, born at Rome A.D. 76. He lost his father when ten years of age, and had for his guardians Trajan, who was his relation, and Cornelius Tatianus, 
<pb n="762" /><cb /> a Roman knight. His father's name was Aelius Hadrianus Afer. It is conjectured that the surname of Afer was given the latter because he had been governor of Africa, and that he is the same Hadrianus who put the martyr Leontius to death at Tripolis in the reign of Vespasian. Hadrian's father was Trajan's first cousin; for he was the son of Ulpia, the sister of Marcus Ulpius Trajanus, the emperor Trajan's father. Hadrian began very early to serve in the army, and was tri<figure id="fig.00762">
<head orig="Coin of Hadrian.">Coin of Hadrian.</head>
</figure> bune of a legion before Domitian's death. The forces in Lower Moesia chose him to congratulate Trajan upon his being adopted by Nerva , and it was he that acquainted Trajan with the first news of Nerva 's death. He regained the emperor's favour, which he had almost entirely lost by his extravagant expenses and the debts which he had in consequence incurred, and finally married Trajan's grandniece, Sabina, chiefly through the aid of Plotina the empress. His subsequent rise was rapid, and he was the companion of Trajan in most of his expeditions. He particularly distinguished himself in the war against the Dacians, and was successively appointed praetor, governor of Pannonia, and consul. The orations he composed for Trajan increased his fame ( Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>). After the siege of Atra, in Arabia, Trajan left him in command of his army, and when he found his death approaching, adopted him, although the reality of this adoption is disputed by some authorities, who attribute his elevation to the intrigues of Plotina.</p>
 <p>On the death of Trajan he assumed the reins of government (A.D. 117), with the concurrence of the Syrian army. The Senate readily ratified the act. The first care of Hadrian was to make a peace with the Persians, and to restore all the provinces just taken from them, making the Euphrates the boundary of the Roman Empire. He had then to turn his attention to certain revolts and insurrections in Egypt, Libya, and Palestine; and, after quickly concluding a peace with the Parthians, returned to Rome, A.D. 118. The Senate decreed him a triumph, and honoured him with the title of Pater Patriae; but he refused <figure id="fig.00762.2">
<head orig="Map of Hadrian's Wall, with the chief Stations. (After Collingwood Bruce.)">Map of Hadrian's Wall, with the chief Stations. (After Collingwood Bruce.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> both, and required that Trajan's image should triumph. He sought popularity by a repeal of fifteen years accumulation of arrears of public debt, by a vast reduction of taxation generally and by immense largesses to the people. He was less generous to certain senators accused of a plot against him, four of whom, although of consular rank and intimates of Trajan, he caused to be put to death.</p>
 <p>A year after his return to Rome, Hadrian marched against the Alani, the Sarmatians, and the Dacians, but showed a greater desire to make peace with the barbarians than to extend the prowess of the Roman arms. This policy has been attributed to envy of the fame of his warlike predecessor; but a due consideration of the subsequent history of the Empire will amply justify him against the imputation; for it had reached an extent which rendered all increase to its limits a source of weakness rather than of strength. Hadrian was an active and incessant traveller, visiting every province in the Empire, not simply to indulge his curiosity, but to inspect the administration of government, repress abuses, erect and repair public edifices, and exercise all the vigilance of personal examination. (See Dürr, <title>Die Reisen des Kaisers Hadrian</title> [Vienna, 1881]). In A.D. 120, he passed over from Gaul to Britain, where he caused a wall to be built from the mouth of the Tyne to Solway Frith, in order to secure the Roman provinces from the incursions of the Caledonians.</p>
 <p>Like Trajan, he lived familiarly with his friends, but was much more suspicious, and would not repose in them the same confidence. When at Rome he cultivated all kinds of literature, conversing with learned men, and giving and receiving information in their society. Hadrian had once again to visit the East to repress the Parthians, who paid little regard to treaties. On his return he passed the winter at Athens, and was initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries. He published no edict against the Christians, yet they nevertheless suffered considerable persecution, until, upon the remonstrance of Quadratus, bishop of Athens, and Aristides, an eminent Christian, he ordered the persecution to cease; but no credit is due to the unauthorized assertion of Lampridius that he thought of building a temple to the Saviour. His treatment of the Jews, on the other hand, was extremely severe, though ample provocation had been given by that turbulent people, for they had raised disturbances towards the end of Trajan's reign, which were not completely quelled until the second year of Hadrian. But now a more formidable insurrection broke out under Barcochebas (“Son of a Star”), who, though a robber by profession, had given himself out as the Messiah. It required a war of three years to reduce the revolted Jews to complete subjection, and after this was accomplished, 
<pb n="763" /><cb />
 there was scarcely any indignity that was not inflicted on the conquered nation. Jerusalem was rebuilt under the new title of Aelia Capitolina, uniting the family name of the emperor with <figure id="fig.00763">
<head orig="Hadrian. (British Museum.)">Hadrian. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> the Roman surname of Iupiter; and in the execution of his plan Hadrian studiously profaned all the places which had been most revered by both Jews and Christians, whom he seems to have confounded together. He built a temple in honour of Iupiter Capitolinus upon the mountain where had stood that of the true God; placed a marble hog upon that gate of the city which looked towards Bethlehem; erected in the place where Jesus was crucified a statue of Venus; and in that where he rose from the dead, an image of Iupiter. In the grotto of Bethlehem, where the Saviour was born, he established the worship of Adonis. The Jews were also forbidden the very sight of Jerusalem, which they were not permitted to enter save on one day in the year—the anniversary of the destruction of the city. After the conclusion of the Jewish War Hadrian returned to Italy, where a lingering illness put a stop to his unsettled mode of life, and eventually terminated his existence. Having no children of his own, Hadrian first adopted for his successor L. Ceionius Commodus, more generally known by the name of Verus, to which last he prefixed that of Aelius after his adoption by the emperor. Verus, however, who was remarkable for nothing but his excessive effeminacy and debauched <cb /> mode of life, died soon after, and Hadrian made a very excellent selection in the person of Antoninus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossantoninus">Antoninus Pius</ref>.) Hadrian died not long after at Baiae, A.D. 138, in the sixtythird year of his age and the twenty-second of his reign. His disorder was the dropsy, from which disease his sufferings were so great as apparently to affect his reason.</p>
 <p>Hadrian was, in general, a just and able ruler, yet there were times when he showed himself revengeful, suspicious, and cruel. His treatment of his wife Sabina does no honour to his memory, his passion for <ref type="cross" target="crossantinous">Antinoüs</ref> (q.v.) taints it; while his excessive superstition, to which even that favourite fell a victim, entitles him to a large measure of contempt. He was, in fact, a peculiar character, full of paradoxes—witty, pedantic, droll, dull, impulsive, sociable, suspicious, morbidly self-conscious, and persevering in nothing. The greater portion of the Romans appear to have formed a just estimate of his character long before his death, and it was with difficulty that Antoninus could obtain from the Senate the usual compliment of having him ranked among the gods. Their dread of the soldiery, by whom Hadrian was greatly beloved, appears to have conquered their reluctance.</p>
 <p>Hadrian did much towards restoring and improving the city of Rome. He also erected a splendid temple to Trajan, a temple to Venus and Roma, and the great Mausoleum in the district beyond the Tiber, now known as the Castle of St. Angelo. In this, he and a number of his successors were buried. For an illustration of it see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossmausoleum">Mausoleum</ref>.</p>
 <p>Hadrian wrote several works. He was fond of entering the lists against the poets, philosophers, and orators of the day, and Photius mentions several declamations of the emperor's, written for such occasions, as still existing in his time, and not devoid of elegance. Hadrian composed a history of his own times, which he published under the name of his freedman Phlegon; and Doritheus the grammarian made at a subsequent period a collection of his decisions and rescripts. All that we have of his productions at the present day are some speeches, decrees, and (Greek) epigrams, and an epigrammatic address to his soul, written a <figure id="fig.00763.2">

<head orig="Hamilcar">Hamilcar</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀμίλκας</foreign>). (1) A Carthaginian general, son of Mago, or, according to others, of Hanno , conquered by Gelon, in Sicily, the same day that Xerxes was defeated at Salamis. Herodotus (vii. 165) states that he was never seen either living or dead after the battle in which his army was defeated. According to Polyaenus, however (i. 27, 2), Gelon destroyed him by a stratagem while sacrificing.</p>
 <p>(2) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossrhodanus">Rhodănus</ref>, a Carthaginian general of considerable talent. Perceiving his fellow-citizens to be greatly disquieted at the projects of Alexander of Macedon (B.C. 332), he betook himself to that prince, in order, if possible, to penetrate his designs, and give his countrymen timely notice of them. After the death of Alexander he returned to Carthage, where he was put to death, on false accusations of treason, as the recompense of his devotion to his country ( <bibl n="Just.  21. 5" default="NO">Just.xxi. 5</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) A Carthaginian general, in the time of Agathocles, tyrant of Sicily. He came to the succour of Syracuse when besieged by that usurper. Being gained over, however, by the gold of Agathocles, he prevailed on the Syracusans to make peace, and favoured by his inaction the schemes of the tyrant. The Carthaginian Senate condemned him to lose his head, but he died at Syracuse, B.C. 311, before the sentence could be made public ( <bibl n="Just.  22. 2" default="NO">Just.xxii. 2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(4) The son of Giscon; a Carthaginian general, sent into Sicily about B.C. 311, to oppose the progress of Agathocles. On his arrival he gained a victory, which opened to him the gates of several large cities. In attempting to make himself master of Syracuse, during the absence of Agathocles in Africa, he was taken prisoner and put to death, B.C. 309.</p>
 <p>(5) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossbarca">Barca</ref>, the leader of the popular party at Carthage, appointed in the eighteenth year of the First Punic War (B.C. 247) to the command of the Carthaginian armies. No particulars have been preserved respecting his early life or the time of his birth; but it is learned from Nepos (<title>Hamil.</title> 1) that he was very young when he obtained the command. He ravaged with his fleet the coast of the Bruttii and 
<pb n="766" /><cb />
 the Epizephyrian Locrians, and afterwards seized upon a strong fortress in Sicily, which was situated between Eryx and Panormus. In this place he continued for some years, with very little support from the Carthaginian government; and, although the Romans were masters of almost the whole of the island, they were unable to dislodge him. He frequently ravaged the southern coasts of Italy as far as Cumae, and defeated the Roman troops in Sicily. On one occasion he took Eryx, which he held till the conclusion of the war. The Romans at length fitted out a fleet to cut off all communication between Hamilcar and Carthage; the Carthaginian fleet sent to his assistance was defeated by the Roman consul Lutatius Catulus (B.C. 241), and the Carthaginians were obliged to sue for peace. This was granted by the Romans; and Hamilcar led his troops from Eryx to Lilybaeum, whence they were conveyed to Africa. But a new danger awaited Carthage. The Carthaginian treasury was exhausted; and it was proposed to the troops that they should relinquish a part of the pay which was due to them. The soldiers rejected the proposal, appointed two of their number, Spendius and Matho, commanders, and proceeded to enforce their demands. Being joined by many of the native tribes of Africa, they defeated Hanno , the Carthaginian general sent against them, and brought Carthage to the brink of ruin. In these desperate circumstances Hamilcar was appointed to the command, and at length succeeded in subduing them after the war had lasted three years and four months. After the end of this war Hamilcar was sent into Spain (B.C. 238). He remained in Spain nearly nine years, during which time he extended the dominion of Carthage over the southern and eastern parts of that country. He fell in a battle against the natives (B.C. 229), leaving three sons, Hasdrubal, Mago, and Hannibal.</p>
 <p>The abilities of Hamilcar were of the highest order; and he directed all the energies of his mind to diminish the power of Rome. Polybius states his belief (Bk. iii.) that his administration would soon have produced another war with the Romans, if he had not been prevented by the disorders in which his country was involved through the war of the mercenaries. Hamilcar was succeeded in his command in Spain by his son-in-law Hasdrubal, who must not be confounded with Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal. See Polyb. i., ii.; Corn. Nep. <title>Hamil.</title> 3, and the striking picture given in Flaubert's novel, <title>Salammbô.</title></p>
 <p>(6) A Carthaginian general, son of Bomilcar, conquered by the Scipios (B.C. 215) when besieging Ilitingis, in Hispania Baetica, along with Hasdrubal and Mago. He is supposed by some to be the same with the Hamilcar who, fifteen years after, at the head of a body of Gauls, took and sacked Placentia, and was defeated and slain before Cremona. Others affirm that he was taken prisoner three years later in a battle fought near the Mincius, and served to grace the victory of the conqueror (<bibl n="Liv.  23. 49" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiii. 49</bibl>; xxxi. 10; xxxii. 23; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

It does not appear how long Hannibal remained in Spain, but he was at a very early age associated with Hasdrubal, who succeeded his father in the command of the Carthaginian army in that country.</p>
 <p>On the death of Hasdrubal, B.C. 221, he obtained the undivided command of the army, and quickly conquered the Olcades, Vaccaeans, Carpesians and the other Spanish tribes that had not been subdued by Hasdrubal. The inhabitants of Saguntum, alarmed at his success, sent messengers to Rome to inform the Romans of their danger. A Roman embassy was accordingly sent to Hannibal, who was passing the winter at Carthago Nova, to announce to him that the independence of Saguntum was guaranteed by a treaty between the Carthaginians and Romans (concluded B.C. 226), and that they should consider any injury done to the Saguntines as a declaration of war against themselves. Hannibal, however, paid no regard to this remonstrance. More than twenty years had elapsed since the termination of the First Punic War, during which period the Carthaginians had recovered their strength, and had obtained possession of the greater part of Spain; and now a favourable opportunity had arrived for renewing the war with the Romans. In B.C. 219, Hannibal took <ref type="cross" target="crosssaguntum">Saguntum</ref> (q.v.) after a siege of eight months, and employed the winter in making preparations for the invasion of Italy. He first provided for the security of Africa and Spain by leaving an army of about 16,000 men in each country. The army in Africa consisted principally of Spanish troops, and that in Spain of Africans, under the command of his brother Hasdrubal. He had already received promises of support from the Gauls who inhabited the north of Italy, and who were anxious to deliver themselves from Roman domination. Having thus made every necessary preparation, he set out from Carthago Nova, late in the spring of B.C. 218, with an army of 80,000 foot and 12,000 horse. In his march from the Iberus to the Pyrenees he was opposed by a great number of the native tribes, but these were quickly defeated, though with loss. Before crossing the Pyrenees, he left 
<pb n="767" /><cb /> Hanno to secure his recent conquests with a detachment from his own army of 11,000 men. He sent back the same number of Spanish troops to their own cities, and with an army now reduced to 50,000 foot and 9000 horse he advanced to the Rhone.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, two Roman armies had been levied: one, commanded by the consul P. Cornelius Scipio, was intended to oppose Hannibal in Spain; and a second, under the consul T. Sempronius, was designed for the invasion of Africa. The departure of Scipio was delayed by a revolt of the Boian and Insubrian Gauls, against whom was sent the army which had been intended for the invasion of Spain, under the command of one of the praetors. Scipio was therefore obliged to remain in Rome until a new army could be raised. When the forces were ready, he sailed with them to the Rhone, and anchored at the eastern mouth of the river, being persuaded that Hannibal must still be at a considerable distance from him, as the country through which he had to march was diffi<figure id="fig.00767">
<head orig="Hannibal. (Von Falke.)">Hannibal. (Von Falke.)</head>
</figure> cult, and inhabited by many warlike tribes. Hannibal, however, quickly surmounted all these obstacles, crossed the Rhone, though not without some opposition from the Gauls, and continued his march up the left bank of the river. Scipio did not arrive at the place where the Carthaginians had crossed the river till three days afterwards; and, despairing of overtaking them, he sailed back to Italy with the intention of meeting Hannibal when he should descend from the Alps. Scipio sent his brother Gnaeus into Spain, with the greater part of the troops, to oppose Hasdrubal. Hannibal continued his march up the Rhone till he came to the Isara. Marching along that river, he crossed the Alps, descended into the valley of the Dora Baltea, and followed the course of the river till he arrived in the territories of the Insubrian Gauls. See Troger, <bibl default="NO"><title>Hannibal's Zug</title> (Innsbruck, 1878)</bibl>; Buchheister, <bibl default="NO"><title>Hannibal's Zug über die Alpen</title> (Hamburg, 1887)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Hannibal completed his march from Carthago Nova to Italy in five months, during which time he lost a great number of men, especially in his pas sage <cb /> over the Alps. According to a statement engraved by his order on a column at Lacinium, in the country of the Brutii, which Polybius saw, his army was reduced to 12,000 Africans, 8000 Spaniards, and 6000 cavalry when he arrived in the territories of the Insubrian Gauls. After remaining some time in the neighborhood of the Insubrians to recruit his army, he marched south ward, and encountered P. Cornelius Scipio on the right bank of the river Ticinus. In the battle which ensued the Romans were defeated, and Scipio, with the remainder of the army, retreating along the left bank of the Po, crossed the river before Hannibal could overtake him and encamped near Placentia. He afterwards retreated more to the south, and intrenched himself strongly on the right bank of the Trebia, where he waited for the arrival of the army under the other consul, T. Sempronius. Sempronius had already crossed over into Sicily with the intention of sailing to Africa, when he was recalled to join his colleague. After the union of the two armies, Sempronius determined, against the advice of Scipio, to risk another battle. The skill and fortune of Hannibal again prevailed; the Romans were entirely defeated, and the troops who survived took refuge in the fortified cities. In consequence of these victories, the whole of Cisalpine Gaul fell into the hands of Hannibal; and the Gauls, who, on his first arrival, were prevented from joining him by the presence of Scipio's army in their country, now eagerly assisted him with both men and supplies.</p>
 <p>In the following year, B.C. 217, the Romans made great preparations to oppose their formidable enemy. Two new armies were levied. One was posted at Arretium, under the command of the consul Flaminius, and the other at Ariminum, under the consul Servilius. Hannibal determined to attack Flaminius first. In his march southward through the swamps of the basin of the Arnus, his army suffered greatly, and he himself lost the sight of one eye. After resting his troops for a short time in the neighbourhood of Faesulae, he marched past Arretium, ravaging the country as he went, with the view of drawing on Flaminius to a battle. Flaminius, who appears to have been a rash, headstrong man, hastily followed Hannibal; and, being attacked in the basin of Lake Trasimenus, was completely defeated by the Carthaginians, who were posted on the mountains which encircle the valley. Three or four days afterwards, Hannibal cut off a detachment of Roman cavalry, amounting to 4000 men, which had been sent by Servilius to assist his colleague. Hannible appears to have entertained hopes of overthrowing the Roman dominion, and to have expected that the other States of Italy would take up arms against Rome, in order to recover their independence. To win over the affections of the Italians, he dismissed without ransom all the prisoners whom he took in battle; and, to give them an opportunity of joining his army, he marched slowly along the eastern side of the peninsula, through Umbria and Picenum, into Apulia; but he did not meet with that co-operation which he appears to have expected. After the defeat of Flaminius, Q. Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator, and a defensive system of warfare was adopted by the Romans for the rest of the year.</p>
 <p>In the following year, B.C. 216, the Romans resolved upon another battle. An army of 80,000 
<pb n="768" /><cb />
 foot and 6000 horse was raised, which was commanded by the consuls L. Aemilius Paulus and C. Terentius Varro. The Carthaginian army now amounted to 40,000 foot and 10,000 horse. Both armies were encamped in the neighbourhood of Cannae in Apulia. In the battle which was fought near this place, the Romans were defeated with dreadful carnage, and with a loss which, as stated by Polybius, is quite incredible; the whole of the infantry engaged in battle, amounting to 70,000, was destroyed, with the exception of 3000 men, who escaped to the neighbouring cities, and also all the cavalry, with the exception of 300 belonging to the allies and 70 that escaped with Varro. A detachment of 10,000 foot, which had been sent to surprise the Carthaginian camp, was obliged to surrender as prisoners. The consul L. Aemilius and the two consuls of the former year, Servilius and Attilius, were also among the slain. Hannibal lost only 4000 Gauls, 1500 Africans and Spaniards, and 200 horse. This vietory placed the whole of Lower Italy in the power of Hannibal, but it was not followed by such important results as might have been expected. Capua and most of the cities of Campania espoused his cause, but the majority of the Italian States continued true to Rome. The defensive system was now strictly adopted by the Romans, and Hannibal was unable to make any active exertions for the further conquest of Italy till he received a reenforcement of troops. He was in hopes of obtaining support from Philip of Macedon and from the Syracusans, with both of whom he formed an alliance; but the Romans found means to keep Philip employed in Greece, and Syracuse was besieged and taken by Marcellus, B.C. 214-12. In addition to this, Capua was taken by the Romans, B.C. 211. Hannibal was therefore obliged to depend upon the Carthaginians for help, and Hasdrubal was accordingly ordered to march from Spain to his assistance. Gnaeus Scipio, as already observed, had been left in Spain to oppose Hasdrubal. He was afterwards joined by P. Cornelius Scipio, and the war was carried on with various success for many years, till at length the Roman army was entirely defeated by Hasdrubal, B.C. 212. Both the Scipios fell in the battle. Hasdrubal was now preparing to join his brother, but was prevented by the arrival of the young P. Cornelius Scipio in Spain, B.C. 210, who quickly recovered what the Romans had lost. In B.C. 210 he took Carthago Nova; and it was not till B.C. 207, when the Carthaginians had lost almost all their dominions in Spain, that Hasdrubal set out to join his brother in Italy. He crossed the Alps without meeting with any opposition from the Gauls, and arrived at Placentia before the Romans were aware that he had entered Italy. After besieging this town without success, he continued his march southward; but, before he could effect a junction with Hannibal, he was attacked by the consuls C. Claudius Nero and M. Livius, on the banks of the Metaurus in Umbria; his army was cut to pieces, and he himself fell in the battle. This misfortune obliged Hannibal to act on the defensive; and from this time till his departure from Italy in B.C. 203, he was confined to Bruttium; but, by his superior military skill, he maintained his army in a hostile country without any assistance from his government at home. After effecting the conquest of Spain, Scipio passed over into Africa to carry the <cb /> war into the enemy's country, B.C. 204. With the assistance of Masinissa, a Numidian prince, he gained two victories over the Carthaginians, who hastily recalled their great commander from Italy to defend his native State. Hannibal landed at Septis, and advanced upon Zama, five days' journey from Carthage towards the west. Here he was entirely defeated by Scipio, B.C. 202; 20,000 Carthaginians fell in the battle, and an equal number were taken prisoners. The Carthaginians were obliged to sue for peace, and thus ended the Second Punic War, B.C. 201. See <ref type="cross" target="crosszama-regia">Zama</ref>.</p>
 <p>After the conclusion of the war, Hannibal vigorously applied himself to correct the abuses which existed in the Carthaginian government. He reduced the power of the perpetual judges (as <bibl n="Liv.  23. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiii. 46</bibl>, calls them), and provided for the proper collection of the public revenue, which had been embezzled. He was supported by the people in these reforms; but he incurred the enmity of many powerful men, who represented to the Romans that he was endeavouring to persuade his countrymen to join Antiochus, king of Syria, in a war against them. A Roman embassy was consequently sent to Carthage to demand the punishment of Hannibal as a disturber of the public peace; and Hannibal, aware that he should not be able to resist his enemies supported by the Roman power, escaped from the city and sailed to Tyre. From Tyre he went to Ephesus to join Antiochus, B.C. 196, and contributed to fix him in his determination to make war against the Romans. If Hannibal's advice as to the conduct of the war had been followed, the result of the contest might have been different; but he was only employed in a subordinate command, and had no opportunity for the exertion of his great military talents. At the conclusion of this war Hannibal was obliged to seek refuge at the court of Prusias, king of Bithynia, where he remained about five years, and on one occasion obtained a victory over Eumenes, king of Pergamus. But the Romans appear to have been uneasy so long as their once formidable enemy was alive. An embassy was sent to demand him of Prusias, who, being afraid of offending the Romans, agreed to give him up. To avoid falling into the hands of his ungenerous enemies, Hannibal destroyed himself by poison at Nicomedia in Bithynia, B.C. 183, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.</p>
 <p>The personal character of Hannibal is known to us only from the events of his public life, and even these have not been recorded by any historian of his own country; yet we cannot read the history of these campaigns, even in the narrative of his enemies, without admiring his great abilities and courage. Polybius remarks: “How wonderful is it that in the course of sixteen years, during which he maintained the war in Italy, he should never once dismiss his army from the field, and yet be able, like a good governor, to keep in subjection so great a multitude, and to confine them within the bounds of their duty, so that they never mutinied against him nor quarrelled among themselves. Though his army was composed of people of various countries—of Africans, Spaniards, Gauls, Carthaginians, Italians, and Greeks—men who had different laws, different customs, and different languages, and, in a word, nothing among them that was common—yet, so dexterous was his management that, notwithstanding 
<pb n="769" /><cb />
 this great diversity, he forced all of them to acknowledge one authority, and to yield obedience to one command. And this, too, he accomplished in the midst of very varied fortune. How high as well as just an opinion must these things convey to us of his ability in war! It may be affirmed with confidence that if he had first tried his strength in the other parts of the world and had come last to attack the Romans, he could scarcely have failed in any part of his design” (Polyb. iii.; vii. 8, 9; xiv. 16; <bibl n="Liv.  21. 39" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxi. 39</bibl>; Nepos, <title>Hannibal</title>).</p>

<head orig="Harmodius">Harmodius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἁρμόδιος</foreign>). An Athenian who, together with <ref type="cross" target="crossaristogiton">Aristogīton</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀριστογείτων</foreign>), became the cause of the overthrow of the Pisistratidae. The names of Harmodius and Aristogiton were immortalized by the gratitude of the Athenians. Aristogiton was a citizen of the middle class; Harmodius a youth distinguished by the comeliness of his person. They were both perhaps remotely allied to one another by blood, and were united by ties of the closest intimacy. The youth had received an outrage from Hipparchus, which roused both the resentment and the fears of his friend, lest Hipparchus should abuse his power to repeat the insult. But Hipparchus, whose pride had been wounded by the conduct of Harmodius, contented himself with an affront aimed at the honour of his family. By his orders, the sister of Harmodius was invited to take part in a procession, as bearer of one of the sacred vessels. When, however, she presented herself in her festal dress, she was publicly rejected, and dismissed as unworthy of the honour. This insult stung Harmodius to the quick, and kindled the indignation of Aristogiton. They resolved to engage in the desperate enterprise of overthrowing the ruling dynasty. They communicated their plan to a few friends, who promised their assistance; but they hoped that, as soon as the first blow should be struck, they would be joined by numbers, who would joyfully seize the opportunity of recovering their freedom. The conspirators fixed on the festival of the Panathenaea as the most convenient season for effecting their purpose. This festival was celebrated with a procession, in which the citizens marched armed with spears and shields, and was the only occasion on which, in time of peace, they could assemble under arms without exciting suspicion. It was agreed that Harmodius and Aristogiton should give the signal by stabbing Hippias, while their friends kept off his guards, and that they should trust to the general disposition in favour of liberty for the further success of their undertaking. When the day came, the conspirators armed themselves with daggers, 
<pb n="770" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00770">
<head orig="Harmodius and Aristogiton. (Copies in the Naples Museum.)">Harmodius and Aristogiton. (Copies in the Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure>
 which they concealed in the myrtle-boughs that were carried on this occasion. But while Hippias, surrounded by his guards, was in the Ceramicus, directing the order of the procession, one of the conspirators was observed to go up to him, for he was easy of access to all, and to enter into familiar conversation with him. The two friends, on seeing this, concluded that they were betrayed, and that they had no hope left but of revenge. They instantly rushed into the city, and, meeting Hipparchus, killed him before his guards could come up to his assistance. These, however, arrived in time to avenge his death on Harmodius. Aristogiton escaped for the moment through the crowd, but was afterwards taken. When the news was brought to Hippias, instead of proceeding to the scene of his brother's murder, he advanced with a composed countenance towards the armed procession, which was yet ignorant of the event, and, as if he had some grave discourse to address to them, desired them to lay aside their weapons, and meet him at an appointed place. He then ordered his guards to seize the arms, and to search every one for those which he might have concealed upon his person. All who were found with daggers were arrested, together with those whom, on any other grounds, he suspected of disaffection. Aristogiton was put to death, according to some authors, after torture had been applied to wring from him the names of his accomplices. It is said that he avenged himself by accusing the truest friends of Hippias. The mistress of Aristogiton, one <ref type="cross" target="crossleaena">Leaena</ref> (q.v.), whose only crime was to have been the object of his affection, underwent the like treatment. She was afterwards celebrated for the constancy with which she endured the most cruel torments ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 55</bibl>; vii. 123; <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 20</bibl>; vi. 54 foll.). These events took place in B.C. 514.</p>
 <p>After the expulsion of Hippias the tyrannicides <cb /> received almost heroic honours. Statues were erected to them at the public expense, and their names never ceased to be repeated with affectionate admiration in the popular songs of Athens, which assigned them a place in the Islands of the Blessed, by the side of Achilles and Tydides; and when an orator wished to suggest the idea of the highest merit and of the noblest services to the cause of liberty, he never failed to remind his hearers of Harmodius and Aristogiton. No slave was ever called by their names. Plutarch has preserved a reply of Antipho , the orator, to Dionysius the elder, of Syracuse. The latter had asked the question, which was the finest kind of bronze? “That,” replied Antipho , “of which the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton were made.” He lost his life in consequence. Their statues, made by Antenor and set up in the Agora, were carried away by Xerxes when he took Athens in B.C. 480, but were restored by Alexander the Great.

At her marriage all the gods were present on the Acropolis of Thebes, and offered her their wedding-gifts. Cadmus gave her a costly garment and a necklace, the workmanship of Hephaestus, which he had received from Aphrodité, or (according to another account) from Europa. These gifts, so the story runs, had everywhere the fatal property of stirring up strife and bloodshed. It was with them that Polynices corrupted Eriphylé, who drove her husband Amphiaraüs to his destruction in the Theban War, and was murdered in revenge by her son Alcmaeon. It was for their sake that Alcmaeon and Phegeus and his sons were slain. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalcmaeon">Alcmaeon</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphegeus">Phegeus</ref>.)

 <p> An Etruscan soothsayer, whose function it was to interpret the divine will from the entrails of sacrificial victims, to propitiate the anger of the gods as indicated by lightning or other marvels, and to interpret their significance according to Etruscan formulae. This art had long been practised in Etruria, and was referred to a divine origin. In the course of the republican era it found a home in the private and public life of the Romans, winning its way as the native priesthoods, intrusted with similar functions, lost in repute. From the time of the kings to the end of the Republic, haruspices were expressly summoned from Etruria by decrees of the Senate on the occurrence of prodigies which were not provided for in the Pontifical and Sibylline Books. <cb /> Their business was to interpret the signs, to ascertain what deity demanded an expiation, and to indicate the nature of the necessary offering.</p>
 <p>It then lay with the priests of the Roman people to carry out their instructions. Their knowledge of the signs given by lightning was only applied in republican Rome for the purpose of averting the omen portended by the flash. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossputeal">Puteal</ref>.) But under the Empire it was also used for consulting the lightning, either keeping it off or drawing it down. From about the time of the Punic Wars, haruspices began to settle in Rome, and were employed both by private individuals and state officials to ascertain the divine will by examination of the liver, gall, heart, lungs, and caul of sacrificial victims. They were especially consulted by generals when going to war. Their science was generally held in high esteem, but the class of haruspices who took pay for their services did not enjoy so good a reputation. Claudius seems to have been the first emperor who instituted a regular <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> of Roman haruspices, consisting of sixty members of equestrian rank, and presided over by a <seg lang="la">haruspex maximus</seg>, for the regular service of the State. This <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> continued to exist till the beginning of the fifth century A.D.

<head orig="Hasdrŭbal">Hasdrubal</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσδρούβας</foreign>, meaning in Punic “(whose) help (is) Baal”). (1) A Carthaginian general, son of Mago, who succeeded to the titles and glory of his father. It was under his conduct that the Carthaginians carried the war into Sardinia. He received in that island a wound which caused his death, B.C. 420 ( <bibl n="Just.  19. 1" default="NO">Just.xix. 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) Son of the preceding, made war upon the Numidians, and freed Carthage from the tribute she had been compelled to pay for being permitted to establish herself on the coast of Africa ( <bibl n="Just.  19. 2" default="NO">Just.xix. 2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) A son of Hanno , sent into Sicily at the head of a powerful army to oppose the Romans. He was defeated by Metellus, the Roman proconsul, B.C. 251. Hasdrubal fled to Lilybaeum, but was condemned to death by his countrymen at home.</p>
 <p>(4) Son-in-law of Hamilcar, distinguished himself under the orders of that general in the war with Numidia. On the death of his father-in-law he was appointed commander, and carried on military operations in Spain during eight years. He reduced the greater part of that country, and governed it with wisdom and prudence. He founded Carthago Nova (Carthagena). The Romans, wishing to put a stop to his successes, made a treaty with Carthage, by which the latter bound herself not to carry her arms beyond the Iberus. Hasdrubal faithfully observed the terms of this compact. He was slain, B.C. 220, by a slave whose master he had put to death (<bibl n="Liv.  21. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxi. 2</bibl>; Polyb. ii. 1, 13, iii. 12, x. 10).</p>
 <p>(5) Son of Hamilcar, brought from Spain large reinforcements for his brother Hannibal. He crossed the barrier of the Alps, and arrived in Italy, but the consuls Livius Salinator and Claudius Nero, having intercepted the letters which he had written to Hannibal, informing him of his arrival, attacked him near the river Metaurus, and gave him a complete defeat, B.C. 208. Hasdrubal fell in the battle, with 56,000 of his troops. The Romans lost about 8000 men, and made 5400 prisoners. The head of Hasdrubal 
<pb n="773" /><cb />
 was severed from his body, and was thrown a few days afterwards into the camp of Hannibal. Before attempting to enter Italy by land, Hasdrubal attempted to cross the sea from Spain, but was defeated by the Roman governor of Sardinia (<bibl n="Liv.  21. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxi. 23</bibl>; Polyb. xi. 1).</p>
 <p>(6) A Carthaginian commander, son of Giscon, who commanded the forces of his country in Spain during the time of Hannibal. Being seconded by Syphax, he afterwards carried on the war against the Romans in Africa, but was defeated by Scipio. He died B.C. 206 (<bibl n="Liv.  24. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiv. 41</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  29. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxix. 35</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  30. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxx. 5</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(7) A Carthaginian, surnamed “the Kid” (<seg lang="la">haedus</seg>), an opponent of the Barca faction. He advised his countrymen to make peace with the Romans, and censured the ironical laugh of Hannibal in the Carthaginian Senate, after the peace was concluded.</p>
 <p>(8) A Carthaginian general, who, during the siege of Carthage by the Romans, commanded an army of 20,000 men without the walls, with which he kept constantly harassing the besiegers. Being compelled at last to take refuge with his forces within the city, he took command of the place, and for a long time bravely withstood the attacks of the Romans. After the capture of the city, he retired with the Roman deserters, who had no quarter to expect, into the temple of Aesculapius in the citadel, resolved to bury himself under its ruins, taking with him, at the same time, his wife and two young sons. At length, however, having secretly left the temple, he threw himself at the feet of Scipio, and supplicated for life. Scipio granted his request, and showed him as a suppliant to the deserters in the temple. These desperate men, after venting against him a torrent of reproaches, set fire to the temple, and perished amid the flames. His wife, when the fire was kindling, displayed herself on the walls of the building in the richest attire she could procure, and, having upbraided her husband for his cowardice, slew her two sons, and threw herself, with them, into the burning pile (Appian, <title>Bell. Pun.</title> 131).

(See <ref type="cross" target="crosslegio">Legio</ref>.) At length, however, the <seg lang="la">pilum</seg> was introduced for the whole infantry of the legion. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspilum">Pilum</ref>.) To deprive a soldier of his <seg lang="la">hasta</seg> was equivalent to degrading him to the rank of the <seg lang="la">velites</seg>, who were armed with javelins. A blunt hasta with a button at the end (<seg lang="la">hasta pura</seg>) continued to be used in later times as a military decoration. The spear frequently had a leathern thong tied to the middle of <cb /> the shaft, which was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀγκύλη</foreign> by the Greeks, and <seg lang="la">amentum</seg> or <hi rend="italic">ammentum</hi> by the Romans, and which was of assistance in throwing the spear.

The <seg lang="la">amentum</seg> added to the effect of throwing the lance by giving it rotation, and hence a greater degree of steadiness and directness in its course.</p>
 <p>The hasta was employed in many symbolical ceremonies. The <seg lang="la">fetialis</seg> (q. v.), for instance, hurled a blood-stained hasta into the enemy's territory as a token of declaration of war, and if a general devoted his life for his army he stood on a hasta while repeating the necessary formula. <figure id="fig.00773.2">
<head orig="Greek Warrior with Spears. (Hope.)">Greek Warrior with Spears. (Hope.)</head>

<div2 id="crosshecate" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hecăté">Hecate</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑκάτη</foreign>). A Greek goddess, though perhaps of non-Hellenic origin. She was unknown to Homer, but in Hesiod she was the only daughter of the Titan Perses and of Asteria, the sister of Leto. She stood high in the regard of Zeus, from whom she had received a share in the heaven, earth, and ocean. She was invoked at all sacrifices, for she could give or withhold her blessing in daily life, in war, in contests on the sea, in the hunting-field, in the education of children, and in the tending of cattle. Thus she appeared as a personification of the divine power, and was the instrument through which the gods effected their will, though themselves far away. In later times she was confused with Persephoné, the queen of the lower world, or associated with her. Sometimes she was regarded as the goddess of the moon (Selené) or as Artemis, sometimes she was identified with foreign deities of the same kind. Being conceived of as a goddess of night and of the lower world, she was, as time 
<pb n="775" /><cb />
 went on, transformed into a deity of ghosts and magic. She was represented as haunting crossways and graves, accompanied by the dogs of the Styx, with the spirits of the dead and troops of spectral forms in her train. She lent powerful aid to all magical incantations and witches' work. All enchanters and enchantresses were her disciples and <hi rend="italic">protégés;</hi> Medea, in particular, was regarded as her votary. She was worshipped in private and in public in many places—for instance, in Samothrace, Thessaly, Lemnos, Athens, and Aegina—and had a celebrated temple near Stratonicea in Caria. Her images were set up in the front of houses and by the road-side, with altars in front of them and a roof above them. On the last day of the month, which was sacred to her, offerings were made to her in the crossways of eggs, fish, and onions. The victims sacrificed to her were young dogs, black ewes, and honey.</p>
 <p>In works of art she is usually portrayed in three forms, represented by three statues standing back to back. Each form has its special attributes— torches, keys, daggers, snakes, and dogs. In the Gigantomachia of Pergamum she appears with a different weapon in her three right hands—a torch, a sword, and a lance.

<head orig="Hector">Hector</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἕκτωρ</foreign>). The son of Priam and Hecuba and the most valiant of all the Trojan chiefs that fought against the Greeks. He married Andromaché, daughter of Eëtion, by whom he became the father of Astyanax. Hector was appointed commander of all the Trojan forces, and for a long period proved the bulwark of his native city. He was not only the bravest and most powerful, but also the most amiable, of his countrymen, and particularly distinguished himself in his conflicts with Aiax, Diomedes, and many other of the most formidable leaders. The fates had decreed that Troy should never be destroyed as long as Hector lived. The Greeks, therefore, after the death of Patroclus, who had fallen by Hector's hand, made a powerful effort under the command of Achilles; and, by the intervention of Athené, who assumed the form of Deïphobus, and urged Hector to encounter the Grecian chief, contrary to the remonstrances of Priam and Hecuba, their effort was crowned with success. Hector fell, and his death accomplished the overthrow of his father's kingdom. The dead body of the Trojan warrior was attached to the chariot of Achilles, and 
<pb n="776" /><cb /> insultingly dragged away to the Grecian fleet; and thrice every day, for the space of twelve days, was it also dragged by the victor around the tomb of Patroclus ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22. 399" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxii. 399</bibl> foll.; xxiv. 14 foll.). During all this time the corpse of Hector was shielded from dogs and birds, and preserved from corruption, by the united care of Aphrodité and Apollo. The body was at last ransomed by Priam, who went in person for this purpose to the tent of Achilles. Splendid obsequies were rendered to the deceased, and with these the action of the <title>Iliad</title> terminates. Vergil makes Achilles to have dragged the corpse of Hector thrice round the walls of Troy ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 483" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>i. 483</bibl>). Homer, however, is silent on this point. According to the latter, Hector fled thrice round the city-walls before engaging with Achilles; and, after he was slain, his body was immediately attached to the car of the victor, and dragged away as stated above. The incident, therefore, alluded to by Vergil must have been borrowed from one of the Cyclic poets, or perhaps some tragic writer.

<div2 id="crosshecuba" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hecŭba">Hecuba</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑκάβη</foreign>). The daughter of Dymas, a Phrygian prince (or, according to others, of Cisseus, a Thracian king, while others, again, made her the daughter of the river-god Sangarius and Metopé). She was the second wife of Priam, king of Troy ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.12.6" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.12.6</bibl>), and bore him nineteen children ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24. 496" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiv. 496</bibl>), of whom the chief were Hector, Paris, Deïphobus, Helenus, Troïlus, Polites, Polydorus, Cassandra, Creüsa, and Polyxena. When she was pregnant with <ref type="cross" target="crossparis">Paris</ref> (q.v.), she dreamed that she brought into the world a burning torch, which reduced her husband's palace and all Troy to ashes. On her telling this dream to Priam, he sent for his son Aesacus, by a former wife Arisbé, the daughter of Merops, who had been reared and taught to interpret dreams by his grandfather. Aesacus declared that the child would be the ruin of his country, and recommended him to expose it. As soon as born, the babe was given to a servant to be left on Ida to perish; but the attempt proved a fruitless one, and the prediction of the soothsayer was fulfilled. After the ruin of Troy and the death of Priam, Hecuba fell to the lot of Odysseus, and embarked with the conquerors for Greece. The fleet, however, was detained off the coast of the Thracian Chersonese by the appearance of the spectre of Achilles on the summit of his tomb, demanding to be honoured with a new offering. Polyxena was, in consequence, torn from Hecuba and immolated by Neoptolemus on the grave of his father. The grief of the mother was increased by the sight of the dead body of her son Polydorus, washed upon the shore, who had been cruelly slain by Polymestor, king of Thrace, to whose care Priam had consigned him. Bent on revenge, Hecuba managed, by artifice, to get Polymestor and his two children in her power, and, by the aid of her fellow-captives, she effected the murder of his sons, and then put out the eyes of the father. This act drew upon her the vengeance of the Thracians: they assailed her with darts and showers of stones; and, in the act of biting a stone with impotent rage, she was suddenly metamorphosed into a dog (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 13. 429" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xiii. 429</bibl> foll.). Hyginus says that she threw herself into the sea ( <bibl n="Hyg.

<head orig="Helĕna">Helena</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλένη</foreign>). (1) The beautiful daughter of Zeus and Leda, the wife of Tyndareos of Sparta. She was sister of the Dioscuri and of Clytaemnestra. The post-Homeric story represented her as carried off, while still a maiden, by Theseus, to the Attic fortress of Aphidnae, where she bore him a daughter, Iphigenia. She was afterwards set free by her brothers, who took her back to Sparta. She was wooed by a number of suitors, and at length gave her hand to Menelaüs, by whom she became the mother of one child, Hermioné. In the absence of her husband she was seduced and carried away to Troy by Paris, the son of Priam, taking with her great treasures. This was the origin of the Trojan War. The Trojans, in spite of the calamity she had brought upon them, loved her for her beauty, and refused to restore her to her husband. She, however, lamented the folly of her youth, and yearned for her home, her husband, and her daughter. After the death of Paris she was wedded to Deïphobus, assisted the Greeks at the taking of Troy, and betrayed Deïphobus into Menelaüs's hands. With Menelaüs she finally returned to <cb /> <figure id="fig.00777.2">
<head orig="Helen and Paris. (Naples Museum.)">Helen and Paris. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> Sparta after eight years' wandering, and lived thenceforth with him in happiness and concord.</p>
 <p>According to another story, mainly current after the time of Stesichorus, Paris carried off to Troy not the real Helen, but a phantom of her created by Heré. The real Helen was wafted through the air by Hermes, and brought to King Proteus in Egypt, whence, after the destruction of Troy, she was taken home by Menelaüs. (See Herod. ii. 112-120.) After the death of Menelaüs she was, according to one story, driven from Sparta by her step-sons, and fled thereupon to Rhodes to her friend Polyxo, who hanged her on a tree. Another tradition represented her as living after death in wedlock with Achilles on the island of Lencé. She was worshipped as the goddess of beauty in a special sanctuary at Therapné in Laconia, where a festival was held in her honour. She was also invoked, like her brothers the Dioscuri, as a tutelary deity of sailors. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdioscuri">Dioscuri</ref>.)</p>
 <p>In the <title>Iliad</title>, Helen is apparently regarded as one who is not responsible for the ruin that she works, two passages seeming to imply that she was carried off by force (ii. 356 and 390). In the <title>Odyssey</title> she is also excused by the fact that she sins because a god has so willed it. (Cf. <title>Odyss.</title> xxiii. 222). Mr. Gladstone in his Homeric studies even regards her as not only a type of womanly loveliness, but of almost Christian penitence as well! The story of Helen has received a splendid setting in the genius of poets of every age. She is the most famous woman of all antiquity. In Goethe's <title>Faust</title> (pt. ii.) she is allegorically introduced as typifying the classical spirit of beauty. In English, see the <title>Hellenics</title> of Walter Savage Landor, Tennyson's <title>Dream of Fair Women</title>, and Andrew Lang's poem <title>Helen of Troy</title>, with the appended essay.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Flavia Iulia</hi>, commonly known in ecclesiastical history by the name of St. Helena, the first wife of Constantius Chlorus. She was born of obscure 
<pb n="778" /><cb />
 parents, in a village called Drepanum, in Bithynia, which was afterwards raised by her son Constantine to the rank of a city, under the name of Helenopolis. Her husband Constantius, on being made Caesar by Diocletian and Maximian (A.D. 292), repudiated Helena, and married Theodora, daughter of Maximian. Helena withdrew into retirement until her son Constantine, having become emperor, called his mother to court, and gave her the title of Augusta. He also supplied her with large sums of money, which she employed in building and endowing churches, and in relieving the poor. About A.D. 325 she set out on a pilgrimage to Palestine, and, having explored the site of Jerusalem, she thought that she had discovered the sepulchre of Jesus, and also the cross on which he died. With it she is said to have found the crosses of the two thieves, and to have learned which was the true one by the miracle it wrought in restoring to health a sick person to whose bedside it was carried. She built a church on the spot supposed to be that of the Holy Sepulchre, which has continued to be venerated by that name to the present day. She also built a church at Bethlehem, in honour of the nativity of the Saviour. From Palestine she rejoined her son at Nicomedia, in Bithynia, where she expired, in the year 327, at a very advanced age. She is numbered by the Roman Church among the saints, and her festival is August 18th.

<head orig="Helĕna">Helena</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλένη</foreign>). A deserted and rugged island in the Aegean, opposite to Thoricus, and extending from that parallel to Sunium. It received its name from the circumstance of Paris having landed on it, as was said, in company with Helen, when they were fleeing from Sparta (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

He was so chagrined, according to some, at having failed to obtain Helen in marriage after the death of Paris that he retired to Mount Ida, and was there, by the advice of Calchas, surprised and carried away to the Grecian camp by Odysseus. Among other predictions, Helenus declared that Troy could not be taken unless <ref type="cross" target="crossphiloctetes">Philoctetes</ref> (q.v.) could be prevailed to quit his retreat and repair to the siege. After the destruction of Troy, he, together with Andromaché, fell to the share of Pyrrhus, whose favour he conciliated by deterring him from sailing with the rest of the Greeks, who (as he foretold) would be exposed to a severe tempest on leaving the Trojan shore. Pyrrhus not only manifested his gratitude by giving him Andromaché in marriage, but nominated him as his successor in the kingdom of Epirus, to the exclusion of his own son Molossus, who did not ascend the throne until after the death of Helenus. A son named Cestrinus was the offspring of the union of Helenus with Andromaché ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 3. 294" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>iii. 294</bibl> foll.).

They were three in number—Lampetié, Phaëthusa, and Phoebé; or seven, according to Hyginus— Meropé, Helié, Aeglé, Lampetié, Phoebé, Aethria, and Dioxippé. They were so afflicted at the death of their brother Phaëthon (see <ref type="cross" target="crossphaethon">Phaëthon</ref>) that they were changed by the gods into poplars, and their tears into amber, on the banks of the river Po (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

 <p>(2) One of the chief cities of Achaia, situated on the shore of the Sinus Corinthiacus, near Bura ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 146" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 146</bibl>). It was celebrated for the temple and worship of Poseidon, thence called Heliconius. Here, also, the general meeting of the Ionians was convened, while yet in the possession of Aegialus, and the festival which then took place is supposed to have resembled that of the Panionia, which they instituted afterwards in Asia Minor (Pausan. vii. 24). A tremendous influx of the sea, caused by a violent earthquake, overwhelmed and completely destroyed Helicé two years before the battle of Leuctra, B.C. 373. The details of this catastrophe will be found in Pausanias (vii. 24) and Aelian (<title>Hist. Anim.</title> xi. 19). Eratosthenes, as Strabo reports, beheld the site of this ancient city, and he was assured by sailors that the bronze statue of Poseidon was still visible beneath the waters, holding an hippocampus, or sea-horse, in his hand, and that it formed a dangerous shoal for their vessels. Two thousand workmen were afterwards sent by the Achaeans to recover the dead bodies, but without success.

<div2 id="crosshelicon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Helĭcon">Helicon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλικών</foreign>). (1) A famous mountain in Boeotia, near the Gulf of Corinth. It was sacred to Apollo and the Muses, who were thence called Heliconiades. This mountain was famed for the purity of its air, the abundance of its water, its fertile valleys, the density of its shades, and the beauty of the venerable trees which clothed its sides. On the summit was the grove of the Muses, where these divinities had their statues, and where also were statues of Apollo and Hermes, of Bacchus by Lysippus, of Orpheus, and of famous poets and musicians (Pausan. ix. 30). A little below the grove was the fountain of Aganippé. The source <ref type="cross" target="crosshippocrene">Hippocrené</ref> (q.v.) was about twenty stadia above the grove. It is said to have burst forth when the horse Pegasus struck his hoof into the ground (Pausan. ix. 31), whence its name, <foreign lang="greek">ἵππου κρήνη</foreign>. These two springs supplied two small rivers named Olmius and Permessus, which, after uniting their waters, flowed into the lake Copa ïs, near Haliartus. The modern name of Helicon is Palaeovouni, and of Hippocrené, Kryopēgadi, or “cold spring.”</p>

<div2 id="crossheliodorus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Heliodōrus">Heliodorus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡλιόδωρος</foreign>). (1) A Greek poet, from whom sixteen hexameters are cited by Stobaeus (<title>Serm.</title> 98), containing a description of that part of Campania situated between the Lucrine Lake and Puteoli, and where Cicero had a country residence. Some suppose him to have been the same with the rhetorician Heliodorus mentioned by Horace ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5. 2" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5. 2</bibl>), as one of the companions of his journey to Brundisium.</p>
 <p>(2) An Athenian physician, of whom Galen makes mention, and who also wrote a didactic poem, under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Ἀπολυτικά</foreign>, “Justification,” of which Galen cites seven hexameters.</p>
 <p>(3) A native of Larissa, who left a treatise on optics, under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Κεφάλαια τῶν Ὀπτικῶν</foreign>, which is scarcely anything more than an abridgment of the optical work ascribed to Euclid. He cites the optics of Ptolemy. The time when he flourished is uncertain; from the manner, however, in which he speaks of Tiberius, it is probable that he lived a long time after that emperor. Oribasius has preserved for us a fragment of another work of Heliodorus, which treats of the <foreign lang="greek">κοχλίας</foreign>, a machine furnished with a screw for drawing water.</p>
 <p>(4) A Greek romance-writer, who was born at Emesa in Phoenicia, and flourished under the emperors Theodosius and Arcadius at the close of the fourth century. He was raised to the dignity of a bishop of Tricca in Thessaly. Heliodorus is best known as the author of a Greek romance, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Αἰθιοπικά</foreign>, being the history of Theagenes and Chariclea, the latter a daughter of a king of Aethiopia. It is in ten books. This work was unknown in the West until a soldier of Anspach, under the Margrave Casimir of Brandenburg, assisting at the pillage of the library of Matthias Corvinus, at Buda, in 1526, being attracted by the rich binding of a manuscript, carried it off. He sold the prize afterwards to Vincent Obsopaeus, who published it at Basle in 1534. This was the celebrated romance of Heliodorus. Poetry, battles, piracies, and recognitions fill up the piece; there is no picture of the mind, no attempt at character-drawing carried on with the development of the action. The incidents point to no particular era of society, although one may perceive, from the tone of sentiment throughout, that the struggle had commenced between the spirit of Christianity and the grossness of pagan idolatry. Egypt is neither ancient Egypt, nor the Egypt of the Ptolemies, nor the Egypt of the Romans. Athens is neither Athens free nor Athens conquered—in short, there is no individuality either in the places or persons; and the vague pictures of the French romances of the seventeenth century give scarcely a caricatured idea of the model from which they were drawn. Various editions have been published of the romance of Heliodorus. The best are those of Bekker <bibl default="NO">(1855)</bibl> and Hirschig, in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Erotici Scriptores</title> (1856)</bibl>.

<head orig="Heliopŏlis">Heliopolis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡλιούπολις</foreign>). (1) A famous city of Egypt, situated a little to the east of the apex <cb /> of the Delta, not far from modern Cairo. In Hebrew it is styled On or Aun. In the Septuagint it is called Heliopolis, or City of the Sun; in Jeremiah (xliii. 13), Beth Shemim—i. e. <seg lang="la">domus solis.</seg> Herodotus also mentions it by this name, and speaks of its inhabitants as being the wisest and most ingenious of all the Egyptians (ii. 3). According to Berosus, this was the city of Moses. It was also a place of resort for all the Greeks who visited Egypt for instruction. Hither came Herodotus, Plato, Eudoxus, and others, and secured much of the learning which they afterwards disseminated among their own countrymen. Plato, in particular, resided here three years. <ref type="cross" target="crossmanetho">Manetho</ref> (q.v.), the historian, was also here as a priest. The city was built, according to Strabo, on a long, artificial mound of earth, so as to be out of reach of the inundations of the Nile. It had an oracle of Apollo and a famous Temple of the Sun. In this temple was fed and adored the sacred ox Mnevis, as Apis was at Memphis. This city was laid waste with fire and sword by Cambyses, and its chapter of priests all slaughtered. Strabo saw it in a deserted state and shorn of all its splendour. Heliopolis was famed also for its fountain of excellent water, which still remains, and gave rise to the subsequent Arabic name of the place, Ain Shems, or the Fountain of the Sun. The modern name is Matareieh, or cool water. A solitary obelisk of red granite is all that remains at the present day of this once celebrated place; and the two obelisks known as “Cleopatra 's Needles” were originally brought from Heliopolis to Alexandria. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandria">Alexandria</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) A celebrated city of Syria, thirty-five miles northwest of Damascus, and southwest of Emesa, on the opposite side of the Orontes. Its Grecian name, Heliopolis (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡλιούπολις</foreign>), “City of the Sun,” is merely a translation of the native term Baalbek, which appellation the ruins at the present day retain. [See illustration on the following page.] Heliopolis was famed for its Temple of the Sun (Baal), erected by Antoninus Pius, though by the natives now ascribed to Solomon; and the ruins of this celebrated pile still attest its former magnificence. Of these the most notable are the Great Temple, a rectangular building 200 feet by 162, with a peristyle of 54 Corinthian columns; a smaller temple called the Temple of Iupiter; and a circular building of fine proportions long used as a Greek Church. Heliopolis was made a Roman colony by Iulius Caesar, and was garrisoned under Augustus. Later it was pillaged by the Arabs and by Timur <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1400)</bibl>, and since that time has gradually decayed. It is now only a wretched hamlet of a few hundred inhabitants.

<div2 id="crosshelios" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Helios">Helios</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἥλιος</foreign>). In Greek mythology, the Sungod, son of the Titan Hyperion (whose name he bears in Homer) and the Titaness Thea; brother of Selené (the Moon) and Eos (Dawn). The poets apply the name Titan to him in particular, as the offspring of Titans. He is-represented as a strong and beautiful god, in the bloom of youth, with gleaming eyes and waving locks, and a crown of rays upon his head. In the morning he rises from a lovely bay of the Ocean in the farthest East, where the Æthiopians dwell. To give light to gods and men he climbs the vault of heaven in a chariot drawn by four snow-white horses, breathing 
<pb n="780" /><cb /> light and fire; their names are Eoös, Aethiops, Bronté, and Steropé. In the evening he sinks with his chariot into the Ocean, and while he sleeps is carried round along the northern border of the earth to the East again in a golden boat, <figure id="fig.00780">
<head orig="Temple at Heliopolis.">Temple at Heliopolis.</head>
</figure> shaped like a bowl, the work of Hephaestus. He is called Phaëthon, from the brilliant light that he diffuses; he is the All-seer (Panoptes), because his rays penetrate everywhere. He is revealer of all that is done on earth; it is he who told Hephaestus of the intrigue of Ares and Aphrodité, and showed Demeter who had carried off her daughter. He was accordingly invoked as a witness to oaths and solemn protestations.</p>
 <p>On the island of Trinacria (Sicily) he had seven flocks of sheep and seven herds of cattle, fifty in each. It was his pleasure, on his daily journey, to look down upon them. Their numbers were not to be increased or diminished; for if this was done, his wrath was terrible. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossodysseus">Odysseus</ref>.) In the 700 sheep and oxen the ancients recognized the 700 days and nights of the lunar year. The flocks were tended by Phaëthusa (the goddess of light) and Lampetié (the goddess of shining), his daughter by Neaera. By the ocean Nymph Persé or Perseïs he was father of Aeëtes, Circé, and Pasiphaë, by Clymené the father of Phaëthon, and Augeas was also accounted his son. His children had the gleaming eyes of their father.</p>
 <p>After the time of Euripides, or thereabouts, the all-seeing Sun-god was identified with Apollo, the god of prophecy. Helios was worshipped in many <cb /> places, among which may be mentioned Corinth and Elis. The island of Rhodes was entirely consecrated to him. Here an annual festival (<foreign lang="greek">Ἅλια</foreign>) was held during the summer in his honour, with chariot-racing and contests of music and gymnastics; and four consecrated horses were thrown into the sea as a sacrifice to him. In B.C. 278 a colossal bronze statue by Chares of Lindus was erected to him at the entrance of the harbour of Rhodes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolossus">Colossus</ref>.) Herds of red and white cattle were, in many places, kept in his honour. White animals, and especially white horses, were sacred to him; among the birds the cock, and among trees the white poplar. See, in English literature, the poem by Keats, <title>Hyperion</title>, and the first book of W. S. Landor's <title>Gebir.</title></p>
 <p>The Latin poets identified Helios with the Sabine deity Sol, who had an ancient place of worship on the Quirinal at Rome, and a public sacrifice on the 8th of August; but it was the introduction of the ritual of Mithras which first brought the worship of the sun into prominence in Rome.

He is said to have lived till the age of eighty-five, and to have gone on writing until after B.C. 406.

<div2 id="crosshellas" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hellas">Hellas</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλάς</foreign>). A name originally given to a district and city of Thessaly in the division Phthiotis ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 684" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>ii. 684</bibl>), then further extended to the whole of Thessaly, and finally adopted as a general appellation for all Greece. Hellas is a peninsula, the easternmost of the three that project from the south of Europe into the Mediterranean Sea. Its western coast is rough and mountainous, while its eastern shores abound in gulfs, bays, and harbours. From this geographical cause Greece for a long time knew little or nothing of Italy and the West, but sustained very close relations, political and commercial, with the countries of Asia Minor —a fact of immense importance in her historical development. Because of her long line of coast, she first received, in great measure, the quickening which comes from immigration and the contact with new ideas that inevitably follows; so that Greece, largely by reason of her physical conformation and position, most readily responded to the influences of oriental culture, and thus became the cradle of European civilization.</p>
 <p>Hellas is divided into two parts by the Gulf of Corinth, which would have completely severed them were it not for the narrow Isthmus of Corinth. This, until it was cut by the modern canal <bibl default="NO">(August, 1893)</bibl>, united the southern division (Peloponnesus) with the northern (Hellas Proper). Hellas as a whole is marked off from the rest of Europe by a mountain chain, an extension of the Balkans, known in ancient times as the Haemus. From this range ran the chains from north-northwest to south-southeast, which form the skeleton of Greece. What may be called the backbone of the country is the range that first separates Illyria from Macedonia and Epirus from Thessaly, and then continues down through the whole peninsula. The most important single chain is Pindus (7111 feet), with its branch Othrys. Various single peaks are Olympus in Thessaly (9750 feet), Ossa, Pelion, Tymphrestus (7606 feet), Parnassus (8036 feet), and Helicon, all in Hellas Proper; with Cyllené, Aroania, and Erymanthus in the Peloponnesus, whose two important spurs are the Taÿgetus and Parnon. The Ionian Isles, Corcyra, Cephallenia, Leucas, and Zacynthus, off the western coast, follow the same direction as the mountain chains of the Peloponnesus and the mainland.</p>
 <p>The rivers of Greece are small streams, little more than brooks, flowing usually south or west. In Hellas Proper there are four principal rivers, all having their source on Mount Lacmon of the Pindus range. The Aoüs flows into the Adriatic, the Peneus and Haliacmon into the Thermaic Gulf, and the Acheloüs into the Gulf of Patrae. In the Peloponnesus, the important streams rise near the north of Taÿgetus, the Eurotas flowing south and the Alpheus west.</p>
 <p>The Hellenes were a branch of the family to which most of the European peoples belong, and which is variously described as Aryan, Indo-Germanic, and Indo-European, whose original home is <cb /> uncertain, being by some placed in Asia and by others in Europe. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.) It is generally held, however, that the original inhabitants of Greece entered it from the north at a very remote period, probably during the Stone Age; that they were in the nomadic stage of development; and that they came on in successive waves of immigration, each of which pushed farther south the people who had already preceded it. Even after the whole of Hellas had been covered by these early tribes, succeeding waves followed, overspreading the territory occupied by others. Such a wave of later immigration was that which is known to the legendary historians as “the return of the Heraclidae.” (See <ref type="cross" target="crossheraclidae">Heraclidae</ref>.) This pressure from behind had the effect of driving out many who had settled in the mainland into the adjacent islands, and ultimately to far distant lands, such as the coasts of Asia Minor, Sicily, the shore of the Euxine, and the north of Africa. Hellas in its wider sense is, therefore, to be understood of the united settlements of Hellenes in all parts of the then known world, and it was in this sense that the Hellenes themselves understood it, since to them the word always had an ethnic rather than a territorial significance. The name <foreign lang="greek">Ἕλληνες</foreign> in Homer refers only to the Thessalian people mentioned above; and in fact the Homeric poems have no general designation for the Greeks as a whole. They are called Danaï (<foreign lang="greek">Δαναοί</foreign>), Argivi (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀργεῖοι</foreign>), and Achaei (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαιοί</foreign>), and it was not much before the time of Herodotus, Thucydides, and Scylax that the terms <foreign lang="greek">Ἑλλάς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ἕλληνες</foreign> received their full extension of meaning. The Orientals spoke of the Greeks as “Ionians”; the Italians called them Graeci, from one of the ancient tribes of Epirus, the <foreign lang="greek">Γραικοί</foreign>—a word older than <foreign lang="greek">Ἕλληνες</foreign>, but disused and then revived by Sophocles, according to Eustathius (<seg lang="la">ad</seg>  Hom. <title>Il.</title>p. 890<bibl n="Hom.

 <p>The time which elapsed from the appearance of the Hellenes in Thessaly to the siege of Troy is usually known by the name of the Heroic Age. Thucydides informs us (i. 4) that the commencement of Grecian civilization is to be dated from the reign of Minos of Crete, who acquired a naval power and cleared the Aegean Sea of pirates. Among the most celebrated heroes of this period were Bellerophon and Perseus, whose adventures were laid in the East; Theseus, the king of Athens; and Heracles. Tradition also preserved the account of expeditions undertaken by several chiefs united together, such as that of the Argonauts, of the Seven against Thebes, and of the siege of Troy. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.</p>
 <p>It is learned from Thucydides (i. 12) that the population of Greece was in a very unsettled state for some time after the Trojan War. Of the various migrations which appear to have taken place, the most important in their consequences were those of the Boeotians from Thessaly into the country afterwards called Boeotia, and of the Dorians into Peloponnesus. At about the same period the western 
<pb n="782" /><cb /> coast of Asia Minor was colonized by the Greeks. The ancient inhabitants of Boeotia, who had been driven out of their homes by the invasion of the Boeotians, together with some Aeolians (whence it has acquired the name of the Aeolian migration) left Boeotia and settled in Lesbos and the northwestern corner of Asia Minor. They were not long afterwards followed by the Ionians, who, having been driven from their abode on the Corinthian Gulf, had taken refuge in Attica, whence they emigrated to Asia Minor and settled on the Lydian coast. The southwestern part of the coast of Asia Minor was also colonized at about the same period by Dorians. The number of Greek colonies, considering the extent of the mother country, was very great; and the readiness with which the Greeks left their homes to settle in foreign lands forms a remarkable feature of their national character. In the seventh century before Christ the Greek colonies took another direction: Cyrené, in Africa, was founded by the inhabitants of Thera, and the coasts of Sicily and the southern <figure id="fig.00782">
<head orig="Map of Ancient Greece.">Map of Ancient Greece.</head>
</figure> <cb /> part of Italy became studded with so many Greek cities that it acquired the name of the Great, or Greater, Greece (Magna Graecia). (On the settlement of the Greek cities in Southern Italy, see Lenormant, <title>La Grande Grèce</title>, 3 vols. [Paris, 1881].)</p>
 <p>The two States of Greece which attained the greatest historical celebrity were Sparta and Athens. The power of Athens was of later growth; but Sparta had, from the time of the Dorian conquest, taken the lead among the Peloponnesian States, a position which she maintained by the conquest of the fertile country of Messenia, B.C. 688. Her superiority was probably owing to the nature of her political institutions, which are said to have been fixed on a firm basis by her celebrated lawgiver Lycurgus, B.C. 884. At the head of the nation were two hereditary kings, but their power was greatly limited by a jealous aristocracy. Her territories were also increased by the conquest of Tegea in Arcadia. Athens rose to importance only in the century preceding the Persian Wars; but even in this period her power was 
<pb n="783" /><cb />
 not more than a match for the little States of Megaris and Aegina. The city was long harassed by internal commotions till the time of Solon, B.C. 594, who was chosen by his fellow-citizens to frame a new constitution and a new code of laws, to which much of the future greatness of Athens must be ascribed. We have already seen that the kingly form of government was prevalent in the Heroic Age. But, during the period that elapsed between the Trojan War and the Persian invasion, hereditary political power was abolished in almost all the Greek States, with the exception of Sparta, and a republican form of government established in its stead. In studying the history of the Greeks, one must bear in mind that almost every city formed an independent State, and that, with the exception of Athens and Sparta, which exacted obedience from the other towns of Attica and Laconia respectively, there was hardly any State which possessed more than a few miles of territory. Frequent wars between themselves were the almost unavoidable consequence of the existence of so many small States nearly equal in power. The evils which arose from this condition of things were partly remedied by the influence of the Amphictyonic Council and by the religious games and festivals which were held at fixed periods in different parts of Greece, and during the celebration of which no wars were carried on. In the sixth century before the Christian era, Greece rapidly advanced in knowledge and civilization. Literature and the fine arts were already cultivated in Athens under the anspices of Pisistratus and his sons; and the products of remote countries were introduced into Greece by the merchants of Corinth and Aegina. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscommerce">Commerce</ref>.</p>
 <p>This was the most splendid period of Grecian history. The Greeks, in their resistance to the Persians, and the part they took in the burning of Sardis, B.C. 499, drew upon them the vengeance of Darius. After the reduction of the Asiatic Greeks, a Persian army was sent into Attica, but was entirely defeated at Marathon, B.C. 490, by the Athenians under Miltiades. Ten years afterwards the whole power of the Persian Empire was directed against Greece; an immense army, led in person by Xerxes, advanced as far as Attica, and received the submission of almost all the Grecian States, with the exception of Athens and Sparta. But this expedition also failed; the Persian fleet was destroyed in the battles of Artemisium and Salamis; and the land forces were entirely defeated in the following year, B.C. 479, at Plataea in Boeotia. Sparta had, previous to the Persian invasion, been regarded by the other Greeks as the first power in Greece, and accordingly she obtained the supreme command of the army and fleet in the Persian War. But, during the course of this war, the Athenians had made greater sacrifices and had shown a greater degree of courage and patriotism, so that after the battle of Plataea a confederacy was formed by the Grecian States for carrying on the war against the Persians. Sparta was at first placed at the head of it; but the allies, disgusted with the tyranny of <ref type="cross" target="crosspausanias">Pausanias</ref> (q.v.), the Spartan commander, gave the supremacy to Athens. The allies, who consisted of the inhabitants of the islands and coasts of the Aegean Sea, were to furnish contributions in money and ships, and the delicate task of assessing the amount which each State was to pay was assigned to Aristides. The yearly contribution <cb /> was settled at 460 talents (about $542,800), and Delos was chosen as the common treasury. The Athenians, under the command of Cimon, carried on the war vigorously, defeated the Persian fleets, and plundered the maritime provinces of the Persian Empire.</p>
 <p>During this period the power of Athens rapidly increased; she possessed a succession of distinguished statesmen—Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon, and Pericles—who all contributed to the advancement of her power, though differing in their political views. Her maritime greatness was founded by Themistocles, her revenues were increased by Pericles, and her general prosperity, in connection with other causes, tended to produce a greater degree of culture than existed in any other part of Greece. Literature was cultivated, and the arts of architecture and sculpture, which were employed to ornament the city, were carried to a degree of excellence that has never since been surpassed. See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>.</p>
 <p>While Athens was advancing in power, Sparta had to maintain a war against the Messenians, who again revolted, and were joined by a great number of the Spartan slaves (B.C. 461-455). But, though Sparta made no efforts during this period to restrain the Athenian power, it was not because she wanted the will, but the means. These, however, were soon furnished by the Athenians themselves, who began to treat the allied States with great tyranny, and to regard them as subjects, and not as independent States in alliance. The tribute was raised from 460 to 600 talents, the treasury was removed from Delos to Athens, and the decision of all important suits was referred to the Athenian courts. When any State withdrew from the alliance, its citizens were considered by the Athenians as rebels, and immediately reduced to subjection. The dependent States, anxious to throw off the Athenian dominion, entreated the assistance of Sparta, and thus, in conjunction with other causes, arose the war between Sparta and Athens, which lasted for twenty-seven years (B.C. 431-404), and is usually known as the <ref type="cross" target="crosspeloponnesian-war">Peloponnesian War</ref> (q.v.). It terminated by again placing Sparta at the head of all Greece. Soon after the conclusion of this war, Sparta engaged in a contest with the Persian Empire, which lasted from B.C. 400 to 394. The splendid successes which Agesilaüs, the Spartan king, obtained over the Persian troops in Asia Minor, and the manifest weakness of the Persian Empire, which had been already shown by the successful retreat of only ten thousand Greeks from the very heart of the Persian Empire (see <ref type="cross" target="crossxenophon">Xenophon</ref>), appear to have induced Agesilaüs to entertain the design of overthrowing the Persian monarchy; but he was obliged to return to his native country to defend it against a powerful confederacy, which had been formed by the Corinthians, Thebans, Argives, Athenians, and Thessalians, for the purpose of throwing off the Spartan dominion. The confederates were not, however, successful in their attempt; and the Spartan supremacy was again secured for a brief period by a general peace, made B.C. 387, usually known by the name of the peace of Antalcidas. Ten years afterwards, the rupture between Thebes and Sparta began, which led to a general war in Greece, and for a short time gave Thebes the hegemony of Hellas. The greatness of Thebes was principally owing to the wisdom and valour of two of 
<pb n="784" /><cb />
 her sons—Pelopidas and Epaminondas. After the death of Epaminondas at the battle of Mantinea, B.C. 362, Thebes again sank to its former obscurity. The Spartan supremacy was, however, wholly destroyed, and her power still further humbled by the restoration of Messenia to independence, B.C. 369. From the conclusion of this war to the reign of Philip of Macedon, Greece remained without any ruling power. It is only necessary here to mention the part which Philip took in the Sacred War (q. v.), which lasted ten years (B.C. 356-346), in which he appeared as the defender of the Amphictyonic Council, and which terminated by the conquest of the Phocians. The Athenians, urged on by Demosthenes, made an alliance with the Thebans for the purpose of resisting Philip; but their defeat at Chaeronea, B.C. 388, secured for the Macedonian king the supremacy of Greece. In the same year a congress of Grecian States was <figure id="fig.00784">
<head orig="Country about Athens. (From the painting by A. de Curzon.)">Country about Athens. (From the painting by A. de Curzon.)</head>
</figure> held at Corinth, in which Philip was chosen general-in-chief of the Greeks in a projected war against the Persian Empire; but his assassination in B.C. 336 caused this enterprise to devolve on his son Alexander. See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexander">Alexander</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmacedonia">Macedonia</ref>.</p>
 <p>The conquests of Alexander extended the Grecian influence over the greater part of Asia west of the Indus. After his death the dominion of the East was contested by his generals, and two powerful empires were permanently established—that of the Ptolemies in Egypt and the Seleucidae in Syria. The dominions of the early Syrian kings embraced the greater part of Western Asia; but their Empire was soon divided into various independent kingdoms, such as that of Bactria and Pergamus, in all of which the Greek language was spoken, not merely at court, but to a considerable extent in the cities. From the death of Alexander to the Roman conquest, Macedon remained the <cb /> ruling power in Greece. The Aetolian and Achaean leagues were formed, the former B.C. 284, the latter B.C. 281, for the purpose of resisting the Macedonian kings. Macedonia was conquered by the Romans B.C. 197, and the Greek States declared independent. This, however, was merely nominal; for they only exchanged the rule of the Macedonian kings for that of the Roman people; and in B.C. 146, Greece was reduced to the form of a Roman province, called Achaea, though certain cities, such as Athens, Delphi, and others, were allowed to have the rank of free towns. The history of Greece, from this period, forms part of that of the Roman Empire. See <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Roma</ref>.</p>
 <p>Greece was overrun by the Goths in A.D. 267, and again in A.D. 398, under Alaric; and, after being occupied by the Crusaders and Venetians, at last fell into the hands of the Turks, on the conquest of Constantinople; from whom it was again liberated in 1828.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Εἱλῶται</foreign>), and <hi rend="bold">Helōtes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Εἵλωτες</foreign>). The Helots or bondsmen of the Spartans. The common account of the origin of this class is, that the inhabitants of the maritime town of Helos were reduced by Sparta to this state of degradation, after an insurrection against the Dorians already established in power. This explanation, however, rests merely on an etymology, and that by no means probable. The word <foreign lang="greek">Εἵλως</foreign> is probably a derivative from <foreign lang="greek">ἑλεῖν</foreign> in a passive sense, and consequently means “a prisoner”—a derivation known in ancient times. It seems likely that they were an aboriginal race, which was subdued at a very early period, and which immediately passed over as slaves to the Doric conquerors. In speaking of the condition of the Helots, their political rights and their personal treatment will be considered under different heads, though in fact the two subjects are very nearly connected.</p>
 <p>The first were doubtless exactly defined by law and custom, though the expressions made use of by ancient authors are frequently vague and ambiguous. “They were,” says Ephorus, “in a certain point of view public slaves. Their possessor could neither liberate them nor sell them beyond the borders.” From this it is evident that they were considered as belonging properly to the State, which to a certain degree permitted them to be possessed by individuals, reserving to itself the power of enfranchising them. But to sell them out of the country was not in the power even of the State; and such an event seems never to have occurred. It is, upon the whole, most probable that individuals had no power to sell them at all, as they belonged chiefly to the landed property, and this was inalienable. On these lands they had certain fixed dwellings of their own, and particular services and payments were prescribed to them. They paid as rent a fixed measure of corn; not, however, like the Perioeci, to the State, but to their masters. As this quantity had been definitely settled at a very early period, the Helots were the persons who profited by a good, and lost by a bad, harvest, which must have been to them an encouragement 
<pb n="786" /><cb /> to industry and good husbandry, as would not have been the case if the profit and loss had merely affected the landlords. In fact, by this means, as is proved by the accounts respecting the Spartan agriculture, a careful cultivation of the soil was kept up. By means of the rich produce of the lands, and in part by plunder obtained in war, they collected a considerable property, to the attainment of which almost every access was closed to the Spartans. The cultivation of the land, however, was not the only duty of the Helots; they also, at the public meals, attended upon their masters, who, according to the Lacedaemonian principle of a community of property, mutually lent them to one another ( <title>Rep. Lac.</title> vi. 3; Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>ii. 2</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> Pol., 5</bibl>). A large number of them was also employed by the State in public works. In the field the Helots never served as hoplites, except in extraordinary cases; and then it was the general practice afterwards to give them their liberty. This seems first to have occurred under Brasidas in B.C. 424. (Cf. Thuc. iv. 80, vii. 19.) On other occasions they attended the regular army as light-armed troops (<foreign lang="greek">ψιλοί</foreign>); and that their numbers were very considerable may be seen from the battle of Plataea, in which 5000 Spartans were attended by 35,000 Helots. Although they did not share the honour of the heavy-armed soldiers, they were in turn exposed to a less degree of danger; for, while the former, in close rank, received the onset of the enemy with spear and shield, the Helots, armed only with their slings and javelins, were in a moment either before or behind the ranks, as Tyrtaeus accurately describes the relative duties of the light-armed soldier (<foreign lang="greek">γυμνής</foreign>) and the hoplite. Sparta, in her better days, is never recorded to have unnecessarily sacrificed the lives of her Helots. A certain number of them were allotted to each Spartan ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 28</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc.  3. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iii. 8</bibl>). At the battle of Plataea this number was seven. Those who were assigned to a single master were probably called <foreign lang="greek">ἀμπίτταρες</foreign>. Of these, however, one in particular was the servant (<foreign lang="greek">θεράπων</foreign>) of his master, as in the story of the blind Spartan, who was conducted by his Helot into the thickest of the battle of Thermopylae, and, while the latter fled, fell with the other heroes ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 229" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 229</bibl>). It appears that the other Helots were in the field placed more immediately under the command of the king than the rest of the army ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 80</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  81" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 81</bibl>). In the fleet they composed the large mass of the sailors ( <title>Hist. Gr.</title> vii. 1, 12), in which service at Athens the inferior citizens and slaves were employed. It is a matter of much greater difficulty to form a clear notion of the treatment of the Helots, and of their manner of life; for the rhetorical spirit with which later historians have embellished their views has been productive of much confusion and misconception. Myron of Priené, in his account of the Messenian War, drew a very dark picture of Sparta, and endeavoured at the end to rouse the feelings of his readers by a description of the fate which the conquered underwènt. “The Helots,” says he, “perform for the Spartans every ignominious service. They are compelled to wear a cap of dog's skin (<foreign lang="greek">κυνῆ</foreign>), to have a covering of sheep's skin (<foreign lang="greek">διφθέρα</foreign>), and are severely beaten every year without having committed any fault, in order that they may never forget they are slaves. In addition to this, those among them who, either by their stature or their <cb /> beauty, raise themselves above the condition of a slave, are condemned to death, and the masters who do not destroy the most manly of them are liable to punishment.” Myron's statements, however, are to be received with considerable caution.</p>
 <p>Plutarch relates (<title>Lycurg.</title> 28) that the Helots were compelled to intoxicate themselves, and to perform indecent dances, as a warning to the Spartan youth. Yet Helot women discharged the office of nurse in the royal palaces, and doubtless obtained the affection with which the attendants of early youth were honoured in ancient times. It is, however, certain that the Doric laws did not bind servants to strict temperance; and hence examples of drunkenness among them might well have served as a means of recommending sobriety. It was also an established regulation that the national songs and dances of Sparta were forbidden to the Helots, who, on the other hand, had some extravagant and lascivious dances peculiar to themselves, which may have given rise to the above report.</p>
 <p>It was the curse of this bondage, which Plato terms the hardest in Greece, that the slaves abandoned their masters when they stood in greatest need of their assistance; and hence the Spartans were even compelled to stipulate in treaties for aid against their own subjects ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 118" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 118</bibl><bibl n="Thuc.  5. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc., v. 14</bibl>; cf. Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>ii. 6</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> Pol., 2</bibl>). A more favourable side of the Spartan system of bondage is seen in the fact that a legal way to liberty and citizenship stood open to the Helots. The many intermediate steps seem to prove the existence of a regular mode of transition from the one rank to the other. The Helots who were esteemed worthy of an especial confidence were called <foreign lang="greek">ἀργεῖοι</foreign>; the <foreign lang="greek">ἀφέται</foreign> were probably released from all service. The <foreign lang="greek">δεσποσιοναῦται</foreign>, who served in the fleets, resembled probably the freedmen of Attica, who were called “the out-dwellers” (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ χωρὶς οἰκοῦντες</foreign>). When they received their liberty, they also obtained permission to dwell where they wished ( <bibl n="Thuc.  4. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iv. 80</bibl><bibl n="Thuc.  5. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc., v. 34</bibl>), and probably, at the same time, a portion of land was granted them without the lot of their former masters. After they had been in possession of liberty for some time, they appear to have been called <foreign lang="greek">νεοδαμώδεις</foreign> ( <bibl n="Thuc.  7. 58" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.vii. 58</bibl>), the number of whom soon came near to that of the citizens ( <bibl n="Plut. Ages. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Ages.</title>6</bibl>). The <foreign lang="greek">μόθωνες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μόθακες</foreign> were Helots, who, being brought up together with the young Spartans, obtained freedom without the rights of citizenship.</p>
 <p>The number of the Helots has been estimated by K. O. Müller and Schömann as having been some 225,000 at the time of the battle of Plataea, as against an estimated total population of 380,000 or 400,000 (Müller, <title>Dorians</title>, vol. ii. p. 30 foll., Eng. trans.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλουήττιοι</foreign>). A nation of Gaul, conquered by Caesar. Their country is generally supposed to have answered to modern Switzerland; but ancient Helvetia was of less extent than modern Switzerland, being bounded on the north by the Rhenus and Lacus Brigantinus, or Lake of Constance; on 
<pb n="787" /><cb />
 the south by the Rhodanus and the Lacus Lemannus, or Lake of Geneva; and on the west by Mons Iurassus (Jura) ( <title>B. G.</title> i. etc.;  <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 67" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 67</bibl><bibl n="Sal. Hist. 69" default="NO" valid="yes"> Hist., 69</bibl>). The chief town of the Helvetii was Aventicum, now Avenches. They were divided into four <seg lang="la">pagi</seg> or cantons, of which the names of only two are known—the Pagus Tigurinus (the most important pagus) and the Pagus (Vicus) Verbigenus (Urbigenus). It must be noted that the name Helvetia is a purely modern one—the country being spoken of in ancient times simply as Ager Helvetiorum.</p>
 <p>The Helvetii first appear in history during the war between the Romans and the Cimbri. In B.C. 107 the people of the Pagus Tigurinus defeated the Roman consul Cassius Longinus, while others of the race invaded Gaul and Italy, sharing in the defeat inflicted on the Cimbri by Marius and Catulus in B.C. 101. In the year 58, they attempted, on the advice of Orgetorix, an Helvetic chief, to migrate to Gaul, but were defeated and driven back by Caesar; after which the Romans planted colonies in these territories, with three fortresses at Aventicum, Vindonissa (Königsfelden), and Noviodunum (Nion). Under the later emperors, the country of the Helvetii, with that of the Sequani and Rauraci, formed the province known as Maxima Sequanorum. See Mommsen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Schweiz in röm.

<div2 id="crosshephaestus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἥφαιστος</foreign>). In Greek mythology, the god of fire, and of the arts which need fire in the execution. Roscher proposes various derivations of the name—from <foreign lang="greek">ἁφή</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἅπτω</foreign>), “a lighting,” or from the root of <foreign lang="greek">φαίνω</foreign>, “to shine.” He was said to be the son of Zeus and Heré, or, according to Hesiod, of the latter only. Being ugly, and lame in both feet, his mother was ashamed of him, and threw him from Olympus into the ocean, where he was taken up by Eurynomé and Thetis and concealed in a subterranean cavern. Here he remained for nine years, and fashioned a number of exquisite works of art, among them a golden throne with invisible chains, which he sent to his mother by way of revenge. She sat down in it, and was chained to the seat so fast that no one could release her. On this it was resolved to call Hephaestus back to Olympus. Ares wished to force him back, but was frightened off by his brother with firebrands. Dionysus at length succeeded in making him drunk and bringing him back in this condition to Olympus. But he was destined to meet with his former luck a second time. There came a quarrel between Zeus and Heré, and Hephaestus took his mother's part; whereupon Zeus seized him by the leg and hurled him down from Olympus. He fell upon the island of Lemnos, where the Sintians, who then inhabited the island, took care of him and finally revived <cb /> him. From this time Lemnos was his favourite abode. His lameness was, in the later story, attributed to this fall ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 590" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>i. 590</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>The whole story—the sojourn of Hephaestus in the cavern under the sea and his fondness for Lemnos—is, in all probability, based upon volcanic phenomena—the submarine activity of volcanic fires and the natural features of the island of Lemnos. Here there was a volcano called Mosychlus, which was in activity down to the time of Alexander the Great. The friendship existing between Dionysus and Hephaestus may be explained by the fact that the best and finest wines are grown in the volcanic regions of the South. <figure id="fig.00788">
<head orig="Hephaestus. (Bronze Statue in British Museum.)">Hephaestus. (Bronze Statue in British Museum.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>As a master in the production of beautiful and fascinating works of art, Hephaestus is in the <title>Iliad</title> the husband of a Charis, and in the <title>Odyssey</title> of Aphrodité, and in Hesiod of Aglaea. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscharites">Charites</ref>.) The story of his marriage with Aphrodité was not, apparently, widely known in early antiquity. Through his artistic genius he appears, and most especially in the Athenian story, as the intimate friend of Athené. In Homer he lives and works on Olympus, where he makes palaces of brass for himself and the other deities; but he has a forge also on Mount Mosychlus in Lemnos; the later story gives him one under Aetna in Sicily, and on the sacred island, or island of Hephaestus, in the Lipari Islands, where he is heard at work with his companions the Cyclopes. All the masterpieces of metal 
<pb n="789" /><cb />
 which appear in the stories of gods and heroes— the aegis of Zeus, the arms of Achilles, the sceptre of Agamemnon, the fatal necklace of Harmonia, the fire-breathing bulls of Aeëtes, the golden torchbearers in the palace of Alcinoüs, and others —were attributed to the art of Hephaestus. To help his lameness he made, according to Homer, two golden maidens, with the power of motion, to lean upon when he walked. He was much worshipped in Lemnos, where there was an annual festival in his honour. All fires were put out for nine days, during which rites of atonement and purification were performed. Then fresh fire was brought on a sacred ship from Delos, the fires were kindled again, and a new life, as the saying went, began. At Athens he was worshipped in the Academy, in connection with Athené and <ref type="cross" target="crossprometheus">Prometheus</ref> (q.v.). In October the smiths and smelters celebrated the <foreign lang="greek">Χαλκεῖα</foreign>, a feast of metal-workers, in his honour and that of Athené; at the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀπατούρια</foreign> sacrifices were offered to him, among other gods, as the giver of fire, and torches were kindled and hymns were sung; at the <foreign lang="greek">Ἡφαίστεια</foreign>, finally, there was a torch-race in his honour. The Greeks frequently set small dwarf-like images of Hephaestus near their fireplaces. In works of art he is represented as a vigorous man with a beard, equipped, like a smith, with hammer and tongs; his left leg is shortened, to show his lameness. The Romans identified him with their <ref type="cross" target="crossvulcanus">Vulcanus</ref> (q.v.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια</foreign>). A name given to more than forty towns in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the islands of the Mediterranean. They are supposed to have derived this name from Heracles, and to have either been built in honour of him or placed under his protection. The most famous of these places were:</p>

 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crosslyncestis">Lyncestis</ref>, a town of Macedonia, at the foot of the Candavian Mountains, on the confines of Illyria. Its ruins still retain the name of Erekli. Mention is made of this town in Caesar (<title>B. C.</title> iii. 79).</p>
 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crosssintica">Sintĭca</ref>, the principal town of the Sinti in Thrace. We are informed by Livy (xl. 24) that Demetrius, the son of Philip, was here imprisoned and murdered. Mannert thinks it the same with the Heraclea built by Amyntas, the brother of Philip.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Trachinia</hi>, a town of Thessaly, founded by the Lacedaemonians, and a colony from Trachis, about B.C. 426, in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War ( <bibl n="Thuc.  3. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iii. 92</bibl>). It was distant about sixty stadia from Thermopylae and twenty from the sea. Iason, tyrant of Pherae, took possession of this city at one period, and caused the walls to be pulled down ( <title>Hist. Gr.</title> vi. 4, 27). Heraclea, however, again arose from its ruins, and became <cb /> a flourishing city under the Aetolians, who sometimes held their general council within its walls (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 5</bibl>). It was taken by the Roman consul, Acilius Glabrio, after a long and obstinate siege (<bibl n="Liv.  37. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxvii. 24</bibl>; Polyb. x. 42).</p>

This place was famed for its naval power and its consequence among the Asiatic States.

<div2 id="crossheracles" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Herăcles">Heracles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρακλῆς</foreign>: Latin, <ref type="cross" target="crosshercules">Hercŭles</ref>). Heracles is not only one of the oldest heroes in the Greek mythology, but the most famous of all. Indeed, the traditions of similar heroes in other Greek tribes, and in other nations, especially in the East, were transferred to Heracles; so that the scene of his achievements, which is, in the Homeric poems, confined on the whole to Greece, became almost coextensive with the known world; 
<pb n="790" /><cb />
 and the story of Heracles was the richest and most comprehensive of all the heroic myths.</p>
 <p>Heracles was born in Thebes, and was the son of Zeus by Alcmené, the wife of Amphitryon, whose form the god assumed while he was absent in the war against the Teleboi. On the day which he should have been born, Zeus announced to the gods that a descendant of Perseus was about to see the light, who would hold sway over all the Perseïdae. Heré cunningly induced her consort to confirm his words with an oath. She hated the unborn son as the son of her rival, and hence in her capacity as the goddess of childbirth caused the queen of Sthenelus of Mycenae, a descendant of Perseus, to give birth prematurely to Eurystheus, while she postponed the birth of Heracles for seven days. Hence it was that Heracles, with his gigantic strength, came into the service of the weaker Eurystheus. Heré pursued him with her hatred during the whole of his natural life. He and his twin brother Iphicles, the son of Amphitryon, were hardly born, when the goddess sent two serpents to their cradle to destroy them. Heracles seized them and strangled them. The child grew up to be a strong youth, and was taught by Amphitryon to drive a chariot, by Autolycus to wrestle, by Eurytus to shoot with the bow, and by Castor to use the weapons of war. Chiron instructed him in the sciences, Rhadamanthus in virtue and wisdom, Eumolpus (or according to another account, Linus ) in music. When Linus attempted to chastise him, Heracles struck him dead with his lute. Amphitryon, accordingly, alarmed at his untamable temper, sent him to tend his flocks on Mount Cithaeron.</p>
 <p>It was at this time, according to the Sophist Prodicus, that the event occurred which occasioned the fable of the “Choice of Heracles” ( <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Mem.</title>ii. 2</bibl>). Heracles was meditating in solitude as to the path of life which he should choose, when two tall women appeared before him—the one called Pleasure, the other called Virtue. Pleasure promised him a life of enjoyment, Virtue a life of toil crowned by glory. He decided for Virtue. After destroying the savage lion of Cithaeron, he returned, in his eighteenth year, to Thebes, and freed the city from the tribute which it had been forced to pay to Erginus of Orchomenus, whose heralds he deprived of their ears and noses. Creon , king of Thebes, gave him, in gratitude, his daughter Megara as wife. But it was not long before the Delphic oracle commanded him to enter the service of Eurystheus, king of Mycenae and Tiryns, and perform twelve tasks which he should impose upon him. This was the humiliation which Heré had in store for him. The oracle promised him, at the same time, that he should win eternal glory, and indeed <cb /> immortality, and change his present name Alcaeus (from his paternal grandfather) or Alcides (from <foreign lang="greek">ἀλκή</foreign>, “strength”) for Heracles (“renowned through Heré”). Nevertheless, he fell into a fit of madness, in which he shot down the three children whom Megara had borne him. When healed of his insanity, he entered into the service of Eurystheus.</p>
 <p>The older story says nothing of the exact number (twelve) of the labours (<foreign lang="greek">ἆθλοι</foreign>) of Heracles. The number was apparently invented by the poet Pisander of Rhodes, who may have had in his eye the contests of the Phoenician god Melkart with the twelve hostile beasts of the Zodiac. It was also Pisander who first armed the hero with the club, and the skin taken from the lion of Cithaeron or Nemea. Heracles was previously represented as carrying bow and arrows, and the weapons of a Homeric hero.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The twelve labours of Heracles</hi> were as follows: (1) The contest with the invulnerable lion of Nemea, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. Heracles drove it into its cavern and strangled it in his arms. With the impenetrable hide, on which nothing could make any impression but the beast's own claws, he clothed himself, the jaws covering his head.</p>
 <p>(2) The hydra or water-snake of Lerna, also a child of Typhon and Echidna. This monster lived in the marsh of Lerna, near Argos, and was so poisonous that its very breath was fatal. It had nine heads, one of which was immortal. Heracles scared it out of its lair with burning arrows, and cut off its head; but for every head cut off two new ones arose. At length Iolaüs, the charioteer of Heracles and son of his brother Iphicles, seared the wounds with burning brands. Upon the immortal head he laid a heavy mass of rock. He anointed his arrows with the monster's gall, so that henceforth the wounds they inflicted were incurable. Eurystheus refused to accept this as a genuine victory, alleging the assistance offered by Iolaüs.</p>
 <p>(3) The boar of Erymanthus, which infested Arcadia. Heracles had been commanded to bring it alive to Mycenae, so he chased it into an expanse of snow, tired it out, and caught it in a noose. The mere sight of the beast threw Eurystheus into such a panic that he slunk away <figure id="fig.00790">
<head orig="Heracles and the Nemean Lion. (Pompeian painting. Overbeck.)">Heracles and the Nemean Lion. (Pompeian painting. Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="791" /><cb />
 into a tub underground and bid the hero, in future, to show the proof of his achievements outside the city gates. (On the contest with the Centaurs which Heracles had to undergo on his way to the chase, see <ref type="cross" target="crosspholus">Pholus</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosschiron">Chiron</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(4) The hind of Mount Cerynea, between Arcadia and Achaia. Another account localizes the event on Mount Maenalus, and speaks of the Maenalian hind. Its horns were of gold and its hoofs of brass, and it had been dedicated to Artemis by the Pleiad Taÿgeté. Heracles was to take the hind alive. He followed her for a whole year up to the source of the Ister in the country of the Hyperboreans. At length she returned to Arcadia, where he wounded her with an arrow on the banks of the Ladon, and so caught her.</p>
 <p>(5) The birds that infested the lake of Stymphalus, in Arcadia. These were man-eating monsters, with claws, wings, and beaks of brass, and feathers that they shot out like arrows. Heracles scared them with a brazen rattle, and succeeded in killing part, and driving away the rest, which settled on the island of Aretias in the Black Sea, to be frightened away, after a hard fight, by the Argonauts.</p>
 <p>(6) Heracles was commanded to bring home for Admeté, the daughter of Eurystheus, the girdle of Hippolyté, queen of the Amazons. After many adventures he landed at Themiscyra, and found the queen ready to give up the girdle of her own accord. But Heré spread a rumour among the Amazons that their queen was in danger, and a fierce battle took place, in which Heracles slew Hippolyté and many of her followers. On his return he slew, in the neighbourhood of Troy, a sea-monster, to whose fury King Laomedon had offered up his daughter Hesione. Laomedon refused to give Heracles the reward he had promised, whereupon the latter, who was hastening to return to Mycenae, threatened him with future vengeance. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslaomedon">Laomedon</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(7) The farm-yard of Augeas, king of Elis, in which lay the dung of three thousand cattle, was to be cleared in a day. Heracles completed the task by turning the rivers Alpheus and Peneus into the yard. Augeas now contended that Heracles was only acting on the commission of Eurystheus, and on this pretext refused him his promised reward. Heracles slew him afterwards with all his sons, and thereupon founded the Olympian Games. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugeas">Augeas</ref>).</p>
 <p>(8) A mad bull had been sent up from the sea by Poseidon to ravage the island of Creté, in revenge for the disobedience of Minos. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossminos">Minos</ref>.) Heracles was to bring him to Mycenae alive. He caught the bull, crossed the sea on his back, threw him over his neck and carried him to Mycenae, where he let him go. The animal wandered all through the Peloponnesus and ended by infesting the neighbourhood of Marathon, where he was at length slain by Theseus.</p>
 <p>(9) Diomedes, a son of Ares, and king of the Bistones in Thrace, had some mares which he used to feed on the flesh of the strangers landing in the country. After a severe struggle, Heracles overcame the king, threw his body to the mares, and took them off to Mycenae, where Eurystheus let them go.</p>
 <p>(10) The oxen of Geryones, the son of Chrysaor and the ocean nymph Callirrhoé. Geryones was a giant with three bodies and mighty wings, who dwelt on the island of Erythea, in the farthest West, on the borders of the Ocean stream. He had a herd of red cattle, which were watched by the shepherd Eurytion and his two-headed dog Orthrus, the offspring of Typhon <cb /> <figure id="fig.00791">
<head orig="Heracles and Bull. (From a bas-relief in the Vatican.)">Heracles and Bull. (From a bas-relief in the Vatican.)</head>
</figure> and Echidna. In quest of these cattle, Heracles, with many adventures, passed through Europe and Libya. On the boundary of both continents he set up, in memory of his arrival, the two pillars which bear his name, and at length reached the Ocean stream. Oppressed by the rays of the neighbouring sun, he aimed his bow at the Sungod, who marvelled at his courage, and gave him his golden bowl to cross the Ocean in. Arrived at Erythea, Heracles slew the shepherd and his dog, and drove off the cattle. Menoetius, who tended the herds of Hades in the neigbourhood, brought news to Geryones of what had happened. Geryones hurried in pursuit, but after a fierce contest fell before the arrows of Heracles. The hero returned with the cattle through Iberia, Gaul, Liguria, Italy, and Sicily, meeting everywhere with new adventures, and leaving behind him tokens of his presence. At the mouth of the Rhone he had a dreadful struggle with the Ligyes; his arrows were exhausted, and he had sunk in weariness upon his knee, when Zeus rained a shower of innumerable stones from heaven, with which he prevailed over his enemies. The place was ever after a stony desert plain, and was identified with the Campus Lapidosus near Massilia (Marseilles). (See, further, <ref type="cross" target="crosscacus">Cacus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosseryx">Eryx</ref>.) Heracles had made the circuit of the Adriatic and was just nearing Greece, when Heré sent a gadfly and scattered the herd. With much toil he wandered through the mountains of Thrace as far as the Hellespont, but then only succeeded in getting together a part of the cattle. After a dangerous adventure with the giant Alcyoneus, he succeeded at length in returning to Mycenae, where Eurystheus offered up the cattle to Heré ( <bibl n="Apollod.  1.6.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.i.6.1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(11) The golden apples of the Hesperides. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshesperides">Hesperides</ref>.) Heracles was ignorant where the gardens of the Hesperides were to be found in which the apples grew. He accordingly repaired to the nymphs who dwelt by the Eridanus, on whose counsel he surprised Nereus, the omniscient god of the sea, and compelled him to give an answer. On this he journeyed through Libya, Egypt, and Ethiopia, where he slew Antaeus, Busiris, and Emathion. (See under these titles.) He then crossed to Asia, passed through the Caucasus, where he set Prometheus free, and on through the land of the Hyperboreans till he found Atlas. Following the counsel 
<pb n="792" /><cb />
 of Prometheus, he sent Atlas to bring the apples, and in his absence bore the heavens for him on his shoulders. Atlas returned with them, but declined to take his burden upon his shoulders again, promising to carry the apples to Eurystheus himself. Heracles consented, and asked Atlas to take the burden only a moment, while he adjusted a cushion for his head; he then hurried off with his prize. Another account represents Heracles as slaying the serpent Ladon, who guarded the tree, and plucking the apples himself. Eurystheus presented him with the apples; he dedicated them to Athené, who restored them to their place.</p>
 <p>(12) Last he brought the dog Cerberus up from the lower world. This was the heaviest task of all. Conducted by Hermes and Athené, he descended into Hades at the promontory of Taenarum. In Hades he set Theseus free, and induced the prince of the infernal regions to let him take the dog to the realms of day, if only he could do so without using his weapons. Heracles bound the beast by the mere strength of arm, and carried him to Eurystheus, and took him back again into Hades. While in the upper world the dog, in his disgust, spat upon the ground, causing the poisonous herb aconite to spring up.</p>
 <p>His tasks were now ended, and he returned to Thebes. His first wife, Megara, he wedded to his faithful friend Iolaüs, and then journeyed into Oechalia to King Eurytus, whose daughter Iolé he meant to woo. The king's son Iphitus favoured his suit, but Eurytus rejected it with contempt. Soon after this Autolycus stole some of Eurytus's cattle, and he accused Heracles of the robbery. Meanwhile, Heracles had rescued Alcestis, the wife of <ref type="cross" target="crossadmetus">Admetus</ref> (q.v.), from death. Iphitus met Heracles, begged him to help him in looking for the stolen cattle, and accompanied him to Tiryns. Here, after hospitably entertaining him, Heracles threw him, in a fit of madness, from the battlements of his stronghold. A heavy sickness was sent on him for this murder, and Heracles prayed to the god of Delphi to heal him. Apollo rejected him, whereupon Heracles attempted to carry away the tripod. A conflict ensued, when Zeus parted the combatants with his lightning. The oracle bade Heracles to hire himself out for three years for three talents, and pay the money to Eurytus. Hermes put him into the service of Omphalé, queen of Lydia, daughter of Iardanus, and widow of Tmolus. Heracles was degraded to female drudgery, was clothed in soft raiment and set to spin wool, while the queen assumed the lion skin and the club. The time of service over, he undertook an expedition of vengeance against Laomedon of Troy. He landed on the coast of the Troad with eighteen ships, manned by the boldest of heroes, such as Telamon, Peleus, and Oïcles. Laomedon succeeded in surprising the guard by the ships and in slaying Oïcles. But the city was stormed, Telamon being the first to climb the wall, and Laomedon, with all his sons except Podarces, was slain by the arrows of Heracles. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspriamus">Priamus</ref>.) On his return Heré sent a tempest upon him. On the island of Cos he had a hard conflict to undergo with Eurytion, the son of Poseidon, and his sons. Heracles was at first wounded and forced to fly, but prevailed at length with the help of Zeus.</p>
 <p>After this Athené summoned the hero to the battle of the gods with the giants, who were not to be vanquished without his aid. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgigantes">Gigantes</ref>.) <cb /> Then Heracles returned to the Peloponnesus, and took vengeance on Augeas and on Neleus of Pylos, who had refused to purify him for the murder of Iphitus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugeas">Augeas</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmolionidae">Molionidae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossneleus">Neleus</ref>; Peridymenus.) In the battle with the Pylians he went so far as to wound Hades, who had come up to their assistance. Hippocoön of Sparta and his numerous sons he slew in revenge for their murder of Oeonus, a son of his maternal uncle Licymnius. In this contest his ally was King Cepheus of Tegea, by whose sister Augé he was father of Telephus. Cepheus with his twenty sons were left dead on the field.</p>
 <p>Heracles now won as his wife Deïanira, the daughter of Oeneus of Calydon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossachelous">Acheloüs</ref>.) He remained a long time with his father-in-law, and at length, with his wife and his son Hyllus, he passed on into Trachis to the hospitality of his friend Ceyx. At the ford of the river Evenus he encountered the Centaur Nessus, who had the right of carrying travellers across. Nessus remained behind and attempted to do violence to Deïanira, upon which Heracles shot him through with his poisoned arrows. The dying Centaur gave some of his infected blood to Deïanira, telling her that, should her husband be unfaithful, it would be a means of restoring him. Heracles had a stubborn contest with Theodamas, the king of the Dryopes, killed him, and took his son Hylas away. He then reached Trachis, and was received with the friendliest welcome by King Ceyx. Next he started to fight with <ref type="cross" target="crosscycnus">Cycnus</ref> (q.v.), who had challenged him to single combat; and afterwards, at the request of Aegimius, prince of the Dorians, undertook a war against the Lapithae, and an expedition of revenge against Eurytus of Oechalia. He stormed the fortress, slew Eurytus with his sons, and carried off Iolé, who had formerly been denied him, as his prisoner. He was about to offer a sacrifice to his father Zeus on Mount Cenaeum, when Deïanira, jealous of Iolé, sent him a robe stained with the blood of Nessus. It had hardly grown warm upon his body when the dreadful poison began to devour his flesh. Wild with anguish, he hurled Lichas, who brought him the robe, into the sea, where he was changed into a tall cliff. In the attempt to tear off the robe, he only tore off pieces of his flesh. Apollo bade him be carried to the top of Oeta, where he had a great funeral pyre built up for him. This he ascended; then he gave Iolé to his son Hyllus to be his wife, and bade Poeas, the father of Philoctetes, to kindle the pyre. According to another story, it was Philoctetes himself, whom Heracles presented with his bow and poisoned arrows, who performed this office. The flames had hardly started up, when a cloud descended from the sky with thunder and lightning, and carried the son of Zeus up to heaven, where he was welcomed as one of the immortals. Heré was reconciled to him, and he was wedded to her daughter Hebé, the goddess of eternal youth. Their children were Alexiares (“Averter of the Curse”) and Anicetus (“the Invincible”), the names merely personifying two of the main qualities for which the hero was worshipped.</p>
 <p>About the end of Heracles nothing is said in the <title>Iliad</title> but that he, the best-loved of Zeus's sons, did not escape death, but was overcome by fate, and by the heavy wrath of Heré. In the <title>Odyssey</title> his ghost, in form like black night, walks in the lower world with his bow bent and his arrows ready, 
<pb n="793" /><cb /> while the hero himself dwells among the immortals, the husband of Hebé. For the lives of his children, and the end of Eurystheus, see <ref type="cross" target="crosshyllus">Hyllus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Heracles was worshipped partly as a hero, to whom men brought the ordinary libations and offerings, and partly as an Olympian deity, an immortal among the immortals. Immediately after his apotheosis his friends offered sacrifice to him at the place of burning, and his worship spread from thence through all the tribes of Hellas. Diomus the son of Colyttus, an Athenian, is said to have been the first who paid him the honours of an immortal. It was he who founded the gymnasium called Cynosarges, near the city. This gymnasium, the sanctuary at Marathon, and the temple at Athens were the three most venerable shrines of Heracles in Attica. Diomus gave his name to the Diomeia, a merry festival held in Athens in honour of Heracles. Feasts to Heracles (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια</foreign>), with athletic contests, were celebrated in many places. He was the hero of labour and struggle, and the patron deity of the gymnasium and the palaestra. From early times he was regarded as having instituted the Olympic Games; as the founder of the Olympic sanctuaries and the Olympic truce, the planter of the shady groves, and the first competitor and victor in the contests. During his earthly life he had been a helper of gods and men, and had set the earth free from monsters and rascals. Accordingly he was invoked in all the perils of life as the saviour (<foreign lang="greek">σωτήρ</foreign>) and the averter of evil (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλεξίκακος</foreign>). Men prayed for his protection against locusts, flies, and noxious serpents. He was a wanderer, and had travelled over the whole world; therefore he was called on as the guide on marches and journeys (<foreign lang="greek">ἡγεμόνιος</foreign>). In another character he was the glorious conqueror (<foreign lang="greek">καλλίνικος</foreign>) who, after his toils are over, enjoys his rest with wine, feasting, and music. Indeed, the fable represents him as having, in his hours of repose, given as striking proofs of inexhaustible bodily power as in his struggles and contests. Men liked to think of him as an enormous eater, capable of devouring a whole ox; as a lusty boon companion, fond of delighting himself and others by playing the lyre. In Rome, as Hercules, he was coupled with the Muses, and, like Apollo elsewhere, was worshipped as <foreign lang="greek">Μουσαγέτης</foreign> (Hercules Musarum), or master of the Muses. (On the connection between Heracles and the Muses, see Klügmann in the <title>Commentationes in Honorem Th. Mommseni</title>, p. 262 [1877], and Lobeck, <title>Phryn.</title> 430). Under Augustus, Philippus built a temple to him at Rome as Hercules Musarum ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>29</bibl>, with Peck's note). After his labours he was supposed to have been fond of hot baths (<foreign lang="greek">θέρμαι</foreign>) which were accordingly deemed sacred to him. Among trees, the wild olive and white poplar were consecrated to him; the poplar he was believed to have brought from distant countries to Olympia.</p>
 <p>Owing to the influence of the Greek colonies in Italy, the worship of Heracles was widely diffused among the Italian tribes. It attached itself to local legends and religion; the conqueror of Cacus, for instance, was originally not Heracles, but a powerful shepherd called Garanos. Again, Heracles came to be identified with the ancient Italian deity Sancus or Dius Fidius, and was regarded as the god of happiness in home and field, industry and war, as well as of truth and honour. His altar was the Ara Maxima in the cattle-market (Forum Boarium), <cb /> which he was believed to have erected himself. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscacus">Cacus</ref>.) Here they dedicated to him a tithe of their gains in war and peace, ratified solemn treaties, and invoked his name to witness their oaths. He had many shrines and sacrifices in Rome, corresponding to his various titles, <title>Victor</title> (Conqueror), <title>Invictus</title> (Unconquered), <title>Custos</title> (Guardian), <title>Defensor</title> (Defender), and others. His rites were always performed in Greek fashion, with the head covered. It was in his temple that soldiers and gladiators were accustomed to hang up their arms when their service was over. In the stonequarries the labourers had their Hercules Saxarius <figure id="fig.00793">
<head orig="Farnese Hercules. (Naples Museum.)">Farnese Hercules. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure> (Hercules of the Stone). He was called the father of Latinus, the ancestor of the Latins, and to him the Roman gens of the Fabii traced their origin. The ancient family of the Potitii were said to have been commissioned by the god in person to provide, with the assistance of the Pinarii, for his sacrifices at the Ara Maxima (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 7</bibl>).

 <p>In works of art Heracles is represented as the ideal of manly strength, with full, well knit, and muscular limbs, serious expression, a curling beard, short neck, and a head small in proportion to the limbs. His equipment is generally the club and the lion's skin. The type appears to have been mainly fixed by Lysippus. The Farnese Hercules, by the Athenian Glycon, is probably a copy of one by Lysippus. Heracles is portrayed in repose, leaning on his club, which is covered with the lion's skin. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfarnese-hercules">Farnese Hercules</ref>.) The Heracles of the Athenian <ref type="cross" target="crossapollonius">Apollonius</ref> (q.v.), now only a torso, is equally celebrated.

<div2 id="crossheraclidae" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Heraclīdae">Heraclidae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρακλεῖδαι</foreign>). A name given in ancient legend to a powerful Achaean race or family, the fabled descendants of Heracles. According to the account of the ancient writers, the children of Heracles, after the death of that hero, being persecuted by Eurystheus, took refuge in Attica, and there defeated and slew the tyrant at the Scironian Rock, near the Saronic Gulf. When their enemy had fallen, they resumed possession of their birthright in the Peloponnesus; but they had not long enjoyed the fruits of their victory before a pestilence, in which they recognized the finger of heaven, drove them again into exile. Attica again afforded them a retreat. When their hopes had revived, an ambiguous oracle encouraged them to believe that, after they had reaped their third harvest, they should find a prosperous passage through the Isthmus into the land of their fathers. But, at the entrance of the Peloponnesus, they were met by the united forces of the Achaeans, Ionians, and Arcadians. Their leader Hyllus, the eldest son of Heracles, proposed to decide the quarrel by single combat; and Echemus, king of Tegea, was selected by the Peloponnesian confederates as their champion. Hyllus fell; and the Heraclidae were bound by the terms of the agreement to abandon their enterprise for a hundred, or, according to some accounts, for fifty, years. Yet both Cleodaeus, son of Hyllus, and his grandson Aristomachus, renewed the attempt with no better fortune. After Aristomachus had fallen in battle, the ambiguous oracle was explained to his sons Aristodemus, Temenus, and Cresphontes; and they were assured that the time, the third generation, had now come, when they should accomplish their return; not, however, as they had expected, over the guarded Isthmus, but across the mouth of the western gulf from Naupactus, where the opposite shores are parted by a channel only a few furlongs broad. Thus encouraged, with the aid of the Dorians, Aetolians, and Locrians, they crossed the strait, vanquished Tisamenus, son of Orestes, and divided the fairest <cb /> portion of the Peloponnesus among them. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdoris">Doris</ref>.) For the historical significance of this legend, see <ref type="cross" target="crosshellas">Hellas</ref>.

<div2 id="crossheraclitus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Heraclītus">Heraclitus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλειτος</foreign>). (1) A Greek philosopher of Ephesus, who lived about B.C. 535-475, during the time of the first Persian domination over his native city. As one of the last of the family of Androclus, the descendant of Codrus, who had founded the colony of Ephesus, Heraclitus had certain honorary regal privileges, which he renounced in favour of his brother. He likewise declined an invitation of King Darius to visit his court. He was an adherent of the aristocracy, and when, after the defeat of the Persians, the democratic party came into power, he withdrew in ill-humour to a secluded estate in the country, and gave himself up entirely to his studies. In his later years he wrote a philosophical treatise, which he deposited in the temple of Artemis, making it a condition that it should not be published till after his death. He was buried in the marketplace of Ephesus, and for several centuries later the Ephesians continued to engrave his image on their coins.</p>
 <p>Heraclitus was one of the subtlest of all the metaphysicians of Greece, and his importance as a philosopher lies in the fact that he was the founder of an independent metaphysical system which sought to obviate the difficulty of overcoming the contradictions between the one and the phenomenal many. His great work “On Nature” (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φύσεως</foreign>), in three books, was written in the Ionian dialect, and is the oldest monument of Greek prose. Considerable fragments of it have come down to us. The language is bold, harsh, and figurative; the style is so careless that the syntactical relations of the words are often hard to perceive; and the thoughts are profound. All this made Heraclitus so difficult a writer that he went in antiquity by the name “the Obscure” (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ σκοτεινός</foreign>), and Lucretius attacks him on this ground (<bibl n="Lucr. 1.638" default="NO" valid="yes">i. 638-644</bibl>). From his gloomy view of life he is often called “the Weeping Philosopher,” as Democritus is known as “the Laughing Philosopher.” Cf. Juv. x. 28 foll. 
<pb n="795" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Knowledge, according to Heraclitus, is based upon perception by the senses. Perfect knowledge is only given to the gods, but a progress in knowledge is possible to men. Wisdom consists in the recognition of the intelligence which, by means of the world-soul, guides the universe. Everything is in an eternal flux (<foreign lang="greek">πάντα ῥεῖ</foreign>); nothing therefore, not even the world in its momentary form, nor the gods themselves, can escape final destruction. The ultimate principle into which all existence is resolvable is fire. As fire changes continually into water and then into earth, so earth changes back to water and water again to fire. The world, therefore, arose from fire, and in alternating periods is resolved again into fire, to form itself anew out of this element. The division of unity, or of the divine original fire, into the multiplicity of opposing phenomena, is “the way downwards,” and the consequence of a war and a strife. Harmony and peace lead back to unity by “the way upwards.” Nature is constantly dividing and uniting herself, so that the multiplicity of opposites does not destroy the unity of the whole. The existence of these opposites depends only on the difference of the motion on “the way upwards” from that on “the way downwards”; all things, therefore, are at once identical and not identical. The principle of the universe is “becoming,” which implies that everything is and, at the same time, is not, so far as the same relation is concerned.</p>

<head orig="Herculaneum">Herculaneum</head>

 <p> <foreign lang="greek">Ἡράκλειον</foreign>). (1) A town in Samnium.</p>
 <p>(2) A city of Campania, on the coast, and not far from Neapolis (Naples). The form <hi rend="SmallCaps">Herculānum</hi> is modern. Nothing is known respecting the origin of Herculaneum, except that fabulous accounts ascribed its foundation to Hercules on his return from Spain (Dion. Hal. i. 44). It may be inferred, however, from a passage in Strabo, that the town was of great antiquity. It may be reasonably conjectured, too, that Herculaneum was a Greek city, but that its name was altered to suit the Latin or Oscan pronunciation. At first it was only a fortress, which was successively occupied by the Osci, Tyrrheni, Pelasgi, Samnites, and lastly by the Romans. Being situated close to the sea, on elevated ground, it was exposed to the southwest wind, and from that circumstance was reckoned particularly healthful. We learn from Velleius Paterculus that Herculaneum suffered considerably during the civil wars (cf. Florus, i. 16). This place is mentioned also by Mela (ii. 4). Ovid likewise notices it under the name of Urbs Herculea ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 15. 711" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xv. 711</bibl>). Herculaneum, according to the common account, was overwhelmed by an eruption of Vesuvius in the first year of the reign of Titus, A.D. 79. Pompeii and Stabiae, which stood near, shared the same fate. It is possible, however, that the subversion of Herculaneum was not sudden, but progressive, since Seneca mentions a partial demolition which it sustained from an earthquake (<title>Nat. Quaest.</title> vi. 1). After being buried for more than sixteen hundred years, these cities were accidentally discovered—Herculaneum in 1719, by labourers in deepening a well; and Pompeii some years after. It appears that Herculaneum is in no part less than forty feet, and in some parts one hundred and twelve feet below the surface of the ground. Little was done to exhume the city until 1738, when some regular excavations were made. Above the city stand the two modern villages of Portici and Resina in the suburbs of Naples; and to the fear of undermining their buildings is due the fact that so much of the ancient city is still beneath the earth. The chief edifice of Herculaneum that has been disinterred is a fine theatre, built only a short time before the eruption and capable of accommodating 8000 persons. Part of the Forum, a colonnade, two small temples, and a villa have also been recovered, besides ruins of baths. Many other valuable remains of antiquity, such as busts, manuscripts, etc., have been found in the ruins of this ancient city, and are deposited in the Museo Nazionale at Naples.

<head orig="Heré">Here</head>

 <p> (Ionic, <foreign lang="greek">Ἧρη</foreign>, and in Attic, <foreign lang="greek">Ἧρα</foreign>: the name is often connected with the Latin <hi rend="italic">hĕra;</hi> but on this, see Curtius, p. 119). In Greek mythology, the queen of heaven, eldest daughter of Cronus and Rhea, sister and lawful consort of Zeus. According to Homer, she was brought up in her youth by Oceanus and Tethys. But every place in which her worship was localized asserted that she was born there, and brought up by the Nymphs of the district. She is said to have long lived in secret intimacy with Zeus before he publicly acknowledged her as his lawful consort. Her worshippers celebrated her marriage (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερὸς γάμος</foreign>) in the spring time. In the oldest version of the story it took place in the Islands of the Blessed, on the shore of the Ocean stream, where the golden apple-tree of the Hesperides sprang up to celebrate it. But this honour, too, was claimed by every place where Heré was worshipped. According to one local story, Zeus obtained the love of Heré by stealth, in the form of a cuckoo.</p>
 <p>Heré seems originally to have symbolized the feminine aspects of the natural forces of which Zeus is the masculine representative. Hence she is at once his wife and his sister, shares his power and his honours, and, like him, has authority over the phenomena of the atmosphere. It is she who sends clouds and storms, and is mistress of the thunder and lightning. Her handmaids are the Horae or goddesses of the season, and Iris, the goddess of the rainbow. Like Zeus, men worship her on mountains, and pray to her for rain. The union of sun and rain, which wakes the earth to renewed fertility, is symbolized as the loving union of Zeus and Heré. In the same way a conflict of the winds is represented as the consequence of a matrimonial quarrel, usually attributed to the jealousy of Heré, who was regarded as the stern protectress of honourable marriage. Hence arose stories of Zeus illtreating his wife. It was said that he scourged her, and hurled Hephaestus from heaven to earth when hurrying to his mother's assistance; that in anger for her persecution of his son Heracles, he hung her out in the air with golden chains to her arms and an anvil on each foot ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8. 400" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>viii. 400</bibl>). There were also old legends which spoke of Heré allying herself with Athené and Poseidon to bind Zeus in <cb /> chains. Zeus was only rescued by the giant Aegaeon, whom Thetis called to his assistance. The birth of Athené was said to have enraged Heré to such a pitch that she became the mother of Typhon by the dark powers of the infernal regions. In fact, this constant resistance to the will of Zeus, and her jealousy and hatred of her consort's paramours and their children, especially Heracles, become in the poets a standing trait in her character.</p>
 <p>In spite of all this, Homer represents her as the most majestic of all the goddesses. The other Olympians pay her royal honours, and Zeus treats her with all respect and confides all his designs to her, though not always yielding to her demands. She is the spotless and uncorruptible wife of the king of Heaven; the mother of Hephaestus, Ares, Hebé, and Ilithyia, and indeed may be called the only lawful wife in the Olympian court. She is, accordingly, before all other deities the goddess of marriage and the protectress of purity in married life. She is represented as of exalted but severe beauty, and appears before Paris as competing with Aphrodité and Athené for the prize of loveliness. In Homer she is described as of lofty stature, large eyes (<foreign lang="greek">βοῶπις</foreign>), white arms (<foreign lang="greek">λευκώλενος</foreign>), and beautiful hair. On women she confers bloom and strength; she helps them, too, in the dangerous hour of childbirth. Her daughters Hebé and Ilithyia personify both these attributes.</p>
 <p>In earlier times Heré was not everywhere recognized as the consort of Zeus; at the primitive oracle of Dodona, for instance, Dioné occupies this position. The Peloponnesus may be regarded as <figure id="fig.00796">
<head orig="Head of Heré. (Naples. Supposed to be from a Statue by Polyclitus.)">Head of Here. (Naples. Supposed to be from a Statue by Polyclitus.)</head>
</figure> the earliest seat of her worship, and in the Peloponnesus, during the Homeric period, Argos, Mycenae, and Sparta are her favourite seats. Of these, according to the poet, she is the passionate champion in the Trojan War. In later times the worship of Heré was strongly localized in Argos and Mycenae. At Argos she took the same commanding position as Athené at Athens, and the year was dated by the names of her priestesses. Between 
<pb n="797" /><cb />
 these cities, at the foot of Mount Euboea, was situated the Heraeum (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡραῖον</foreign>), a temple held in great honour. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossheraea">Heraea</ref>.) At Corinth she was the goddess of the acropolis. At Elis a garment was offered her every five years by sixteen ladies chosen for the purpose, and maidens held a race in her honour on the race-course at Olympia. Boeotia had its feast of the <title>Daedala</title> (q. v.); Samos its large and splendid temple, built by Polycrates. The cuckoo was sacred to her as the messenger of spring, the season in which she was wedded to Zeus; so were the peacock and the crow, and among fruits the pomegranate, the symbol of wedded love and fruitfulness. Hecatombs were offered to her in sacrifice, as to Zeus.</p>
 <p>In works of art she is represented as seated on a throne in a full robe, covering the whole figure. On her head is a sort of diadem, often with a veil; the expression of the face is severe and majestic, the eyes large and wide open, as in the Homeric description. The ideal type of Heré was found in the statue by Polyclitus in the temple at Argos. This was a colossal image, in gold and ivory, representing the goddess on her throne, her crown adorned with figures of the Graces and the Seasons, a pomegranate in one hand, and in the other a sceptre with the cuckoo on the top. The Farnese Heré at Naples, and the Ludovisi Iuno in Rome, are copies of this work. The Romans identified Heré with their own <ref type="cross" target="crossiuno">Iuno</ref> (q.v.).

<head orig="Heres">Heres</head>

 <p> An heir. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. At Athens, if a person died intestate, leaving sons, all of equal birthright, and none of them disinherited, the sons inherited the property in equal parts (<foreign lang="greek">ἰσόμοιροι</foreign>), the eldest probably receiving the same share as the rest. If there were daughters, they were provided for by dowries given by the brothers, which, in case they were divorced or childless after marriage, went back to the remaining heirs. Girls so dowered were called <foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπροικοι</foreign>. This was a matter of usage and not of formal law. If a man had no sons of his own, he usually adopted a son to continue the family and the religious worship connected <cb /> with it. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossadoptio">Adoptio</ref>.) If he had daughters, he would marry one of them to the adopted son; in this case the chief share of the inheritance would fall to this married daughter and her husband, the rest receiving dowries. If there were only daughters surviving, the succession passed to them. In such a case the next of kin had a legal right to one of the heiresses (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίκληρος</foreign>), and could demand to marry her, even if she had married some one else before receiving the inheritance; and poor heiresses (<foreign lang="greek">θῆσσαι</foreign>), on the other hand, had a legal claim on their nearest of kin, either for marriage or for a provision suitable to their circumstances. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossepiclerus">Epiclerus</ref>.) If a man had married an heiress, he was bound by custom and tradition, if he had sons, to name one as heir to the property which had come with his wife, and thus to restore the house of the maternal grandfather. Children born out of wedlock were illegitimate, and had no claim on the father's estate. If a man died intestate, leaving no heirs either of his body or adopted, his nearest relations in the male line inherited, and in default of these, those in the female line as far as the children of first cousins. Any one thinking he had a legal claim to the inheritance made an application to the archon to hand it over to him. The application was posted up in public, and read out in the following Ecclesia (Assembly). The question was then asked whether any one disputed the claim, or raised a counter-claim. If not, the archon assigned the inheritance to the claimant; otherwise the matter was decided by a lawsuit. Even after the assignment of an inheritance, it might be disputed in the lifetime of the holder, and for five years after his death. The claim of the nearest relation to an heiress was in the same way lodged with the archon and ratified before the Assembly.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. If a Roman died intestate, leaving a wife and children of his body or adopted, they were his heirs (<seg lang="la">sui heredes</seg>). But this did not apply to married daughters who had passed into the <seg lang="la">manus</seg> of their husbands, or the children who had been freed by emancipation from the <seg lang="la">potestas</seg> of their father. If the man left no wife or children, the <seg lang="la">agnati</seg>, or relations in the male line, inherited, according to the degree of their kinship. If there were no <seg lang="la">agnati</seg>, and the man was a patrician, the property went to his gens. The <seg lang="la">cognati</seg>, or relations in the female line, were originally not entitled to inherit by the civil law. But, as time went on, their claim was gradually recognized more and more to the exclusion of the <seg lang="la">agnati</seg>, until at last Justinian entirely abolished the privilege of the latter, and substituted the principle of blood-relationships for that of the civil law. Vestal Virgins were regarded as entirely cut off from the family union, and therefore could not inherit from an intestate, nor, in case of their dying intestate, did the property go to their family, but to the State. On the other hand, unlike other women, they had unlimited right of testamentary disposition. If a freedman died intestate and childless, the <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> and his wife had the first claim to inherit, then their children, then their <seg lang="la">agnati</seg>, and (if the <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> was a patrician) then his gens. In later times, even if a freedman, dying childless, left a will, the <seg lang="la">patronus</seg> and his sons had claim to half the property. Augustus made a number of provisions in the matter of freedmen's inheritance. The civil law made it compulsory on a man's <seg lang="la">sui heredes</seg> to accept an inheritance (<seg lang="la">hereditatem adire</seg>) 
<pb n="798" /><cb />
 whether left by will or not. But as the debts were taken over with the property, the <seg lang="la">edictum</seg> of the praetor allowed the heirs to decline it. <title>A fortiori</title>, no other persons named in the will could be compelled to accept the legacy. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstestamentum">Testamentum</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>Heres necessarius</title> was a slave of the testator, who made him heir and <seg lang="la">liber</seg> at the same time. He was thus heir by necessity, becoming so without any action of his own, by the mere operation of the law. If a testator knew himself to be insolvent, he sometimes made a slave his heir to avoid the ignominy attached to a person whose property was sold to pay his debts (<bibl n="Gaius  2. 154" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, ii. 154</bibl>, etc.). The property of such an heir, acquired after his manumission, was not liable for the debts of the deceased. An insolvent inheritance was called <seg lang="la">damnosa hereditas.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Heres ex asse</title> was the phrase used to describe one who was sole heir. So <seg lang="la">heres ex dodrante</seg>, an heir to three-quarters of an estate ( <title>Iul.</title> 83); <seg lang="la">heres ex parte sexta</seg>, to the sixth; <seg lang="la">ex parte dimidia</seg>, to the half, etc.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμαῖ</foreign>), and dim. <hi rend="bold">Hermŭli</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἑρμίδια</foreign>). Pillars which terminated generally with a head of Hermes. In the earliest times Hermes (in whose worship the number 4 played a great part) was worshipped, especially in Arcadia (Pausan. viii. 4. 4), under the form of a simple quadrangular pillar of marble or wood, with the significant mark of the male sex. As art advanced, the pillar was surmounted, first with a bearded head, and afterwards with a youthful head of the god. Hermes being the god <figure id="fig.00798">

Sometimes they were inscribed with apothegms and riddles; sometimes also with inscriptions in honour of those who had fought bravely for their country (Demosth. <title>Lept.</title> 112;  <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 3. 183" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>3. 183</bibl>). In Athens there was an especially large number of them; in the marketplace <cb /> to the northwest of the Acropolis, the Hermae, erected partly by private individuals and partly by corporations, formed a long colonnade extending between the Hall of Paintings (<foreign lang="greek">στοὰ ποικίλη</foreign>) and the Royal Hall (<foreign lang="greek">στοὰ βασίλειος</foreign>). Accordingly, the latter was sometimes called the Hall of the Hermae. When the heads of other divinities (such as Athené, Heracles, Eros) were placed on such a pillar, it was then called Hermathena, Hermeracles, or Hermeros. At Rome the Hermae were used in the decoration of houses and villas, and also as posts for the ornamental railings of gardens. Great numbers have been preserved, and are now to be seen in the European museums.

The fable probably arose from the inclination, prevalent in the Eastern religions, towards confusing the attributes of both sexes. In Cyprus, for instance, a masculine Aphroditus, clad in female attire, was worshipped by the side of the goddess Aphrodité.

<head orig="Hermes">Hermes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμῆς</foreign>; Dor. <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμᾶς</foreign>). The son of Zeus and of the Naiad Maia, daughter of Atlas. Immediately after his birth upon the Arcadian mountain of Cyllené, he gave proof of his chief characteristics—inventiveness and versatility, united with fascination, trickery, and cunning. Born in the morning, by mid-day he had invented the lyre; in the evening he stole fifty head of cattle from his brother Apollo, which he hid so skilfully in a cave that they could not be found. After these exploits he lay down quietly in his cradle. Apollo, by means of his prophetic power, discovered the thief and took the offender to Zeus, who ordered the cattle to be given up. Hermes, however, so delighted his brother by his playing on the lyre that, in exchange for it, he allowed him to keep the cattle, resigned to him the golden staff of fortune and of riches, with the gift of prophecy in its humbler forms, and from that time forth became his best friend. Zeus made his son herald to the gods and the guide of the dead in Hades. In this myth are contained allusions to several attributes of the god.</p>
 <p>In many districts of Greece, and especially in Arcadia, the old seat of his worship, Hermes was regarded as a god who bestowed the blessing of fertility on the pastures and herds, and who was happiest when spending his time among shepherds and dallying with Nymphs, by whom he had numberless children, including Pan and Daphnis. In many places he was considered the god of crops, and also as the god of mining and of digging for buried treasure. His kindliness to man is also shown in his being the god of roads. At cross-roads in particular, there were raised in his honour, and called by his name, not only heaps of stones, to which every passer-by added a stone, but also the quadrangular pillars known as <ref type="cross" target="crosshermae">Hermae</ref> (q.v.). At Athens these last were set up in the streets and open spaces, and also before the doors. Every unexpected find on the road was called a gift of Hermes (<foreign lang="greek">ἕρμαιον</foreign>). Together with Athené, he escorted and protected heroes in perilous enterprises, and gave them prudent counsels. He took special delight in men's dealings with one another, in exchange and barter, in buying and selling; and in all that is won by craft or by theft. Thus he was the patron of tradespeople and thieves, and was himself the father of <ref type="cross" target="crossautolycus">Autolycus</ref> (q.v.), the greatest of all thieves. He, too, it was who endowed Pandora, the first woman, with the faculty of lying, and with flattering discourse and a crafty spirit. On account of his nimbleness and activity he was the messenger of Zeus, and knew how to carry out his father's commands with adroitness and cunning, 
<pb n="800" /><cb /> as in the slaying of Argos (the guard of Io), from which he derived his epithet of Argos-slayer (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀργειφόντης</foreign>). Again, as Hermes was the sacrificial herald of the gods, it was an important part of the duty of heralds to assist at sacrifices. It was on this account that the priestly race of the <foreign lang="greek">Κήρυκες</foreign> claimed him as the head of their family. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>.) Strength of voice and excel<figure id="fig.00800">
<head orig="Statue of Hermes. (Capitoline Museum, Rome.)">Statue of Hermes. (Capitoline Museum, Rome.)</head>
</figure> lence of memory were supposed to be derived from him in his capacity of herald. Owing to his vigour, dexterity, and personal charm, he was deemed the god of gymnastic skill, which makes men strong and handsome, and the especial patron of boxing, running, and throwing the discus; in this capacity the palaestrae and gymnasia were sacred to him, and particular feasts called Hermaea were dedicated to him. He was the discoverer of music (for besides the lyre he invented the shepherd's pipe), and he was also the god of wise and clever discourse. A later age made him even the inventor of letters, figures, mathematics, and astronomy. He was, besides, the god of sleep and of dreams; with one touch of his staff he could close or open the eyes of mortals; hence the custom, before going to sleep, of offering him the last libation. As he was the guide of the living on their way, so he was also the conductor of the souls of the dead in the nether-world (<foreign lang="greek">ψυχοπομπός</foreign>), and was as much <cb /> loved by the gods of those regions as by those above. For this reason sacrifices were offered to him in the event of deaths, Hermae were placed on the graves, and, at oracles and incantations of the dead, he was honoured as belonging to the lower world; in general, he was accounted the intermediary between the upper and lower worlds. His worship early spread throughout the whole of Greece. As he was born in the fourth month, the number four was sacred to him. In Argos the fourth month was named after him, and in Athens he was honoured with sacrifices on the fourth of every month. His altars and images (mostly simple Hermae) were in all the streets, thoroughfares, and open spaces, and also at the entrance of the palaestra.</p>
 <p>In art he is represented in the widely varying characters which he assumed, as a shepherd with a single animal from his flock, as a mischievous little thief, as the god of gain with a purse in his hand (see illustration), with a strigil as patron of the gymnasia, at other times with a lyre, but oftenest of all as the messenger of the gods. He was portrayed by the greatest sculptors, such as Phidias, Polyclitus, Scopas, and Praxiteles, whose Hermes with the infant Dionysus was discovered in 1877, in the temple of Heré, at Olympia. It is mentioned by Pausanias (vi. 19, 1), and is described by Treu in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Hermes mit dem Dionysosknaben</title> (Berlin, 1878)</bibl>. In the older works of art he appears as a bearded man (see illustration, p. 240); in the later ones, he is found in a graceful and charming attitude, as a slim youth with tranquil features, indicative of intellect and good-will. His usual attributes are wings on his golden sandals (<foreign lang="greek">πέδιλα</foreign>), and a flat, broad-brimmed hat (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspetasus">Petasus</ref>), which in later times was ornamented with wings, as was also his staff. This last (<foreign lang="greek">ῥάβδος, κηρύκειον</foreign>, <seg lang="la">caduceus</seg>) was originally an enchanter's wand, a symbol of power that produces wealth and prosperity, and also an emblem of influence over the living and the dead (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscaduceus">Caduceus</ref>), yet even in early times it was regarded as a herald's staff and an emblem of peaceful intercourse. It consisted of three shoots, one of which formed the handle, the other two being intertwined at the top in a knot. The place of the latter was afterwards taken by serpents; and thus arose our ordinary type of herald's staff.

<head orig="Hermes Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμῆς Τρισμέγιστος</foreign>). The Greek name for the Egyptian god Thoth, regarded as the author of civilization, the inventor of writing, of art, science, and religion. The sacred canon of the Egyptians, in forty-two books divided into six sections, constituting an encyclopaedia of general learning, was ascribed to him under the name of the “Hermetic Books.” They treat of religion, and of the arts and sciences, hieroglyphics, astronomy, medicine, mathematics, cosmography, etc. The date of the composition of this canon is not known, but it is evidently late, as the influence of Hellenic culture and the Neo-Platonic philosophy is clearly traceable. The Greek and Latin texts of these books exist only in fragments gathered from Stobaeus, Cyril, Lactantius, Suidas, and others. The Ebers Papyrus

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρώδης</foreign>). (1) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">the Great</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Ascalonīta</hi>, second son of Antipater the Idumaean, was born B.C. 71, at Ascalon, in Iudaea. At the age of twenty-five he was made by his father governor of Galilee, and distinguished himself by the suppression of a band of robbers and the execution of their leader. He was summoned before the Sanhedrim for having done this by his own authority, and having put these men to death without a trial; but, through the strength of his party and the zeal of his friends, he escaped censure. He at first embraced the party of Brutus and Cassius; but, after their death, reconciled himself to Antony, who appointed him and Phasael tetrarchs of Iudaea. In B.C. 40 the Parthians invaded Iudaea, and placed Antigonus on the throne, making Hyrcanus and Phasael prisoners. Herod escaped to Rome, where, by the influence of Antony, he was appointed king of the Jews. But the Roman generals in Syria assisted him very feebly, and it was not till the end of the year B.C. 38 that Jerusalem was taken by Sossius. The commencement of Herod's reign dates from the following year. In the year 38 he had married Mariamné, the granddaughter of Hyrcanus, hoping to strengthen his power by this match with the Asmonaean family, which was very popular in Iudaea. 
<pb n="803" /><cb /> On ascending the throne Herod appointed Ananel of Babylon high-priest, to the exclusion of Aristobulus, the brother of Mariamné. But he soon found himself compelled, by the entreaties <figure id="fig.00803">
<head orig="Coin of Herod the Great.">Coin of Herod the Great.</head>
</figure> of Mariamné and the artifices of her mother Alexandra, to depose Ananel and appoint Aristobulus in his place. Not long after, however, Aristobulus was secretly put to death by the command of Alexandra having informed Cleopatra of the murder, Herod was summoned to answer the accusation before Antony, whom he pacified by liberal bribes. When setting out to meet Antony, he had commanded his brother Joseph to put Mariamné to death in case he should be condemned, that she might not fall into Antony's power. Finding, on his return, that his brother had revealed this order to Mariamné, Herod put him to death. In the civil war between Octavius and Antony, Herod joined the latter, and undertook, at his command, a campaign against the Arabians, whom he defeated. After the battle of Actium, he went to meet Octavius at Rhodes, having first put to death Hyrcanus, who had been released by the Parthians, and had placed himself under Herod's protection some years before. He also imprisoned Mariamné and Alexandra, commanding their keepers to kill them upon receiving intelligence of his death. Octavius, however, received him kindly, and reinstated him in his kingdom. On his return, Mariamné reproached him with his intentions towards her, which she had again discovered. This led to an estrangement between Herod and his queen, which was artfully increased by his sister Salomé, till, on one occasion, enraged at a new affront he had received from Mariamné, Herod assembled some of his friends and accused her of adultery. She was condemned and executed. After her death Herod suffered the deepest remorse, and shut himself up in Samaria, where he was seized with an illness which nearly proved fatal. In the year B.C. 26 he put to death the sons of Babas, the last princes of the Asmonaean family.</p>
 <p>He now openly disregarded the Jewish law, and introduced Roman customs. He particularly shocked the people by erecting a stately theatre and an amphitheatre in Jerusalem, in the latter of which he celebrated games in honour of Augustus. Ten men conspired against his life, but were detected and executed with the greatest cruelty. To secure himself against rebellion, he fortified Samaria, which he named Sebasté (equivalent to the Latin Augusta), and he built Caesarea and other cities and fortresses. In the year B.C. 17 he began to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem. The work was completed in eight years, but the decorations were not finished for many years after (John, ii. 20). Herod's power and territories continued to increase, but the latter part of his reign was disturbed by the most violent dissensions <cb /> in his family, of which a minute account is given by Iosephus. He died in March, B.C. 4, in the thirty-fourth year of his reign and the seventieth of his age. Iosephus relates that, shortly before his death, he shut up many of the principal men of the Jewish nation in the Hippodrome, commanding his sister Salomé to put them to death as soon as he expired, that he might not want mourners. They were released, however, by Salomé upon Herod's death.</p>
 <p>The birth of Christ took place in the last year of Herod's reign, four years earlier than the era from which the common system of chronology dates the years A.D. (Ioseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xiv. 17 foll., xv. 1 foll., xvi. 1 foll.; <title>Bell. Iud.</title> i. 17, etc.). It was Herod of whom Augustus said, after he had heard of the former's having put to death his own sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, that he would rather be Herod's hog (<foreign lang="greek">ὗν</foreign>) than his son (<foreign lang="greek">υἱόν</foreign>), punning upon the similarity of the two terms, and alluding at the same time to the aversion with which the hog was regarded by the Jews (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.

Antipas, after being confirmed in these territories by Augustus, married the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia. He divorced her, however, A.D. 33, that he might marry his sisterin-law Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, who <figure id="fig.00803.3">
<head orig="Coin of Herod Antipas.">Coin of Herod Antipas.</head>
</figure> was still living. John the Baptist, exclaiming against this union, was seized, and subsequently beheaded. Afterwards, A.D. 39, Herodias, being jealous of the prosperity of her brother Agrippa, who, from a private person, had become king of Iudaea, persuaded her husband Herod Antipas to visit Rome, and to desire the same dignity from Tiberius. Agrippa, being apprised of his design, wrote to the emperor, accusing Antipas of being implicated in the affair of Seianus, upon which he was banished to Lugdunum, in Gaul. This is the Antipas who, being at Jerusalem at the time of the Saviour's suffering, ridiculed Jesus, whom Pilate had sent to him, dressed him in mock attire, and sent him back to the Roman governor as a king whose ambition gave him no umbrage. The year of his death is unknown, though it is certain that he and Herodias ended their days in exile, according to Iosephus, in Spain.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Agrippa I.</hi>, son of Aristobulus and Berenicé, and grandson of Herod the Great. 
<pb n="804" /><cb /> He was educated at Rome with the future emperor Claudius, and Drusus the son of Tiberius. Having given offence to Tiberius, he was thrown into prison; but Caligula, on his accession (A.D. 37), set him at liberty, and gave him the tetrarchies of Abilené, Batanaea, Trachonitis, and Auranitis. On the death of Caligula in 41, Agrippa, who was at the time in Rome, assisted Claudius in gaining possession of the Empire. As a reward for his services, Iudaea and Samaria were annexed to his dominions. His government was mild, and he was exceedingly popular among the Jews. It was probably to increase this popularity that he caused the apostle James to be beheaded and Peter to be cast into prison (A.D. 44). The manner of his death, which took place at Caesarea in the same year, is related in Acts, xii. By his wife Cypros he had a son Agrippa and three daughters—Berenicé, <figure id="fig.00804">

 <p>(5) Son of Agrippa I., was educated at the court of Claudius, and at the time of his father's death was seventeen years old. Claudius kept him at Rome, and sent Cuspius Fadus as procurator of the kingdom, which thus again became a Roman province. On the death of Herodes, king of Chalcis (48), his little principality was given to Agrippa, who subsequently received an accession of territory. Before the outbreak of the war with the Romans, Agrippa attempted in vain to dissuade the Jews from rebelling. He sided with the Romans in the war, and after the capture of Jerusalem he went with his sister Berenicé to Rome, and died in the seventieth year of his age, A.D. 100.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρωδιανός</foreign>). (1) The author of an extant history, in the Greek language, of the Roman Empire, in eight books, from the death of Marcus Aurelius to the commencement of the reign of Gordianus III. (A.D. 180-238). He states that the events described by him occurred during the period of his own life, which serves to fix his date, but of the details of his career nothing is known. He seems to have made Thucydides his model, and his narrative is characterized by sobriety, impartiality, and in general by accuracy. His style is good in spite of numerous Latinisms.

<div2 id="crossherodotus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Herodŏtus">Herodotus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρόδοτος</foreign>). (1) A celebrated Greek historian, born at Halicarnassus in Caria, B.C. 484 (Clinton, <title>Fasti Hellenici</title>, vol. i. p. 29, 2d ed.). He was of Dorian extraction, and of a distinguished family. His father was named Lyxes, his mother Rhoeo or Dryo. Panyasis, an eminent epic poet, whom some ranked next to Homer, was his uncle either by the mother's or father's side. The facts of his life are few and doubtful, except so far as we can gather them from his own works. Not liking the government of Lydgamis, the grandson of Queen Artemisia, who was tyrant of Halicarnassus, Herodotus retired for a season to the island of Samos, where he is said to have cultivated the Ionic dialect of the Greek, which was the language there prevalent. Before he was thirty years of age he joined a number of his fellow-exiles in an attempt, which proved successful, to expel Lygdamis. But the banishment of the tyrant did not give tranquillity to Halicarnassus, and Herodotus, who himself had become an object of dislike, again left his native country and visited Athens, where he made the acquaintance of many of the brilliant writers of the time. Of these, Sophocles became his intimate friend, and wrote a poem in his honour in B.C. 440, a fragment of which is preserved by Plutarch. (See Hanna, <title>Sophokles' Beziehungen zu Herodot</title> [1875]). Eusebius states that he received at Athens many public marks of distinction. As Athenian citizenship was not open to him, he joined, as it is said, a colony which the Athenians sent to Thurii in Southern Italy, about B.C. 443. He is said to have died in Thurii, and to have been buried in the market-place.</p>
 <p>Herodotus is regarded by many as the father of profane history, and Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> i. 1) calls him <seg lang="la">historiae patrem;</seg> by which, however, nothing more must be meant than that he is the first profane historian whose work is distinguished for its finished form, and has come down to us entire. Thus Cicero himself, on another occasion, speaks of him as the one <title>qui princeps genus hoc (scribendi) ornavit (De Orat.</title> ii. 13); while Dionysius of Halicarnassus has given us a list of many historical writers who preceded him.</p>
 <p>Herodotus presents himself to our consideration in two points: as a traveller and observer, and as 
<pb n="805" /><cb />
 an historian. The extent of his travels may be ascertained pretty clearly from his history; but the order in which he visited each place, and the time of his visit, cannot be determined. The story of his reading his work at the Olympic Games, on which occasion he is said to have received universal applause, and to have had the names of the nine Muses given to the nine books of his history, has been disproved. The story is founded upon a small piece by Lucian, entitled “Herodotus or Aëtion,” which apparently was not intended by the writer himself as an historical truth; and, in addition to this, Herodotus was only about twentyeight years old ( Suid. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης</foreign>) when he is said to have read to the assembled Greeks at Olympia a work which was the result of most extensive travelling and research, and which bears in every part of it evident marks of the hand of a man of mature age. The Olympic recitation is not even alluded to by Plutarch, in his treatise on the “malignity” of Herodotus. Furthermore, it is certain that the division of his work into books was not known to Herodotus himself, but was probably due to the Alexandrian grammarians. It is first mentioned by Diodorus Siculus. At a later period Herodotus read his history, as we are informed by Plutarch and Eusebius , at the Panathenaean festival at Athens, and the Athenians are said to have <cb /> presented him with the sum of ten talents for the manner in which he had spoken of the deeds of their nation. The account of this second recitation may be true.</p>
 <p>With a simplicity which characterizes his whole work, Herodotus makes no display of the great extent of his travels. He frequently avoids saying in express terms that he was at a place, but he uses words which are as conclusive as any positive statement. He describes a thing as standing behind the door (ii. 182), or on the right hand as you enter a temple (i. 51); or he was told something by a person in a particular place (ii. 28); or he uses other words equally significant. In Africa he visited Egypt (see Budinger, <title>Die ägyptische Forschung Herodot's</title> [Vienna, 1873]), from the coast of the Mediterranean to Elephantiné, the southern extremity of the country (ii. 29); and he travelled westward as far as Cyrené (ii. 32, 181), and probably farther. (See Neumann, <title>Nordafrika nach Herodot</title> [1893]). In Asia he visited Tyre, Babylon, Ecbatana (i. 98), Nineveh, and probably Susa (v. 52 foll., vi. 119). He also travelled to various parts of Asia Minor, and probably went as far as Colchis (ii. 104). In Europe he visited a large part of the country along the Black Sea, between the mouths of the Danube and the Crimea, and went some distance into the interior. He seems to have examined the line of the march of Xerxes from the Hellespont to Attica, and certainly had seen numerous places on this route. He was well acquainted with Athens (i. 98, v. 77), and also with Delphi, Dodona, Olympia, Delos, and many other places in Greece. That he had visited some parts of Southern Italy is clear from his work (iv. 99, v. 44). The mention of these places is sufficient to show that he must have seen many more. (See Hildebrandt, <title>De Itineribus Herodoti Europaeis et Africanis</title> [Leipzing, 1883].) So wide and varied a field of observation has rarely been presented to a traveller, and still more rarely to any historian of either ancient or modern times; and, if we cannot affirm that the author undertook his travels with a view to collecting materials for his great work, a supposition which is far from improbable, it is certain that, without such advantages, he could never have written it, and that his travels must have suggested much inquiry, and supplied many valuable facts, which afterwards found a place in his history.</p>
 <p>The nine books of Herodotus contain a great variety of matter, the unity of which is not perceived till the whole work has been thoroughly examined; and for this reason, on a first perusal, the history is seldom well understood. But the subject of that history was conceived by the author both clearly and comprehensively. His aim was to combine a general history of the Greeks and the barbarians (i. e. those not Greeks) with the history of the wars between the Greeks and Persians. Accordingly, in the execution of his main task, he traces the course of events from the time when the Lydian kingdom of Croesus fell before the arms of Cyrus, the founder of the Persian monarchy (B.C. 546), to the capture of Sestus (B.C. 478), an event which completed the triumph of the Greeks over the Persians. The great subject of his work, which is comprised within the space of sixty-eight years, advances, with a regular progress and truly dramatic development, from the first weak and divided efforts of the Greeks to resist Asiatic numbers, to their union as a nation, and their final triumph 
<pb n="806" /><cb /> in the memorable battles of Thermopylae, Salamis, Plataea, and Mycalé. But with this subject, which has a complete unity, well maintained from its commencement to its close, the author has interwoven, conformably to his general purpose, and by way of occasional digression, sketches of the various people and countries which he had visited in his wide-extended travels. The more one contemplates the difficulty of thus combining a kind of universal history with a substantial and distinct narrative, the more one must admire, not so much the art of the historian, as his happy power of bringing together and arranging his materials, which was the result of the fulness of his information, the distinctness of his knowledge, and his clear conception of the subject. These numerous digressions are among the most valuable parts of his work; and, if they had been omitted or lost, barren indeed would have been modern investigation in the field of ancient history, over which the labour of this one great writer now throws a clear and steady light. The anecdotes, also, that sparkle through his pages are fascinating in their variety and in the illustrations they afford of the life and manners of the age that he describes.</p>
 <p>The style of Herodotus is simple, pleasing, and highly picturesque; often, indeed, poetical both in expression and sentiment, and bearing evident marks of belonging to a period when prose composition had not yet become a finished art. That he was a close student of Homer is evident in every page of the history, since his phrases and expressions are everywhere coloured by the Homeric influence. Hence, Dionysius of Halicarnassus calls him <foreign lang="greek">Ὁμήρου ζηλωτής</foreign>, and Longinus <foreign lang="greek">μόνος Ὁμηρικώτατος</foreign>. So graceful and winning was his style that Athenaeus describes him as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ μελίγηρυς</foreign>. His information is apparently the result of his own experience. In physical knowledge he was somewhat behind the science of even his own day. He had, no doubt, reflected on political questions; but he seems to have formed his opinions mainly from what he himself had observed. To pure philosophical speculations he had no inclination, and there is not a trace of such in his writings. He had a strong religious feeling bordering on superstition, though even here he clearly distinguished the gross and absurd from that which was reasonable. He seems to have viewed the manners and customs of all nations in a more truly philosophical way than many so-called philosophers, considering them all as various forms of social existence under which happiness might be found. He treats with respect the religious observances of every nation; a decisive proof of his great good sense. Until lately there was a strong tendency to exaggerate the credulity of Herodotus; but a fuller knowledge of the countries described by him has justified many of the statements once regarded as absurd. Moreover, a distinction must be drawn between the things he tells of his own knowledge and those which he merely relates as having been told him by other persons. The exquisite lines quoted by Prof. Merriam in his introduction are wonderfully descriptive of the whole tone and spirit of Herodotus: <lb />“He was a mild old man and cherished much <lb />The weight dark Egypt on his spirit laid; <lb />And with a sinuous eloquence would touch <lb />Forever at that haven of the dead. <cb /> <lb />Single romantic words by him were thrown <lb />As types on men and places, with a power <lb />Like that of shifting sunlight after shower <lb />Kindling the cones of hills and journeying on. <lb />He feared the gods and heroes and spake low <lb />That Echo might not hear in her light room.”</p>
 <p>Plutarch accused Herodotus of partiality, and composed a treatise on what he termed the “spitefulness” of this writer (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῆς Ἡροδότου Κακοηθείας</foreign>), taxing him with injustice towards the Thebans, Corinthians, and Greeks in general; but the whole monograph is weak and frivolous.</p>
 <p>Herodotus had planned to write a work on Assyrian history (i. 106, 184), but whether or not he ever carried out his intention is not known. A life of Homer has been commonly ascribed to Herodotus, and appears in some editions of his history; but it is now deemed spurious.

<head orig="Herophĭlus">Herophilus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡρόφιλος</foreign>). A celebrated physician, a native of Chalcedon, of the family of the Asclepiades, and a disciple of Praxagoras. Herophilus lived under Ptolemy Soter, and was contemporary with the philosopher Diodorus, and the celebrated physician Erasistratus, with whose name his own is commonly associated in the history of anatomical science. As a physician, Herophilus is mentioned with praise by both the ancient and the early modern writers. Galen says that he carried anatomy to the highest degree of perfection. With such zeal, indeed, did Herophilus pursue this science, that he is said to have dissected 700 subjects, and it was against him and Erasistratus that the charge was first made of having frequently opened living criminals that they might discover the secret springs of life (Celsus, <title>Praef.</title>). From the peculiar advantages which the school of Alexandria presented by this authorized dissection of the human body, it gained, and for many centuries preserved, <cb /> the first reputation for medical education, so that Ammianus Marcellinus, who lived about 650 years after its establishment, says that it was sufficient to secure credit to any physician if he could say that he had studied at Alexandria (Amm. Marc. xxii. 16). Herophilus made great discoveries in anatomy, and Fallopius calls him “the evangelist of anatomists.” He is to be regarded as the inventor of pathological anatomy, having been the first that thought of opening the bodies of men after death in order to ascertain the nature of the malady which had caused their dissolution. His principal discoveries have reference to the nervous system, which he acknowledged as the seat of the sensations. The description which Herophilus gave of the brain itself was far superior to those of previous authors. He also noticed the lacteals, though he was not aware of their use. He pointed out that the first division of the intestinal canal is never more than the breadth of twelve fingers in length, and from this fact proposed for it a name (<foreign lang="greek">δωδεκαδακτύλη ἔκφυσις</foreign>), the Latin form of which (<hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi>) is still applied to it. He described with great exactness the organ of sight, and gave to its various membranes the names which have still, in a great measure, remained to them. He operated on the cataract by extracting the crystalline humour. Herophilus was the first, also, that had correct notions respecting the pulse, of which his master, Praxagoras, had taught him some of the value as a means of discriminating diseases (Galen, <title>De Diff. Puls.</title> ii. p. 24; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 11. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xi. 37</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 29. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H.

<div2 id="crossheros" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Heros">Heros</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἥρως</foreign>, “a hero”). In Homer, a descriptive title given to princes and nobles, but also applied to men of mark sprung from the people. Hesiod reserves the name for mortals of divine origin, who are therefore known as demigods. Many of these he places on the Islands of the Blessed, where, under the sovereignty of Cronus, they lead a life of happiness. Hesiod makes no allusion to the influence of heroes upon the life of man, or to the worship due to them in consequence. But in later times this belief spread throughout the whole of Greece. The heroes are in most respects like men and suffer death; but death puts them in a more exalted rank, and they then have power to do men good as well as harm. The most distinguished warriors of prehistoric times were accounted heroes, being generally regarded as the offspring of gods by mortal women; to their souls another destiny was accordingly assigned than that allotted to the souls of mortals. But even among the heroes of old time there were some who, without being children of the gods, nevertheless so distinguished themselves by their virtue that they appeared to participate in the divine nature, and therefore to deserve a higher distinction after death. Even in later times such men were not unknown, when personages recently deceased were actually exalted to the ranks of heroes, as in the case of Leonidas at Sparta, and Harmodius and Aristogiton at Athens. The founders of colonies and cities (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχηγέται, κτίσται</foreign>) were especially considered worthy of worship as heroes; 
<pb n="808" /><cb />
 when the true founder was unknown, then some appropriate hero was selected instead. Formerly there were many such fictitious heroes; to this class properly belong all the titular ancestors of the noble and priestly families of Attica and the founders of particular arts and trades, as Daedalus, Triptolemus, etc. Many heroes of historical times were originally gods, who, in course of time, were divested of their primitive dignity. There was no town or district of Greece in which a host of heroes was not worshipped by the side of the higher divinities; many as special tutelary spirits of the country, others as the heroes of the country, as the Dioscuri at Sparta, the Aeacidae at Aegina, and Theseus in Attica. There were festivals in their honour everywhere, many of them small and unimportant, and only celebrated in a restricted circle, others observed by the State as festivals of the people in general, and not at all inferior in wealth of equipment to the most important festivals in honour of the gods. This was especially the case with the heroes of the country. Many heroes (e. g. Adrastus, Theseus) had shrines, known as Heroa, which were generally erected over their graves ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 67</bibl>). The altars of heroes were lower than those of gods, and were commonly designated sacrificial hearths; they were generally on a level with the ground, and on the west side —the region of the nether world—were provided with a hollow, into which the libations were poured. Like offerings to the dead, these consisted of honey, wine, water, milk, oil, and blood which had been shed by sacrificial victims; the flesh of the animals sacrificed was burned. In the period of decadence it became customary to treat the living with heroic honours. Such honours were paid to the Spartan Lysander by the towns in Asia Minor, and were afterwards accorded to kings—e. g. to Antigonus and his son Demetrius at Athens.</p>
 <p>The Greek <foreign lang="greek">ἥρως</foreign> is used as an equivalent of the Latin <seg lang="la">divus</seg>, as applied to those who once were mortal, and hence opposed to <seg lang="la">deus</seg>, one who was from the first a god.

She was supposed to take part in human affairs, and even sometimes to come among mortals.

Whenever it was known that the goddess had descended into this her sanctuary, her car was got ready, cows were yoked to it, and the deity was carried around in the covered vehicle. Festivity reigned in every place which the goddess honoured with her presence; wars ceased, arms were laid aside, and peace and harmony prevailed, until the priest declared that the goddess was sated with human society, and once more enclosed her within the temple. The island mentioned by Tacitus is supposed by many to have been that of Rügen, in the Baltic, while others have placed it in the Northern Ocean.

<div2 id="crosshesiodus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hesiŏdus">Hesiodus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡσίοδος</foreign>). A celebrated Greek poet, supposed to have been born at Ascra in Boeotia (<title>Op. et D.</title> 633 foll.). His father, it seems, had migrated to Ascra in consequence of his poverty, and resided at the latter place for some time, though without obtaining the rights of a citizen. Still, however, he left at his death a considerable property to his two sons, Hesiod, and a younger one named Perses. The brothers divided the inheritance; but Perses, by means of bribes to the judges, contrived to defraud his elder brother. Hesiod thereupon migrated to Orchomenus, as Göttling supposes, and the harsh epithets which he applies to his native village were, in all probability, prompted by resentment at the wrong which he had suffered from the Ascraean judges. From a passage in the proëm to his <title>Theogony</title>, it has been inferred that Hesiod was literally a shepherd, and tended his flocks on the side of Helicon. He was evidently born in an humble station, and was himself engaged in rural pursuits; and this perfectly accords with the subject of the poem which was unanimously ascribed to him—namely, the <title>Works and Days</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι</foreign>), which is a collection of reflections and precepts relating to husbandry and the regulation of a rural household, interwoven with fables, allegories, etc., forming, as has been said, “a Boeotian shepherd's-calendar.” The only additional fact that can be gathered from Hesiod's writings is that he went over to the island of Euboea, on occasion of a poetical contest at Chalcis, which formed part of the funeral games instituted in honour of Amphidamas; that he obtained a tripod as the prize, and consecrated it to the Muses of Helicon. This latter passage is suspected by Wolf; but it seems to have formed a part of the poem from time immemorial; and it may not be unreasonable to infer its authenticity from the tradition respecting an imaginary contest between Homer and Hesiod.</p>
 <p>The following legendary account is given as to the manner of Hesiod's death. He is said to have consulted the oracle of Delphi as to his future destinies, and the Pythia directed him, in reply, to shun the grove of Nemean Zeus, since there death awaited him. There were at Argos a temple and a brazen statue of Zeus; and Hesiod, believing this to be the fatal spot, directed his course to Oenoë, a town of the Locri; but the ambiguity of the oracle had deceived him, for 
<pb n="809" /><cb />
 this place also, by obscure report, was sacred to the same god. He was here the guest of two brothers. It happened that their sister Clymené was violated in the night-time by the person who had accompanied Hesiod, and hanged herself in consequence of the outrage. This man they accordingly slew; and, suspecting the connivance of Hesiod, killed him also, and threw his body into the sea. The murder is said to have been detected by the sagacity of Hesiod's dog; though by some it is related that his corpse was brought to the shore by a company of dolphins, at the moment that the people were celebrating the festival of Poseidon. The body of Hesiod was recognized, the houses of the murderers were razed to the foundation, and the murderers themselves cast into the sea. Another account states them to have been consumed by lightning; a third, to have been overtaken by a tempest while escaping to Crete in a fishing-boat, and to have perished in the wreck.</p>
 <p>The only works that remain under the name of Hesiod are: (i.) <foreign lang="greek">Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι</foreign> (“Works and Days”); (ii.) <foreign lang="greek">Θεογονία</foreign> (“Theogony”); (iii.) <foreign lang="greek">Ἀσπὶς Ἡρακλέους</foreign> (“The Shield of Heracles”). The <title>Works and Days</title> (which, according to Pausanias, the Boeotians regarded as the only genuine production of Hesiod) is entirely occupied with the events of common life. The poem consists of advice given by Hesiod to his brother Perses, on subjects relating for the most part to agriculture and the general conduct of life. The object of the first portion of the poem is to improve the character and habits of Perses, and to incite him to a life of labour, as the only source of permanent prosperity. Mythical narratives, fables, descriptions, and moral apophthegms, partly of a proverbial kind, are ingeniously chosen and combined, so as to illustrate and enforce the principal idea, and served as a model for Vergil in his <title>Georgics.</title> In the second part Hesiod shows Perses the succession in which his labours must follow, if he determines to lead a life of industry. The poet speaks of the time of life when a man should marry, and how he should look out for a wife. He recommends all to bear in mind that the immortal gods watch over the actions of men; in all intercourse with others to keep the tongue from idle and provoking words, and to preserve a certain purity and care in the commonest occurrences of every-day life. At the same time, he gives many curious precepts, which resemble sacerdotal rules, with respect to the decorum to be observed in acts of worship, and which, moreover, have much in common with the symbolic rules of the Pythagoreans, that ascribed a spiritual import to many acts of ordinary life. Of a very similar nature is the last part of the poem, which treats of the days on which it is expedient or inexpedient to do this or that business.</p>
 <p>The <title>Theogony</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεογονία</foreign>) consists of an account of the origin of the world, including the birth of the gods, and makes use of numerous personifications. Even as early as the time of Pausanias (viii. 18, ix. 31) it was doubted whether Hesiod was actually the author of this poem, though its genuineness is expressly asserted by Herodotus (ii. 53), and all the internal evidence is in favour of this view. According to Hermann, it is a species of <hi rend="italic">mélange</hi>, formed by the union of several poems on the same subject, and which has been effected by the same <cb /> copyists or grammarians. The <title>Theogony</title> is interesting as being the most ancient monument that we have of the Greek mythology. When we consider it as a poem, we find no composition of ancient times so stamped with a rude simplicity of character. It is without luminous order of arrangement, abounds with dry details, and only occasionally rises to any particular elevation of fancy. It exhibits that crude irregularity and that mixture of meanness and grandeur which characterize a strong but uncultivated genius. The censure of Quintilian that “Hesiod rarely soars, and a great part of him is occupied in mere names,” is undoubtedly merited. The sentence just quoted, however, refers plainly to the <title>Theogony</title> alone, while the following seems exclusively applicable to the <title>Works and Days:</title> “Yet he is distinguished by useful sentences of morality, and an admirable sweetness of diction and expression, and he deserves the palm in the middle style of writing.” The passage relating to the battle of the gods, however, can not surely be classed among the specimens of the middle style. This passage, together with the combat of Zeus and Typhoëus, astonishes the reader by sudden bursts of enthusiasm, for which the prolix and nerveless narrative of the general poem has little prepared him. Mahaffy speaks of it as having “a splendid crash and thunder about it,” and even as “far superior in conception, though inferior in execution, to the battle of the gods in the <title>Iliad.</title>” Milton has borrowed some suggestions from these descriptions; and the arming of the Messiah for battle in <title>Paradise Lost</title> is obviously imitated from the magnificent picture of Zeus summoning all the terrors of his omnipotence for the extirpation of the Titans.</p>
 <p>We have also, under the name of Hesiod, a fragment of 480 lines from a poem entitled the <foreign lang="greek">Ἡρωογονία</foreign> or the genealogy and history of the demigods. To this poem some unknown rhapsodist has attached a piece on the combat between Heracles and Cycnus, containing a description of the hero's shield. It is from this part that the fragment in question bears the title of the <title>Shield of Heracles</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσπὶς Ἡρακλέους</foreign>). Modern crities think that to the <title>Heroögony</title> of Hesiod belonged two works which are cited by the ancients—the one under the title of <title>Catalogue of Women</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Κατάλογος Γυναικῶν</foreign>), a sort of Greek Debrett, giving the history of those mortal women who had become the mothers of demigods, and the other under the title of the <foreign lang="greek">Μεγάλαι Ἠοῖαι</foreign>, so named because the history of each woman or heroine mentioned therein commenced with the words <foreign lang="greek">ἢ οἵη</foreign> (“or such as”). There are scholia on Hesiod by Proclus, John Tzetzes, Moschopulus, and John Protospatharius; but the commentary by Aristophanes of Byzantium is lost. Tzetzes has also left a life of the poet, which is printed in Flach's edition of Hesiod.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑσπερίδες</foreign>). “The Western Maidens,” three celebrated nymphs, whose genealogy is differently given by various writers. According to Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 215), they were the daughters of Night, without a father. Diodorus, on the other hand, makes them to have had for their parents Atlas and Hesperis, daughter of Hesperus ( <bibl n="Diod.  4. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.iv. 27</bibl>), an account which is followed by Milton in his <title>Comus</title> (981). Others, however, to assimilate them to their neighbours the Graiae and Gorgons, call the Hesperides the offspring of Phorcys and Ceto. Apollonius gives their names as Aeglé, Hespera, and Erytheïs <bibl n="A. R. 4.1427" default="NO" valid="yes">(iv. 1427)</bibl>; while Apollodorus, who increases the number to four, calls them Aeglé, Erythea, Hestia, and Arethusa (ii. 5, 11). Hesiod makes them to have dwelt “beyond the bright ocean,” opposite to where Atlas stood supporting the heavens (<title>Theog.</title> 518); and when Atlas had been fixed as a mountain in the extremity of Libya, the dwelling of the Hesperides was usually placed in his vicinity, though some set it in the country of the Hyperboreans (Apollod., l. c.).</p>
 <p>According to the legend, when the bridal of Zeus and Heré took place, the different deities came with nuptial presents for the latter, and among them the goddess of Earth, with branches having golden apples growing on them ( <title>Poet. Astron.</title> ii. 3). Heré, greatly admiring these, begged of Earth to plant them in her gardens, which extended as far as Mount Atlas. The Hesperides, or daughters of Atlas, were directed to watch these trees; but, as they were somewhat remiss in discharging this duty, and frequently plucked off the apples themselves, Heré sent thither a large serpent to guard the precious fruit. This monster was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and had a hundred heads, so that it never slept. According to Pisander, the name of the reptile was Ladon. One of the tasks imposed upon Heracles by Eurystheus was to bring him some of this golden fruit. For the legend, see <ref type="cross" target="crossheracles">Heracles</ref>, p. 791.

<head orig="Hestia">Hestia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑστία</foreign>; Ionic, <foreign lang="greek">Ἰστίη</foreign>). The goddess of the hearth, which is the emblem of the settled home. She was deemed the founder and maintainer of the family and the State, of civic concord and of public reverence for the gods. She was the daughter of Cronus and of Rhea; sister of Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Heré, and Demeter; one of the twelve Olympian deities, from the rest of whom she was distinguished by the fact that, as the abiding goddess of the household, she never left Olympus. In Homer, although the sanctity of the hearth is indeed recognized, as yet we find no mention of the goddess. It is a matter of discussion whether this was by accident, or because in that period the personification of the worship of the hearth had not attained its full perfection. Having been wooed by Apollo and Poseidon, she took an oath of perpetual virginity; so Zeus granted her the honour of being worshipped, as a tutelary goddess, at every hearth, in human habitations as well as in the temples of the gods, and of being called to mind amid libations at the beginning and end of every sacrifice and every festal entertainment. <figure id="fig.00810">
<head orig="Vesta Giustiniani.">Vesta Giustiniani.</head>
</figure> Hence it was that every sacrifice began and ended with a libation to Hestia, so that she had a share in all festivities; and in every prayer, as well as in all the public forms of solemn oaths, her name was recited before the name of any other god. Just as in the home her consecrated hearth formed the central point of family life, at which family festivals were celebrated and where both strangers and fugitives found a hospitable asylum, so also in the prytaneum, or town hall, where the sacred fire was ever burning, her hearth was the centre of the life of the city, indeed of the whole State, and of the colonies which had gone forth from it. Here, as representative of the State, the highest officials sacrificed to her, just as in every private house the father or mother of the family provided for her worship. Here also were held the public deliberations, and the public banquet given to deserving citizens and to foreign ambassadors. Hither repaired all who besought the protection of the State. Hence also the colonists, bound for distant shores, took the fire for the public hearth of their new community. In some respects, the centre of the religious life of Greece was the fire on the hearth of Hestia in the Delphic temple, where was the sacred <foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign> 
<pb n="811" /><cb /> (navel), which the Greeks considered to be the central point of the inhabited earth. Hestia stands in close connection with Zeus as the guardian of the law of hospitality and of the oath. She was also much associated with Hermes and often invoked in conjunction with him; Hestia, as the goddess of quiet domesticity, and Hermes, as the restless god of trade on the public streets and roads, representing between them the two principal varieties of human life. According to a view that afterwards became current, under the influence of philosophers and mystics, she was regarded as personifying the earth, as the fixed centre of the world, and was identified with Demeter and Cybelé. The corresponding deity among the Romans was <ref type="cross" target="crossvesta">Vesta</ref> (q.v.). The statues placed in the prytanea represented her, in accordance with her nature, as a being with grave and yet gentle expression, sitting or standing in an attitude of rest, with a sceptre as her attribute. She is never represented as nude, whence perhaps so few statues of her have been found. The most celebrated of her existing statues is known as the Vesta Giustiniani, in the Torlonia collection at Rome, and ascribed conjecturally to Calamis—a form robed in simple drapery, with hair unadorned and wearing a veil; her right hand rests on her hip, and her left hand, which is pointing upwards, once held a long staff as her sceptre. It represents the earlier Greek conception of divinity, austere and rigid, yet stately and imposing, blending simplicity and severity with grace and tenderness.

 <p>A German classical scholar, born at Chemnitz in Saxony, September 25, 1729. His father was a poor weaver, and for a number of years the son struggled with poverty and disappointment, being sometimes reduced almost to actual starvation. In 1753, however, he secured the position of under-clerk in the Brühl Library at Dresden, and before long published an edition of Tibullus <bibl default="NO">(1755)</bibl>, and one of the <title>Enchiridion</title> of Epictetus <bibl default="NO">(1756)</bibl>, works which won for him the notice of the great Dutch scholar Ruhnken of Leyden. The Seven Years' War occurring at this time unfortunately threw Heyne out of employment, and reduced him to his former straits, his only source of income being the hack-work which he did for the booksellers. This period of want, however, was finally ended by his appointment, through the favour of Ruhnken, to the chair of Eloquence at the University of Göttingen, an office which he held until his death, and in which his profound scholarship and stimulating lectures raised the reputation of Göttingen to an unquestioned pre-eminence among the universities of Germany. It is said that he trained and sent forth more than 130 professors. He died on July 14, 1812. Heyne's principal works are his edition of Vergil <bibl default="NO">(4 vols. 1767, new ed. 1830-44)</bibl>; of Pindar <bibl default="NO">(1773)</bibl>, of Apollodorus <bibl default="NO">(1782, 2d ed. 1802)</bibl>, and of the <title>Iliad</title> in eight vols. <bibl default="NO">(1802)</bibl>. He also put forth a number of translations of the classics; six volumes of miscellanies in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Opuscula Academica</title> (1785-1812)</bibl>; and between 7000 and 8000 book reviews in the <title>Göttinger Gelehrte Anzeiger</title>, of which he was the editor for more than thirty years.

Strabo says that it is too cold to be more than barely habitable; whereas Mela speaks of its herbage as so rich as to cause the cattle to eat until they burst with it. Solinus mentions the fact that there are no snakes in the island, and pictures the inhabitants as so warlike that on the birth of a male child the mother places the first bit of food in its mouth on the point of a sword. Ptolemy gives the names of the rivers and promontories, and describes the outline of the coast with surprising accuracy. He also names the principal tribes of the island—the Vennicnii in Ulster, the Nagnatae in Connaught, the Uterni in Munster, and the Brigantes and others in Leinster. On the coast were two towns—Menapia and Eblana (Dublin). The Romans made no attempt to conquer the island, though they gained some knowledge of it from the British traders who visited its coast.

<head orig="Hiero">Hiero</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱέρων</foreign>). (1) A Sicilian who succeeded his brother Gelon as tyrant of Syracuse, B.C. 478. He committed many acts of violence, encouraged spies, and kept a mercenary guard around his person. He was ambitious of extending his dominion, and his attempts proved successful. After the death of Theron of Agrigentum, Hiero defeated his son Thrasydaeus, who was soon afterwards expelled by his countrymen. He took Naxus and Catana, and, having driven away the inhabitants from both towns, replaced them by Syracusan and Peloponnesian colonists. He changed the name of Catana to Aetna, and he himself assumed the title of Aetnaeus (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰτναῖος</foreign>). Having joined his fleet to that of the people of Cumae, he succeeded in clearing the Tyrrhenian Sea of the Etruscan and other pirates who infested it. His chariots repeatedly won the prize at the Olympic Games, and his success on those occasions formed the theme of several of the odes of Pindar, who was his guest and friend. Aeschylus, Simonides, Bacchylides, and Epicharmus were also well received at the court of Hiero, who was fond of the society of learned men. His intimacy with Simonides is the subject of Xenophon's dialogue entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἱέρων</foreign>. Hiero died at Catana, B.C. 467, and was succeeded by his brother Thrasybulus, who had all his faults without any of his good qualities, and was at last driven away by the Syracusans, who restored the government to the commonwealth ( <bibl n="Diod.  11. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xi. 48</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>(2) The second of the name, son of Hierocles, a wealthy citizen of Syracuse, and a descendant of Gelon, distinguished himself in early life by his brilliant qualities, and served with distinction also under Pyrrhus in his Sicilian campaigns. After Pyrrhus had suddenly abandoned Sicily, the Syracusans found themselves threatened on one side by the Carthaginians and on the other by the Mamertines, a band of Campanian mercenaries, who had treacherously taken possession of Messana. The Syracusan troops, being in want of a trusty leader, chose Hiero by acclamation, and the Senate and citizens, after some demur, ratified the choice, B.C. 275. After various successful operations against the Mamertines, Hiero returned to Syracuse, where, through the influence of Leptines, his father-in-law, a leading man among the aristocratic party, he was proclaimed king, B.C. 270. Shortly afterwards the Mamertines at Messana quarrelled with the Carthaginians, who had managed to introduce a garrison into the citadel, and drove them out, upon which the Carthaginians invited Hiero to join his forces to theirs, in order to drive the Mamertines out of Sicily. Hiero having assented, encamped under the walls of Messana on one side, and the Carthaginians fixed their camp on the other, while their squadron guarded the strait. The Mamertines, meanwhile, had applied to the Romans for assistance, claiming a common origin with them, as being descended from Mars, called Mamers in the Oscan language; and Rome eagerly seized this opportunity of obtaining a footing in Sicily. The consul Appius Claudius marched to Rhegium, and, having contrived to pass the strait in the night unobserved by the Carthaginian cruisers, he surprised Hiero's camp, routed the soldiers, and obliged the <cb /> monarch himself to seek safety in flight. The consul next attacked the Carthaginian camp with the same success, and this was the beginning of the First Punic War, B.C. 265. In the following year the Romans took Tauromenium and Catana and advanced to the walls of Syracuse, when Hiero sued for peace, which he obtained on condition of paying 100 talents of silver and supplying the Roman army with provisions. He punctually fulfilled his engagements, remaining faithful to Rome during the whole of the war, and by his supplies was of great service to the Roman armies, especially during the long sieges of Agrigentum and Lilybaeum. Hiero was included in the peace between Rome and Carthage, by which his territories were <figure id="fig.00813">
<head orig="Coin of Hiero II.">Coin of Hiero II.</head>
</figure> secured to him, and he remained in friendship with both States. He even assisted Carthage at a very critical moment by sending her supplies of provisions during the war which she had to sustain against her mercenaries. The period of peace which elapsed between the end of the First and the beginning of the Second Punic Wars, from B.C. 241 to 218, was most glorious for Hiero and most prosperous for Syracuse. Commerce and agriculture flourished, and wealth and population increased to an extraordinary degree. Hiero paid particular attention to the administration of the finances, and made wise regulations for the collection of the tithe or tax on land, which remained in force throughout Sicily long after his time, and are mentioned with praise by Cicero as the <title>lex Hieronica.</title> Hiero introduced the custom of farming out the tax every year by auction. He embellished and strengthened Syracuse, and built large ships. Archimedes lived under Hiero's reign. When the Second Punic War broke out, Hiero continued true to his Roman alliance, and, after the Trasimenian defeat, he sent a fleet to Ostia with provisions and other gifts, and a body of light troops to the assistance of Rome. He lived to see the battle of Cannae, after which his son Gelon embraced the part of the Carthaginians. Gelon, however, died, not without suspicion of violence, and Hiero himself, being past ninety years of age, ended his days soon afterwards (B.C. 216), leaving the crown to his grandson, Hieronymus.

 <p>(4) A New Platonist, who flourished at Alexandria about the middle of the fifth century A.D. He has left a commentary on the Golden Verses of Pythagoras and a treatise on Providence, Destiny, and Free-will. The aim of Hierocles is to show the agreement which exists in respect of these doctrines between Plato and Aristotle and to refute the systems of Epicurus and the Stoics. We have only extracts from this latter work made by Photius and an abridgment by an unknown hand. Stobaeus has preserved for us fragments of a work of Hierocles on the worship of the gods and of several other productions of his. There exists also, under the name of Hierocles, a collection of amusing anecdotes (<foreign lang="greek">Αστεῖα</foreign>, <title>Facetiae</title>), giving an account of the ridiculous actions and sayings of book-learned men and pedants (<foreign lang="greek">σχολαστικοί</foreign>).

He also wrote two works against Christianity, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Λόγοι Φιλαλήθεις πρὸς τοὺς Χριστιανούς</foreign> (“Truth-loving words to the Christians”), in which, according to Lactantius, he endeavoured to show that the Scriptures overthrow themselves by the contradictions with which they abound. He also reviled Paul, Peter, and the other disciples, as propagators of falsehood. He endeavoured to destroy the effect of the Saviour's miracles, though he did not deny the truth of them. He also aimed to show that like things, or even greater, had been done by Apollonius of Tyana.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερόδουλοι</foreign>, “temple servants”). The name for all who were closely connected with the service of a sanctuary, and especially such as were bound to perform certain services, obligations, and duties to the same, and in part lived as a kind of bondmen upon its land. We find them forming a considerable population in Asia; e. g. at Comana in Cappadocia, there were more than 6000 of them, who with their descendants belonged as slaves to the goddess called Enyo by the Greeks. They served as labourers on the estates of the temple, and performed the humblest offices as hewers of wood and drawers of water. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaedituus">Aedituus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Delphic sanctuary of Apollo had similar ministrants from a very early date, as had also the temple of Aphrodité on Mount Eryx in Sicily. In the same manner Aphrodité of Corinth, in the flourishing times of that city, had over 1000 girls <cb /> dedicated to her service.

<head orig="Hieroglyphics">Hieroglyphics</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερογλυφικὰ</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">γράμματα</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Hieroglyphs</hi> (in Egyptian, called <title>Neter kharu</title> or “divine words”). Pictures of objects used to express either sounds, words, or ideas. Hieroglyphs have been used by several nations, among them the Mexican Aztecs, but the word is oftenest employed of the system of the ancient Egyptians. Their invention in Egypt was ascribed to the god Thoth. Pliny the Elder speaks of Menon as their inventor. There is no evidence that any of the early Greeks acquired an understanding of them, but Philo in his <title>Vita Moysis</title> says that Moses could read them. In Egypt they were universally employed by the educated classes, but were practically a mystery to the people at large, whence a belief in their divine origin prevailed. Democritus of Abdera (B.C. 460), in a work now lost, described both the hieroglyphs of Egypt and the Assyrian cuneiform; and under the Greek rulers of Egypt (after B.C. 300) considerable attention was paid to the language and literature of the country. Under the Romans, Chaeremon, librarian in the Serapeum, compiled a dictionary of hieroglyphs, and they are spoken of by Diodorus, Strabo, Tacitus, Ammian us Marcellinus, Iulius Valerius, and the novelist Heliodorus (about A.D. 400), who in his romance <title>Aethiopica</title>, describes a letter written in hieroglyphs by Queen Candacé. Clemens Alexandrinus (A.D. 211) is the first writer to speak of the twofold nature of the hieroglyphs, which he divides into phonetic and symbolic characters.</p>
 <p>After the sixth century A.D. all knowledge of them was lost until about the beginning of the seventeenth century when the learned Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, endeavoured to interpret them, but had little success owing to his theory that the signs were purely ideographic. That they were at least partly phonetic was asserted by Zoega in 1787, and a certain clue to their decipherment was found in 1799 by the discovery of the celebrated Rosetta Stone during the Napoleonic occupation of Egypt. This is a slab of black basalt inscribed with (1) hieroglyphics;</p>
 <p>(2) demotic (enchorial, cursive), and</p>
 <p>(3) Greek. It gives a decree of the priests of Memphis in honour of Ptolemy V. The labour of many scholars was devoted to the study of these inscriptions. Dr. Young in 1818 partly proved that the characters were alphabetic, a fact surely established in 1822 by the French scholar Champollion, who used for comparison an inscription found on an obelisk at Philae. His methods were subsequently used and his discoveries largely extended by Rosellini, Salvolini <bibl default="NO">(1832)</bibl>, Lepsius <bibl default="NO">(1837)</bibl>, and more recently by Bunsen, De Rougé, Birch, Chabas, Brugsch, and others.</p>
 <p>Hieroglyphs are either ideographic (representing ideas) or phonetic (representing sounds). Phonetic signs are found dating back at least as early as B.C. 3800, and are partly alphabetic and partly syllabic. There are found in the earliest hieroglyphic writing 24 alphabetic signs. In all, there are about 1700 different hieroglyphic characters. Many of them are used as determinatives, that is as signs which aid in determining the meaning of the phonetic symbols which have preceded them. Thus after the phonetic signs for “dog,” is placed a picture of a dog; after those for “tree,” the picture 
<pb n="815" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00815">
<head orig="The Rosetta Stone. (British Museum.)">The Rosetta Stone. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure>
 of a tree, etc. Abstract ideas are expressed by some figures which symbolize them or denote the objects which possess and illustrate them. Thus, “joy” is pictured in a man dancing; “craft” by a jackal, etc. Many of these determinatives get to be largely conventional, as where all actions of moving, standing, or stretching are signified by <foreign lang="greek">Λ</foreign>, originally representing two legs. There are about 150 of these determinative signs in all, and they have their fellows in the cuneiform system of the Assyrians. In the cuneiform, however, the determinatives precede the word and in Egyptian follow it. The Egyptian determinatives are also more numerous and oftener used than the Assyrian.</p>
 <p>There are two cursive or running forms of the hieroglyphs. The first, which is known as the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi>, which was very extensively used, being found in legal and governmental documents, accounts, in nearly all books and rituals, and in private accounts and memoranda. Its characters were fewer in number than the hieroglyphs proper, and the vocalic complements of the consonants are regularly employed to prevent ambiguity. For a specimen of hieratic writing, see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref>, p. 28.</p>
 <p>The second cursive form is known as the <hi rend="italic">demotic</hi>, used as early as the sixth century B.C., and continuing down to the third century A.D. It was the last native form of writing to survive in Egypt, and was gradually supplanted by the characters of the Greek alphabet introduced by the Christians. It appears on the Rosetta Stone side by side with the hieroglyphs. A specimen of it will be found on p. 494.</p>
 <p>The language of the hieroglyphs is best represented by the Coptic, which ceased to be spoken about a century ago, but in which the services of the Egyptian Christians are still conducted. The Coptic forms are largely those of the ancient Egyptian, modified by phonetic decay.</p>
 <p>Hieroglyphs have been found inscribed upon <cb /> granite, porphyry, basalt, and sandstone; and cut or carved on wood and plaster. They were also written upon papyrus and leather. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspapyrus">Papyrus</ref>.) In writing upon papyrus, a reed pen (<hi rend="italic">qash</hi>) was employed. The colours most used were black, red, and green, and the inks were held when in use in a sort of wooden or ivory palette, with holes hollowed out of it as receptacles. On the Ani papyrus in the British Museum, thirteen colours are employed. The characters are written either in horizontal lines or in perpendicular columns, and are read in the order in which the pictures face. See <ref type="cross" target="crossalphabet">Alphabet</ref>.</p>

In 382, in which year he visited Rome and became secretary to Pope Damasus, he began his great version of the Bible into Latin, known as the Vulgate, undertaken at the pope's request. From a linguistic point of view this version is of very great interest, as containing many lexical and grammatical forms not found in the classical language, but peculiar to the popular speech (<seg lang="la">sermo plebeius</seg>). In 386 he fixed his residence at Bethlehem, whither two noble Roman ladies, Paula and her daughter Eustochium, followed him and founded four convents, one of which Jerome himself governed. He died <bibl n="Sept.  30" default="NO" valid="yes">Sept.30</bibl><bibl n="Sept.  420." default="NO" valid="yes">Sept., 420.</bibl>His writings comprise, besides the Vulgate, letters, treatises, and commentaries on the Scriptures.

<head orig="Hierosolyma">Hierosolyma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Ἱεροσόλυμα</foreign>). Jerusalem, a celebrated city of Palestine, the capital of Iudaea. The history of Abraham mentions that Melchizedek, king of Salem, came forth to meet him when he returned from the slaughter of the kings (Gen. xiv. 18), and it has been generally supposed that this Salem was the original of the city which we are now considering. It is more certain, however, that when the Israelites entered Canaan they found the place in the occupation of the Jebusites, a tribe descended from Jebus, a son of Canaan, and the city then bore the name of Jebus or Jebusi (Josh. xv. 63, xviii. 28). The lower city was taken and burned by the children of Judah (Jud. i. 8) after the death of Joshua; but the Jebusites had so strongly fortified themselves in the upper city, on Mount Zion, that they maintained themselves in possession of it till the time of David. That monarch, after his seven years' rule over Judah in Hebron, became king of all Israel, on which he expelled <cb /> the Jebusites from Mount Zion, and established here the metropolis of his kingdom. The city now took the name of Jerusalem (Yerushalaïm), a term which denotes “the abode of peace,” or (according to another derivation) “the people of peace” (Gesenius, <title>Hebr. Lex.</title> s. v.). Yakút, the Mohammedan geographer, gives other forms of the name (Urîshallum, Urishalum, and Shallam). The Septuagint version gives <foreign lang="greek">Ἰερουσαλήμ</foreign> as the form of the name, while by the Greek and Roman writers the place is called Hierosolyma. At present this city is known throughout Western Asia by the Arabic name of El-Kuds, which signifies “The Holy.” See <ref type="cross" target="crosscadytis">Cadytis</ref>.</p>
 <p>Jerusalem was built on several hills, the largest of which was Mount Sion, which formed the southern part of the city. A valley towards the north separated this from Acra, the second or lower city, on the east of which was Mount Moriah, the site of the Temple of Solomon. Northeast of Mount Moriah was the Mount of Olives, on the south was the valley of Hinnom, and at the north Mount Calvary, the scene of Christ's crucifixion.</p>
 <p>Passing over the earlier history of this celebrated city, so fully detailed in the Scriptures, we come to the memorable period of its capture and destruction by Titus. The date of this event was the 8th of September, A.D. 70. During this siege and capture 1,100,000 persons are said to have perished, and 97,000 to have been made prisoners and afterwards either sold for slaves or exposed to the fury of wild beasts. In fact, the population, not only of Jerusalem, but that of the adjacent districts —many who had taken refuge in the city, more who had assembled for the feast of unleavened bread— had been shut up by the sudden formation of the siege. The ardent zeal of the Jewish nation for their holy city and temple soon caused both to be again rebuilt; but fresh commotions compelled the emperor Hadrian to interfere and ordain that no Jew should remain in, or even approach near Jerusalem, on pain of death. On the ruins of their temple the same emperor caused a temple in honour of Iupiter Capitolinus to be erected, and the image of a hog to be cut in stone over the gate leading to Bethlehem, as a standing insult to the religious feelings of this unfortunate people. The name of the city was also changed to Aelia Capitolina, the first part of the name alluding to the family of the Roman emperor. The more peaceful Christians were permitted, however, to establish themselves within the walls, and Aelia became the seat of a flourishing church and bishopric. This latter name became afterwards the ordinary name of the city, and Jerusalem became nearly obsolete. Upon the ascension to the throne, however, of the Christian emperors the earlier name revived. Jerusalem, thus restored, was much less in compass than the ancient city, Mount Sion and Bezetha being excluded.</p>
 <p>The following description of Jerusalem, as it appeared just before the siege by Titus, is taken, with a few alterations, from Dean Milman (<title>History of the Jews</title>, vol. iii. pp. 17 foll.): “Jerusalem, at this period, was fortified by three walls, in all those parts where it was not surrounded by abrupt and impassable ravines; there it had but one. Not that these walls stood one within the other, each in a narrower circle running round the whole city; but each of the inner walls defended one of the several quarters into which 
<pb n="817" /><cb />
 the city was divided, or, it might be almost said, one of the separate cities. Since the days in which David had built his capital on the rugged heights of Sion, great alterations had taken place at Jerusalem. That eminence was still occupied by the upper city; but, in addition, first the hill of Moriah was taken in, on which the temple stood, then Acra, which was originally, although a part of the same ridge, separated by a deep chasm from Moriah. This chasm was almost entirely filled up, and the top of Acra levelled by the Asmonean princes, so that Acra and Moriah were united, though on the side of Acra the temple presented a formidable front, connected by several bridges or causeways with the lower city. To the south the height of Sion, the upper city, was separated from <figure id="fig.00817">
<head orig="View of Jerusalem.">View of Jerusalem.</head>
</figure> the lower by a ravine, which ran right through Jerusalem, called the Tyropoeon, or the valley of the cheesemongers; at the edge of this ravine, on both sides, the streets suddenly broke off, though the walls in some places must have crossed it, and it was bridged in more than one place. To the north extended a considerable suburb called Bezetha, or the new city. The first or outer wall encompassed Bezetha. Agrippa the First had intended to make this wall of extraordinary strength; but he had desisted from the work on the interference of the Romans, who seem to have foreseen that this refractory city would hereafter force them to take up arms against it. Had this wall been built according to the plan of Agrippa, the city, in the opinion of Iosephus, would have been impregnable. <cb /> This wall began at the tower of Hippicus, which stood, it seems, on a point at the extreme corner of Mount Sion. It must have crossed the western mouth of the valley of Tyropoeon, and run directly north to the tower of Psephina. The wall then bore towards the monument of Helena, ran by the royal caverns of the Fuller's Monument, and was carried into the valley of Kedron or Jehoshaphat, where it joined the old or inner wall under the temple. The wall, however it fell short of Agrippa's design, was of considerable strength. The stones were 35 feet long, so solid as not easily to be shaken by battering engines, or undermined. The wall was 17 1/2 feet broad. It had only been carried to the same height by Agrippa, but it had been hastily run up by the Jews to 35 feet; on its top stood battlements 3 1/2 feet high, and pinuacles 5 3/4; so the whole was nearly 45 feet high. The second wall began at a gate in the old or inner one, called Gennath, the gate of the gardens; it intersected the lower city, and, having struck northward for some distance, turned to the east and joined the northwest corner of the tower of Antonia. The Antonia stood at the northwest corner of the temple, and was separated from Bezetha by a deep ditch, which probably protected the whole northern front of the temple as well as of the Antonia. The old or inner wall was that of Sion. Starting from the southwestern porticos of the temple to which it was united, it ran along the ridge of the Tyropoeon, passed first the Xystus, then the council-house, and abutted on the tower 
<pb n="818" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Hippicus, whence the northern wall sprang. The old wall then ran southward through Bethso to the gate of the Essenes, all along the ridge of the valley of Hinnom, above the pool of Siloam, then eastward again to the pool of Solomon, so on through Opha, probably a deep glen. It then joined the eastern portico of the temple. Thus there were, it might seem, four distinct towns, each requiring a separate siege. The capture of the first wall only opened Bezetha; the fortifications of the northern part of the temple, the Antonia, and the second wall still defended the other quarters. The second wall forced, only a part of the lower city was won; the strong rock-built citadel of Antonia and the temple on one hand, and Sion on the other, were not the least weakened. The whole circuit of these walls was guarded with towers, built of the same solid masonry with the rest of the walls. They were 35 feet broad and 35 high; but above this height were lofty chambers, and above those again upper rooms and large tanks to receive the rain-water. Broad flights of steps led up to them. Ninety of these towers stood in the first wall, 14 in the second, and 60 in the third. The intervals between the towers were about 350 feet. The whole circuit of the city, according to Iosephus, was 33 stadia, rather more than 4 miles. The most magnificent of all these towers was that of Psephina, opposite to which Titus encamped. It was 122 1/2 feet high, and commanded a noble view of the whole country of Iudea, to the border of Arabia, and to the sea. It was an octagon. Answering to <figure id="fig.00818">
<head orig="View of the Interior of Jerusalem.">View of the Interior of Jerusalem.</head>
</figure> this was the tower Hippicus, and following the old wall stood those of Phasaëlus and Mariamné, built by Herod, and named after his wife and his brother and friend. These were stupendous, even as works of Hippicus was square, 43 3/4 feet <cb /> each way. The whole height of the tower was 140 feet; the tower itself 52 1/2, a deep tank or reservoir 35, two stories of chambers 43 3/4, battlements and pinnacles 8 3/4. Phasaëlus was a solid square of 70 feet. It was surrounded by a portico 17 1/2 feet high, defended by breastworks and bulwarks, and above the portico was another tower, divided into lofty chambers and baths. It was more richly ornamented than the rest with battlements and pinnacles, so that its whole height was above 167 feet. It looked from a distance like the tall pharos of Alexandria. Mariamné, though not equal in elevation, was more luxuriously fitted up; it was built of solid wall 35 feet high, and of the same width; on the whole, with the upper chambers, it was about 76 3/4 feet high. These lofty towers appeared still higher from their situation. They were built on the old wall, which ran along the steep brow of Sion. Their masonry was perfect. They were built of white marble, cut in blocks 35 feet long, 17 1/2 wide, 8 1/4 high, so fitted that the towers seemed hewn out of the solid quarry. High above the whole city rose the temple, uniting the commanding strength of a citadel with the splendour of a sacred edifice. According to Iosephus, the esplanade on which it stood had been considerably enlarged by the accumulation of fresh soil since the days of Solomon, particularly on the north side. It now covered a square of a furlong on each side. Solomon had faced the precipitous sides of the rock on the east, and perhaps the south, with huge blocks of stone; the other sides likewise had been built up with perpendicular walls to an equal height. These walls in no part were lower than 300 cubits (525 feet), but their whole height was not seen excepting on the eastern and perhaps the southern sides, as the earth was heaped up to the level of the streets of the city. Some of the stones employed in this work were 70 feet square. On this gigantic foundation ran, on each front, a strong and lofty wall without, within a spacious double portico or cloister 52 1/2 feet broad, supported by 162 columns, which upheld a ceiling of cedar, of the most exquisite workmanship. The pillars were entire blocks hewn out of solid marble, of dazzling 
<pb n="819" /><cb />
 whiteness, 43 1/4 feet high. On the south side the portico or cloister was triple. This quadrangle had but one gate to the east, one to the north, two to the south, four to the west; one of these led to the palace, one to the city, one at the corner to the Antonia, one down towards the gardens. The open courts were paved with various inlaid marbles. Between this outer court of the Gentiles and the second court of the Israelites ran rails of stone, but of beautiful workmanship, rather more than 5 feet high. Along these, at regular intervals, stood pillars, with inscriptions in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, warning all strangers, and Jews who were unclean, from entering into the Holy Court beyond. An ascent of fourteen steps led to a terrace 17 1/2 feet wide, beyond which rose the wall of the inner court. This wall appeared on the outside 70 feet, on the inside 43 3/4; for, besides the ascent of 14 steps to the terrace, there were 5 more up to the gates. The inner court had no gate or opening to the west, but four on the north, and four on the south, two to the east, one of which was for the women, for whom a portion of the inner court was set apart, and beyond which they might not advance; to this they had access likewise by one of the northern and one of the southern gates, which were set apart for their use. Around this court ran another splendid range of porticos or cloisters; the columns were quite equal in beauty and workmanship, though not in size, to those of the outer portico. Nine of these gates, or, rather, gateway towers, were richly adorned with gold and silver, on the doors, the door-posts, and the lintels. The doors of each of the nine gates were 52 1/2 feet high, and half that breadth. Within, the gateways were 52 1/2 feet wide and deep, with rooms on each side, so that the whole looked like lofty towers; the height from the base to the summit was 70 feet. Each gateway had two lofty pillars 21 feet in circumference. But what excited the greatest admiration was the tenth, usually called ‘the Beautiful,’ gate of the temple. It was of Corinthian brass of the finest workmanship. The height of the Beautiful Gate was 87 1/2, its doors 70 feet. Within this quadrangle there was a further <cb /> <figure id="fig.00819">
<head orig="Golden Gate of Jerusalem.">Golden Gate of Jerusalem.</head>
</figure> separation, a low wall which divided the priests from the Israelites; near this stood the great brazen altar. Beyond, the temple itself reared its glittering front. The porch or propylon, according to the design of the last, or Herod's temple, extended to a much greater width than the temple itself. In addition to the former width of 105 feet, it had two wings of 35 feet each, making in the whole 175 feet. The great gate of this last quadrangle, to which there was an ascent of twelve steps, was called that of Nicanor. The gateway tower was 132 1/2 feet high, 43 1/2 wide; it had no doors, but the front was covered with gold, and through its spacious arch was seen the Golden Gate of the temple, glittering with the same precious metal, with large plates of which it was sheeted all over. Above this gate hung the celebrated golden vine. This extraordinary piece of workmanship had bunches, according to Iosephus, as large as a man. The Rabbins add that, ‘like a true natural vine, it grew greater and greater; men would be offering—some, gold to make a leaf; some, a grape; some, a bunch; and these were hung up upon it; and so it was increasing continually.’ The temple itself, excepting in the extension of the wings of the propylon, was probably the same in its dimensions and distribution with that of Solomon. Its roof had been set all over, on the outside, with sharp golden spikes, to prevent the birds from settling on and defiling the roof, and the gates were still sheeted with plates of the same splendid metal. At a

A Greek sophist, born at Prusa in Bithynia, about A.D. 315, and educated at Athens, where, after extending his knowledge by travelling, he became a teacher of rhetoric. As such, he was so successful that he received the rights of citizenship and became a member of the Areopagus. Among his pupils were Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus; for, although himself a pagan, nevertheless, like Libanius, he exhibited no animosity against Christians. He was summoned to Antioch by Julian , and appointed his private secretary. On the emperor's death (363), he returned to his earlier occupation at Athens, and there died, after becoming blind in his old age, about 386. Of his speeches and declamations twenty-four exist in a complete form, ten in fragments, and thirty-six in the summaries and excerpts preserved by Photius. His style is ornate, turgid, and overladen with erudition. He owes his special importance solely to the fact that his speeches contain material for the history of the events and of the manners of his time.

 <p>(2) A Greek mathematician, the founder of scientific astronomy. He was born at Nicaea in Bithynia about B.C. 160, lived chiefly at Rhodes and Alexandria, and died about B.C. 120. He discovered the precession of the equinoxes, settled more accurately the length of the solar year, as also of the revolution of the moon, and the magnitude and distances of the heavenly bodies. He placed mathematical geography on a firmer basis, by teaching the application of the latitude and longitude of the stars to marking the position of places on the surface of the earth. He is also regarded as having invented trigonometry. In plane trigonometry he constructed a table of chords of arcs, which is practically the same as one of natural sines; and in spherical trigonometry he had some methods of solving triangles. Of his numerous writings we possess only his commentary on the <title>Phaenomena</title> of Eudoxus and Aratus and a catalogue of 1026 fixed stars.

<div2 id="crosshippeis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hippeis">Hippeis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱππεῖς</foreign>). The Greek term for horsemen and knights. (1) Among the Athenians, the citizens whose property qualified them for the second class.</p>
 <p>(2) Among the Spartans, the royal guard of honour, consisting of 300 picked young men under the age of thirty, who, although originally mounted, afterwards served as heavy-armed footsoldiers.</p>
 <p>The cavalry of Athens, which was first formed after the Persian War, and then consisted of 300 men, from the time of Pericles onwards consisted of 1200 men—viz. 200 mounted bowmen (<foreign lang="greek">ἱπποτόξοται</foreign>), who were slaves belonging to the State, and the 1000 citizens of the two highest classes. They were kept together in time of peace, and carefully drilled; at the great public festivals they took part in the processions. They were commanded by two <foreign lang="greek">ἵππαρχοι</foreign>, each of whom had five <foreign lang="greek">φυλαί</foreign> under him and superintended the levy. Subordinate to these were the ten <foreign lang="greek">φύλαρχοι</foreign> in command of the ten phylae. Both sets of officers were drawn from the two highest classes. It was the duty of the council to see that the cavalry was in good condition, and also to examine new members in respect of their equipment and their eligibility.</p>
 <p>The number of horsemen to be despatched to the field was determined by the decree of the popular assembly. Every citizen-soldier received equipment-money on joining, and during his time of service a subsidy towards keeping a groom and two horses; this grew to be an annual grant from the State, amounting to forty talents ($10,400 in intrinsic value), but regular pay was only given in the field.</p>
 <p>At Sparta it was not until B.C. 404 that a regular body of horse was formed, the cavalry being much neglected as compared with the infantry. The rich had only to provide horses, equipment, and armour; for the actual cavalry service in time of war, only those unfitted for the heavy-armed infantry were drafted off and sent to the field without any preliminary drill. In later times every <foreign lang="greek">μόρα</foreign> of heavy-armed infantry seems to have had allotted to it a <foreign lang="greek">μόρα</foreign> of cavalry, of uncertain number. By enlisting mercenaries and introducing allies into their forces, the Spartans at length obtained better cavalry.</p>
 <p>The utility of the Greek citizen-cavalry was small on account of their heavy armour, their metal helmet, and their coat of mail, their kilt fringed with metal flaps, their cuisses reaching to the knee, and their leather leggings. They did not take shields into action. As weapons of offence they had the straight two-edged sword and a spear, used either as a lance or a javelin. Shoeing of horses was unknown to the Greeks, as was also the use of stirrups. If anything at all was used as a saddle, it was either a saddle-cloth or a piece of felt, which was firmly fastened with girths under the horse's belly.</p>
 <p>The Thessalians were considered the best riders. Cavalry became really important for the first time in the Macedonian army under Philip and his son 
<pb n="822" /><cb /> Alexander the Great. Although in earlier times the number of horsemen in the Greek forces was only very small, in the army which Alexander marched into Asia they formed nearly a sixth part of the infantry. The Macedonian cavalry was divided into heavy and light, both consisting of squadrons (<foreign lang="greek">ἶλαι</foreign>) of an average strength of 200 men. Of the heavy cavalry the choicest troops were the Macedonian and Thessalian horsemen, armed in the Greek fashion, who were as formidable in onslaught as in single combat; in order and discipline they far surpassed the dense squadrons of the Asiatic cavalry, and even in attacking the infantry of the enemy they had generally a decisive effect. The light cavalry, which was constituted under the name of <foreign lang="greek">πρόδρομοι</foreign> (skirmishers), consisted of Macedonian <foreign lang="greek">σαρισσοφόροι</foreign>, so called from the <hi rend="italic">sarissa</hi>, a lance from fourteen to sixteen feet long (Polyb. xviii. 12), and of Thracian horsemen. The heavy cavalrymen had each a mounted servant and probably a led horse for the transport of baggage and forage. In the time after Alexander there came into existence what were called the <title>Tarentini equites</title>, or light-armed spearmen, with two horses each (B.C. 192, <bibl n="Liv.  35. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxv. 28</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 29</bibl>).

 <p>(2) A famous Greek physician, was born in the island of Cos (an ancient seat of the worship of Asclepius), about B.C. 460. He was the son of Heraclides and of Phaenareté, and sprang from the race of the Asclepiadae, a priestly family, who in the course of time had gathered and preserved medical traditions, <figure id="fig.00822.2">
<head orig="Hippocrates. (Louvre.)">Hippocrates. (Louvre.)</head>
</figure> which were secretly handed down from father to son. Like many of the Asclepiadae, he practised his art while travelling in different parts of Greece. He is said to have been at Athens at the time of the Peloponnesian War, and to have taken advantage of the instructions of the sophists Gorgias and Prodicus; Democritus of Abdera is also 
<pb n="823" /><cb />
 named as one of his teachers. The value he himself set upon philosophic education is proved by his remark that “a philosophic physician resembles a god.” Towards the end of his life he lived chiefly in Thessaly and on the island of Thasos. He died about B.C. 377 (or later) in the Thessalian Larissa, where his tomb was to be seen as late as the second century A.D. All through his long life his activity was unceasing in its efforts to increase the amount of his knowledge on all subjects, by both practical and theoretical investigations, and his practical knowledge was as great as his theoretical. Some of his fragments and epigrammatic dicta have passed into the literature of all time, as, for instance, the famous saying, “Life is short, and Art is long.” He was the founder of the school of a scientific art of healing, and, as in the case of Homer, numerous writings of unknown authorship, proceeding from the school which followed his system, were attributed to him. Seventy-two works, great and small, in the Ionic and old Attic dialects, bear his name, and, apparently, formed a single collection, even before they came under the consideration of the critics of Alexandria. But it is clear that, as the ancients themselves were aware, only a small portion, which can no longer be precisely defined, really belongs to him. It is highly probable that his nearest relations, who were also distinguished physicians, contributed their share to the collection, and that it contains works by his sons Thessalus and Dracon, his sonin-law Polybus, and his two grandsons, the sons of Thessalus and Dracon, who bore his own name. The best known of these works are the aphorisms (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀφορισμοί</foreign>), which, in antiquity and in mediaeval times, were held in high esteem, and have been freely commented on by Greeks, Romans, and Arabs; they consist of short sentences upon the nature of illnesses, their symptoms and crises, and their final issue. One of his treatises (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ἀέρων, Ὑδάτων, Τόπων</foreign>), which is of general interest, and is in all respects among the best, is that on the influence of the climate, the water, and the configuration of a country upon the physical and intellectual life of its inhabitants. In the second portion of this work are found the first beginnings of a comparative ethnography, which at once surprise us by the acuteness and intelligence of its observation, and attracts us by the simplicity and clearness of its style. Many ancient physicians wrote commentaries on the works of Hippocrates, the most celebrated being those of Galen.</p>

<div2 id="crosshippodromus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hippodrŏmus">Hippodromus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱππόδρομος</foreign>). The name by which the Greeks designated the place appropriated to the horse-races, both of chariots and of single horses, which formed a part of their games. The word was also applied to the races themselves.</p>
 <p>The mode of fighting from chariots, as described by Homer, involves the necessity of much previous practice; and the funeral games in honour of Patroclus present us with an example of the chariotrace, occupying the first and most important place in those games ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 262" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 262</bibl>-650). In this vivid description the nature of the contest and the arrangements for it are very clearly indicated. There is no artificially constructed hippodrome; but an existing landmark or monument (<foreign lang="greek">σῆμα</foreign>) is chosen as the goal (<foreign lang="greek">τέρμα</foreign>), round which the chariots had to pass, leaving it on the left hand, and so returning to the Greek ships on the sea-shore, from which they had started. The course thus marked out was so long that the goal, which was the stump of a tree, could only be clearly seen by its having two white stones leaning against it, and that, as the chariots return, the spectators are uncertain which is first (450 foll.: the passage furnishes a precedent for betting at a horse-race, 485). The ground is a level plain, but with its natural inequalities, which are sufficient to make the light chariots leap from the ground, and to threaten an overthrow where the earth was broken by a winter torrent, or a collision in the narrow hollow way thus formed. The chariots were five in number, each with two horses and a single driver, who stood upright in his chariot. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurrus">Currus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In a race of this nature, success would obviously depend quite as much on the courage and skill of the driver as on the speed of the horses. At starting, it was necessary so to direct the horses as, on the one hand, to avoid the loss of time by driving wide of the straightest course, and on the other not to incur the risk of a collision in the crowd of chariots, nor to make so straight for the goal as to leave insufficient room to turn it. Here was the critical point of the race, to turn the goal as sharply as possible, with the nave of the near wheel almost grazing it, and to do this safely; 
<pb n="824" /><cb />
 very often the driver was here thrown out, and the chariot broken in pieces. There was another danger at this point, which deserves particular notice as connected with the arrangements of the hippodrome of later times. As the horse is easily scared, it can readily be understood that the noise and crush of many chariots turning the goal together, with the additional confusion created by the overthrow of some of them, would so frighten some of the horses as to make them unmanageable; and this is expressly referred to by Homer. Among the other disasters to which the competitors were liable were: the loss of the whip; the reins escaping from the hands; the breaking of the pole; the light chariot being overturned, or the driver thrown out of it, through the roughness of the ground, or by neglecting to balance the body properly in turning the goal, and the being compelled to give way to a bolder driver, for fear of a collision; but it was considered foul play to take such an advantage. The prizes, as in the other Homeric games, were of substantial value, and one for each competitor. The charioteer accused of foul play was required to lay his hand upon his horses, and to swear by Poseidon, the patron deity of the race, that he was guiltless. This description is shown by the following illustration from an antique Greek vase, in which is seen the goal as a mere stone post, with a fillet wound round it; the form of the chariots and the attitude of the drivers is well shown; each has four horses, as in the earliest Olympic chariot-race; and the vividness of the representation is increased by the introduction of the incident of a horse having got loose from the first chariot, the driver of which strives to retain his place with the others (Panofka, <title>Bilder antiken Lebens</title>, pl. iii. No. 10).</p>
 <p>In no other writer is there a description, at once so vivid and so minute, of the Greek chariotrace as this of Homer's; and it may be safely assumed that, with a few points of difference, it will give an equally good idea of a chariot-race at Olympia or any other of the great games of later times. The chief points of difference were the greater compactness of the course, in order that a large body of spectators might view the race with convenience, and the greater number of chariots. The first of these conditions involved the necessity of making the race consist of several double lengths of the course, instead of only one; the second required some arrangement by which the chariots <figure id="fig.00824">
<head orig="Chariot-race. (From a Vase-painting.)">Chariot-race. (From a Vase-painting.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> might start without confusion and on equal terms. It is now to be seen how these conditions were satisfied in the hippodrome at Olympia, of which the only description we possess is in two passages of Pausanias (v. 15. 4; vi. 20. 7 foll.).</p>
 <p>The following is the ground-plan which Hirt (pl. xx. fig. 8) has drawn out from the description <figure id="fig.00824.2">
<head orig="Ground-plan of Hippodrome at Olympia. (Hirt. )">Ground-plan of Hippodrome at Olympia. (Hirt. )</head>
</figure> of Pausanias: A, B, the sides; C, the rounded end of the hippodrome, with raised seats for the spectators (the dotted line D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the axis of the figure); <seg lang="la">a</seg>, place of honour for the magistrates and musicians; <seg lang="la">b</seg>, side door, perhaps for the exit of disabled chariots and horses; <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, seats for the Hellanodicae, the judges of the games; <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, principal entrance, corresponding to the <seg lang="la">porta triumphalis</seg> in a Roman circus; D, the starting-place; <seg lang="la">e</seg>, its apex; <hi rend="italic">f, g</hi>, its curved sides; <seg lang="la">h, i</seg>, etc., up to <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, stations of the chariots, their directions converging towards the point E; F, G, the goals, or turningposts; H, the spina; <hi rend="italic">p, p</hi>, small intervals between the spina and the goals; <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, the winning line; <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, dolphin used as a signal; <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, altar, with eagle for signal; <seg lang="la">o, o, o</seg>, portico of Agnaptus.</p>
 <p>The general form of the hippodrome was an oblong, with a semicircular end, C, and with the right side, A, somewhat longer than the left, B, for a reason to be stated presently. The right side, A, was formed by an artificial mound; the left, B, by the natural slope of a hill. The base of the fourth side, D, was formed by the portico of Agnaptus, so called from its builder. At this end of the hippodrome was the starting-place (<foreign lang="greek">ἄφεσις</foreign>), in the form of the prow of a ship, with its apex, <seg lang="la">e</seg>, towards the area, and each of its sides more than 400 feet long. Along both of these sides were stalls (<foreign lang="greek">οἰκήματα</foreign>) for the chariots about to start, like the <seg lang="la">carceres</seg> in the Roman circus; and it was in the arrangement of these stalls that the peculiarity of the Greek starting-place consisted. According to the view which we follow, the stalls were so arranged as that the pole of each chariot, while standing in its stall, was directed to a normal point E, at which, as nearly as possible, each chariot ought to fall into its proper course. As this point, E, was necessarily on the right side of

 the area (in order to turn the goal on the left hand), and as the corresponding stalls on each side were required to be equidistant from the apex, <seg lang="la">e</seg> (as will presently be seen), and of course also from the point E, it follows that the base of the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi> must have been perpendicular to the line E <seg lang="la">e</seg>, and therefore oblique to the axis D <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> and this is the reason why the side A was longer than the side B. The curvature of the sides of the aphesis, <hi rend="italic">f, g</hi>, is a conjectural arrangement, assumed as that which was probably adopted to give more space to each chariot at starting. The front of each stall had a cord drawn across it, and the necessary arrangements were made for letting these cords fall at the right moments. On the signal being given for the race to begin, the cords in front of the two extreme stalls, <hi rend="italic">h, h</hi>, were let fall simultaneously, and the two chariots started; then those of the next pair; and so on, each pair of chariots being liberated at the precise moment when those which had already started came abreast of their position; and when all the chariots formed an even line abreast of the apex of the <seg lang="la">aphesis, e</seg>, it was a fair start. This arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi> was the invention of the statuary Cleoetas, and was improved by Aristeides, perhaps the famous painter.</p>
 <p>Precisely the same arrangements were made for the start in the race of single horses (<foreign lang="greek">κέλητες</foreign>); and in both cases, as in the race described by Homer, the stalls were assigned to the competitors by lot. How many chariots usually started cannot be determined, but that the number was large is proved by the well-known story that Alcibiades alone sent to one race seven chariots. Sophocles (<title>Elect.</title> 701-708) mentions ten chariots as running at once in the Pythian games; and the number at Olympia was no doubt greater than at any of the other games. This is probably the reason why the arrangements of a starting-place were so much more complicated in the Greek hippodrome than they were in the Roman circus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscircus">Circus</ref>.) About the centre of the triangular area of the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi> there was an altar, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, of rough brick, which was plastered afresh before each festival, surmounted by a bronze eagle with outstretched wings; and above the apex of the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi> was a bronze dolphin, <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> As the signal for the race to begin, the eagle was made to soar aloft, so as to be seen by all the spectators, and the dolphin sank to the ground. <cb /></p>
 <p>The chariots, thus started, had to pass several times round two goals (<foreign lang="greek">νύσσαι</foreign>), the distinction between which is one of the difficult points in the description of Pausanias. On the whole, it seems most probable that the one which he describes as having a bronze statue of Hippodameia holding out the victor's fillet as if about to crown Pelops with it, was the one nearer to the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi>, and abreast of the winning line, F; and that the other, G, round which the chariots made their first turn, was that which Pausanias calls “Taraxippus, the terror of the horses.” This was a round altar, dedicated to Taraxippus, who was supposed to strike a supernatural terror into the horses as they passed the spot, and whom, therefore, the charioteers sought to propitiate, before the race began, by offering sacrifices and making vows at this altar. Pausanias gives various accounts as to who this Taraxippus was; some modern scholars take the word for an appellation of Poseidon Hippius. He was similarly honoured in the Isthmian hippodrome. At Nemea there was no such hero, but above the turning-point of the course there was a bright-red rock, which was supposed to frighten the horses. There are several vasepaintings on which chariots or single horses are exhibited turning the goal, which is represented as a Doric or Ionic column. (See Panofka, <title>Bilder antiken Lebens</title>, pl. iii.) One of these is shown in the following illustration, which exhibits a vivid picture of a race of single horses. The last rider has been unlucky in turning the goal.</p>
 <p>There is no authority in the account of Pausanias for the connecting wall, H, between the goals, nor does he state that the winning line, <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, was marked out as a white line; but these details are inserted from the analogy of the Roman circus. So also is the oblique position of the line of the goals, as compared with the axis of the figure: of course the greatest space was required at E, where the chariots were all nearly abreast of each other.</p>
 <p>Respecting the dimensions of the Olympic Hippodrome there is no precise information; but from the length of the measure called <foreign lang="greek">ἵππικον</foreign> and on other grounds, it seems probable that the distance from the starting-place to the goal, or perhaps, rather, from one goal to the other, was two stadia, so that one double course was four stadia. How many such double courses made up the whole race is not known. The width must have been at least as great as the length of each side of the <hi rend="italic">aphesis</hi>—namely, more than 400 feet.</p>
 <p>The chief points of difference between the Greek hippodrome and the Roman circus are the smaller width of the latter, as only four chariots ran at <figure id="fig.00825.2">

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππόλυτος</foreign>). The Joseph of classical literature, a son of Theseus and Hippolyté, or, according to others, of Theseus and Antiopé. Theseus, after the death of his first wife, married Phaedra, the daughter of Minos and sister of Ariadné. This princess was seized with a criminal affection for the son of the Amazon, an affection produced by the wrath of Aphrodité against Hippolytus for neglecting her divinity and for devoting himself solely to the service of Artemis; or else against Phaedra as the daughter of <ref type="cross" target="crosspasiphae">Pasiphaë</ref> (q.v.). During the absence of Theseus, the queen made advances to her step-son, which were indignantly rejected. Filled with fear and hate, on the return of her husband she accused Hippolytus of an attempt on her honour. Without giving the youth an opportunity of clearing himself, the monarch, calling to mind that Poseidon had promised him the accomplishment of any three wishes that he might form, cursed and implored destruction on his son from the god. As Hippolytus, leaving Troezen, was driving his chariot along the seashore, a monster, sent by Poseidon from the deep, terrified his horses; they burst away in fury, heedless of their driver, dashed the chariot to pieces, and dragged along Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, until he died. Phaedra ended her days by her own hand; and Theseus, when too late, learned the innocence of his son. Euripides has founded his tragedy, <title>Hippolytus</title>, on this subject, but the legend assumes a somewhat different shape with him. According to the plot of his play, Phaedra hangs herself in despair when she finds that she is slighted by her step-son, and Theseus, on his return from his travels, finds, when taking down her corpse, a writing attached to it, in which Phaedra accused Hippolytus of having attempted her honour. According to another legend, Aesculapius restored Hippolytus to life, and Artemis transported him, under the name of Virbius, to Italy, where he was worshipped in the grove of Aricia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvirbius">Virbius;</ref> <bibl n="Apollod.  3.10.3." default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.10.3.</bibl>) The story of Hippolytus forms the subject of a play by Euripides with that title, of a Latin tragedy by Seneca, and the <title>Phèdre</title> of Racine.

At Clazomenae, two sculptors, Bupalus ( <bibl n="Hor.

 <p>A friend of Caesar, and one of his companions in arms as in politics. In B.C. 58 he was Caesar's legate in Gaul, was praetor in 46, and consul in 43, when, acting for Octavian, he defeated Antony at Mutina. He completed Caesar's <title>Commentarii de Bello Gallico</title> by adding an eighth book ( <title>Iul.</title> 56). According to the dedication to Cornelius Balbus prefixed to that book, he contemplated the continuation of Caesar's account of the Civil War to Caesar's death. This intention he never carried out, as he fell in battle at Mutina, April 27, B.C. 43, when he was consul. Of the three works, the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum, Bellum Africanum</title>, and <title>Bellum Hispaniense</title>, which have come down to us with Caesar's commentaries, the first may have been written by him. Of the other two, it has been conjectured that they were composed at his request, in preparation for his intended work on military commanders, and that having been found at his death among his papers, they were added, with his own writings, to the works of Caesar himself. A short letter of Hirtius to Cicero is found in <title>Ad Att.</title> xv. 6.

<div2 id="crosshispania" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hispania">Hispania</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱσπανία</foreign>). An extensive country, forming a kind of peninsula, in the southwest of Europe; the modern Spain and Portugal. It was bounded on the north by the Pyrenees and Sinus Cantabricus or Bay of Biscay, on the west by the Atlantic, on the south by the Atlantic, Fretum Herculeum or Strait of Gibraltar, and the Mediterranean, which last bounds it also on the east. By the Romans, Spain was represented by the figure of a woman with a rabbit at her side. The Romans borrowed the name Hispania, appending <cb /> their own termination to it, from the Phoenicians, through whom they first became acquainted with the country. The Greeks called it <foreign lang="greek">Ἰβηρία</foreign> (Lat. Iberia), but attached at different periods different ideas to the name. Up to the time of the Achaean League and their more intimate acquaintance with the Romans, they understood by this name all the sea-coast from the Pillars of Hercules to the mouth even of the Rhodanus (Rhone) in Gaul (Polyb. iii. 37). The coast of Spain on the Atlantic they called Tartessis ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 163" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 163</bibl>). The interior of the country they termed Celticé (<foreign lang="greek">Κελτική</foreign>), a name which they applied, in fact, to the whole northwestern part of Europe. The Greeks in after-ages understood by Iberia the whole of Spain. The name Iberia is derived from the Iberi (<foreign lang="greek">Ἴβηρες</foreign>) of whom the Greeks had heard as one of the most powerful nations of the country. The Roman poets called the country Hesperia Ultima. For a map of Hispania, see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossprovincia">Provincia</ref>.</p>
 <p>The origin of the ancient population of Spain is altogether uncertain. The Iberi, according to the ancient writers, were divided into six tribes; the Cynetes, Gletes, Tartessii, Elbysinii, Mastieni, and Calpiani. Diodorus Siculus (v. 31 foll.) mentions the invasion of Spain by the Kelts. The Iberi made war against them for a long time, but, after an obstinate resistance on the part of the natives, the two people entered into an agreement, according to which they were to possess the country in common, bear the same name, and remain forever united; such, says the same historian, was the origin of the Celtiberi in Spain. These warlike people, continues Diodorus, were equally formidable as cavalry and infantry; for, when the horse had broken the enemy's ranks, the men dismounted and fought on foot. Their dress consisted of a <seg lang="la">sagum</seg>, or coarse woollen mantle; they wore greaves made of hair, an iron helmet adorned with a red feather, a round buckler, and a broad two-edged sword, of so fine a temper as to pierce through the enemy's armour. Although they boasted of cleanliness in both their food and dress, it was not unusual for them to wash their teeth and bodies with urine, a custom which they considered favourable to health. Wine was brought into the country by foreign merchants. The land was equally distributed, and the harvests were divided among all the citizens; the law punished with death the person who appropriated more than his just share. They sacrificed human victims to their divinities, and the priests pretended to read future events by inspecting the entrails. At every full moon they celebrated the festival of a god without a name; from this circumstance, their religion has been considered a sort of deism.</p>
 <p>The Phoenicians were the first people who established colonies on the coast of Spain. Tartessus was perhaps the most ancient; at a later period they founded Gades (Cadiz). They carried on there a very lucrative trade, inasmuch as the country was unknown to other nations; but, in time, the Rhodians, the Samians, the Phocaeans, and other Greeks established settlements on different parts of the coast. Carthage had been founded by the Phoenicians; but the inhabitants, regardless of their connection with that people, took possession of the Phoenician stations, and conquered the whole of maritime Spain. The government of these people was still less supportable. The Carthaginians were unable to form any friendly intercourse with the 
<pb n="828" /><cb /> Spaniards in the interior. The ruin of Carthage paved the way for new invaders, and Spain was considered a Roman province two centuries before the Christian era. Those who had been the allies became masters of the Spaniards, and the manners, customs, and even language of the conquerors were introduced into the peninsula. But Rome paid dearly for her conquest; the north—or the present Old Castile, Aragon, and Catalonia—was constantly in a state of revolt. The mountaineers shook off the yoke, and it was not before the reign of Augustus that the country was wholly subdued.</p>
 <p>The peninsula was then divided into <hi rend="SmallCaps">Hispania Citerior</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Hispania Ulterior</hi>. Hispania Citerior was also called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tarraconensis</hi>, from Tarraco, its capital, and extended from the foot of the Pyrenees to the mouth of the Durius (Douro), on the Atlantic shore; comprehending all the north of Spain, together with the south as far as a line drawn below Carthago Nova (Carthagena), and continued in an oblique direction to Salamantica (Salamanca), on the Durius. Hispania Ulterior was divided into two provinces, Baetica, on the south of Spain, between the Anas (Guadiana) and Citerior, and above it Lusitania, corresponding in a great degree, though not entirely, to Portugal. In the age of Diocletian and Constantine, Tarraconensis was subdivided into a province towards the limits of Baetica, and adjacent to the Mediterranean, called Carthaginiensis, from its chief city Carthago Nova, and another, north of Lusitania, called Gallaecia from the Callaici. The province of Lusitania was partly peopled by the Cynetes or Cynesii. The Celtici possessed the land between the Anas and the Tagus. The Lusitani, a nation of freebooters, were settled in the middle of Estremadura. The part of Baetica near the Mediterranean was peopled by the Bastuli Poeni. The Turduli inhabited the shores of the ocean, near the mouth of the Baetis. The Baeturi dwelt on the Montes Mariani, and the Turdetani inhabited the southern slope of the Sierra de Aracena. The last people, more enlightened than any other in Baetica, were skilled in different kinds of industry long before their neighbours. When the Phoenicians arrived on their coasts, silver was so common among them that their ordinary utensils were made of it. The people in Gallaecia, a subdivision of Tarraconensis, were the Artabri, who derived their name from the promontory of Artabrum, now Cape Finisterre; the Bracari, whose chief town was Bracara, the present Braga; and lastly the Lucenses, the capital of whose country was Lucus Augusti, now Lugo. These tribes and some others formed the nation of the Callaici or Callaeci. The Astures, now the Asturians, inhabited the banks of the Asturis, or the country on the east of the Gallaecian mountains. Their capital was Asturica Augusta, now Astorga. The Vaccaei, the least barbarous of the Celtiberians, cultivated the country on the east of the Astures. The fierce Cantabri occupied Biscay and part of Asturias. The Vascones, the ancestors of the present Gascons, were settled on the north of the Iberus or Ebro. The Iacetani were scattered over the Pyrenaean declivities of Aragon. The Ilergetes resided in the country round Lerida. As to the country on the east of these tribes, the whole of Catalonia was peopled by the Ceretani, Indigetes, Ausetani, Cosetani, and others. The lands on the south of the Ebro were inhabited by <cb /> the Arevaci and Pelendones; the former were so called from the river Areva; they were settled in the neighbourhood of Arevola, and in the province of Segovia: the latter possessed the high plains of Soria and Moncayo. The space between the mountains of Albaracino and the river was peopled by the Edetani, one of the most powerful tribes of Spain. The Ilercaones, who were not less formidable, inhabited an extensive district between the upper Jucar and the lower Ebro. The country of the Carpetani, or the space from the Guadiana to the Somo-Sierra, forms at present the archiepiscopal see of Toledo. The people on the south of the last were the Oretani, between the Guadiana and the Montes Mariani; and the Olcades, a small tribe near the confluence of the Gabriel and Jucar. Hispania Carthaginiensis, a subdivision of Tarraconensis, was inhabited by two tribes: the Bastitani, in the centre of Murcia, and the Contestani, who possessed the two banks of the Segura, near the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
 <p>Under the Romans all the arts of Latin civilization flourished. Latin was spoken by the educated, and many of the great writers of the Silver Age were Spaniards—Martial, Seneca, Quintilian, Lucan, Silius Italicus, Columella, Pomponius Mela, as also Prudentius and Isidorus in later times. The emperor Trajan was of Spanish birth.</p>
 <p>The different tribes were confounded while the Romans governed the country; but, in the beginning of the fifth century, the Suevi, Vandals, and Visigoths invaded the Peninsula, and, mixing with the Kelts and Iberians, produced the different races which the ethnologist still observes in Spain. The first-mentioned people, or Suevi, descended the Durius under the leadership of Ermeric, and chose Braga for the capital of their kingdom. Genseric led his Vandals to the centre of the peninsula, and fixed his residence at Toletum (Toledo); but fifteen years had not elapsed after the settlement of the barbarous horde when Theodoric, conquered by Clovis, abandoned Tolosa (Toulouse), penetrated into Spain, and compelled the Vandals to fly into Africa. During the short period that the Vandals remained in the country, the ancient province of Baetica was called Vandalusia, and all the country, from the Ebro to the Strait of Gibraltar, submitted to them. The ancient Celtiberians, who had so long resisted the Romans, made then no struggle for liberty or independence; they yielded without resistance to their new masters. Powers and privileges were the portion of the Gothic race, and the title of <title>hijo del Goda</title>, or “son of the Goth,” which the Spaniards changed into <hi rend="italic">hidalgo</hi>, became the title of a noble or a free and powerful man among a people of slaves. A number of petty and almost independent States were formed by the chiefs of the conquering tribes; but the barons or freemen acknowledged a liege lord. Spain and Portugal were thus divided, and the feudal system established.</p>

<head orig="Historia">Historia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστορία</foreign>, “investigation”). <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>. —The composition of history, and indeed of all forms of prose composition among the Greeks, originated with the Ionians of Asia Minor, who also created the epos, the elegy, and iambic poetry. It was among them, in the sixth century B.C., that the <ref type="cross" target="crosslogographi">Logographi</ref> (q.v.) made their appearance. These writers treated the materials supplied by family traditions and local legends in a style which gradually approached more and more to prose, but without any attempt at critical investigation or scientific arrangement. The most important writers in this style and also its latest representatives were Hecataeus of Miletus and Hellanicus of Lesbos. The latter was a contemporary of Herodotus of Halicarnassus (about B.C. 485-424), called by Cicero the Father of History. His work, also written in the Ionic dialect, was founded upon a vast collection of historical and geographical material gathered in his extensive travels, and through the researches of many years. This mass of information he, with great art, moulded into a homogeneous work, the leading theme of which is the struggle of the Greeks against the barbarians. The narrative is simple, but always attractive. See <ref type="cross" target="crossherodotus">Herodotus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The line of historians who wrote in the Attic dialect is headed by the Athenian Thucydides, whose history of the Peloponnesian War is a masterpiece of the first order, noble alike in style and in matter. A continuation of Thucydides was written by his countryman Xenophon (about B.C. 431-355) in his <title>Hellenica.</title> In his <title>Anabasis</title>, Xenophon described the famous retreat of the Ten Thousand in a style which won for him the name of “the Attic Bee.” In the <title>Cyropaedia</title> he gives a picture, much idealized, but not without a foundation of fact, of the history of the Persian Cyrus. His contemporary Ctesias of Cnidus, writing in Ionic Greek, introduced his countrymen to the formal history of the Persian Empire. At the same time Philistus of Syracuse, an imitator of Thucydides, compiled the history of Sicily from the earliest times down to his own. In the second half of the fourth century B.C. appeared two celebrated historians, Theopompus of Chios and Ephorus of Cymé, both disciples of the rhetorician Isocrates. The chief work of Theopompus was a history of Philip of Macedon, from his accession to his death. Ephorus, in a great work embracing the whole course of events from the invasion of the Peloponnesus by the Heraclidae, to B.C. 345, was the first writer who attempted a universal history. To this period belong the numerous chronicles of Attic history, called <title>Atthides.</title> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossatthis">Atthis</ref>.) In these, comparatively little regard was paid to style—less, certainly, than was paid by the historians just mentioned as succeeding Xenophon.</p>
 <p>The period of Alexander the Great and his successors was very fertile in historical writing. One may mention Callisthenes, Aristobulus, Chares , Onesicritus, Clitarchus, and Hieronymus, who narrated contemporary events in a style sometimes plain and simple, and sometimes rhetorically exaggerated. This was the age of the Sicilian Timaeus, whose great work on the history of his native island, in some forty books, won him little recognition, but who simplified chronology by introducing the method of reckoning by Olympiads, and thus established a lasting claim on the gratitude of historians. <cb /> Among the better histories should be named also the great work of Phylarchus (about B.C. 210), which began with the invasion of the Peloponnesus by Pyrrhus, and ended with the death of Cleomenes.</p>
 <p>The Alexandrian scholar Eratosthenes conferred a great boon on scientific historical investigation by his attempt to place chronology on the firm foundation of mathematics and astronomy. His labours were continued by Apollodorus, whose <title>Chronica</title> was the most important work on chronology produced in antiquity. This was a brief enumeration of the most important events, from the taking of Troy <bibl default="NO">(by him assigned to the year B.C. 1183)</bibl> down to his own time (B.C. 144). Only isolated fragments of the histories written after Xenophon have, in the greater number of instances, come down to us; but we have a considerable part of the work of Polybius of Megalopolis, who died about 122. This was a general history of the known world from the beginning of the Second Punic War to the destruction of Carthage. Its style has no just claim to artistic merit, but its contents make it one of the most remarkable of ancient Greek histories. About the year B.C. 40, the Sicilian writer Diodorus compiled a valuable general history from the works of Greek and Roman writers now lost. Of this a considerable part still remains. Nicolaüs of Damascus, who lived a little later, was the author of a great general history, in 144 books, of which we have considerable fragments. Dionysius of Halicarnassus composed, a few years before Christ, his <title>Roman Archaeology</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία</foreign>), about half of which has survived. This was the history of Rome from the earliest period down to the First Punic War. It was written with taste and care. In the second half of the first century A.D. the Hebrew Iosephus wrote a work on Jewish archaeology and a history of the Jewish War. At the beginning of the second century, Plutarch of Chaeronea produced his fascinating biographies of famous Greeks and Romans. In the course of the same century appeared the <title>Anabasis</title> of Alexander the Great, written after the best authorities by Arrian of Nicomedia, the <title>Strategemata</title> of the Macedonian Polyaenus, a number of examples of military stratagems collected from older writers; and a part of the Roman history of the Alexandrian Appian, ethnographically arranged. At the beginning of the third century Dio Cassius of Nicaea conceived and executed his great work on Roman history, which has unfortunately come down to us in a very mutilated form. His younger contemporary, Herodianus, composed in eight books an interesting history of the Caesars, which still survives, from the death of Marcus Aurelius to Gordian (A.D. 180-238). Ancient chronology is much indebted to the <title>Chronicle</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Χρονικά</foreign>) of Eusebius , bishop of Caesarea. This was written in the fourth century A.D., and only survives in quotations and an Armenian translation. Among later writers we may mention Zosimus (in the second half of the sixth century), the author of a history of the Roman emperors, from Augustus to A.D. 410. For a bibliography of the great writers, see the separate articles in this dictionary. The fragments of their lost works will be found in the <title>Historicorum Graec. Fragmenta</title>, ed. by C. and Th. Müller for the Didot series, 5 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1868-74)</bibl>. The text of the minor historians is edited by L.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—The beginnings of Roman history date from about B.C. 200. The form of composition was, until the first half of the first century B.C., almost exclusively that of annals (<seg lang="la">annales</seg>), and the historians previous to that period are, in consequence, usually mentioned under the term “annalists.” They confined themselves exclusively to the history of their country in its widest extent, from the earliest times to their own. In later times, but not till then, Roman historians undertook to write on the events of special periods, generally on those of their own time. At first they wrote in Greek only. Among the greatest of these annalists are Fabius Pictor, L. Cincius Alimentus, C. Acilius, and Postumius Albinus. The first annalist to write in Latin was Cato the Censor (B.C. 184) in his <title>Origines</title>, now unfortunately lost. His example was followed by Cassius Hemina, L. Calpurnius Piso, Sempronius Tuditanus, and many others. The early annalistic writers of Latin had no style. It is not until the knowledge of Greek literature and the development of style had reached a higher stage in the second half of the second century B.C. that one finds any attempt at good writing. In the age of Cicero, good prose was at last attained, and many men of distinction, such as Varro, Atticus, Hortensius, and Cicero himself, wrote historical works and memoirs. Some even sought to include foreign history, as was the case with C. Cornelius Nepos in his well-known collection of biographies entitled <title>De Viris Illustribus.</title> The biographies which remain are mostly those of non-Roman generals. Iulius Caesar and Sallust surpass all the other historical writers of this period both in form and matter. Sallust is an imitator of Thucydides, and the first Roman historian who can lay any claim to finished execution. The other historians of the time whose works have come down to us are Aulus Hirtius, who continued Caesar's commentaries, and the unknown authors of the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish Wars.</p>
 <p>The Augustan Age produced the Roman history of Livy , a work as remarkable for its comprehensiveness as for its delightful literary finish. The greater part of it is unhappily lost. The first general history written in Latin, by Trogus Pompeius, belongs to the same period, but is preserved only in an epitome by Iustinus.</p>
 <p>The first century A.D. was fruitful in historical literature, but only a certain number of works have survived, including a short sketch of Roman history by Velleius Paterculus, which is unduly animated by the adulating spirit of the courtier; a collection of historical anecdotes by Valerius Maximus; a very rhetorical history of Alexander the Great, by Q. Curtius Rufus; and a number of instances of military stratagems by Iulius Frontinus. The great history of the Empire comprised in the <title>Annales</title> and <title>Historiae</title> of Tacitus, one of the most important monuments of Roman literature, was written partly in the first and partly in the second century A.D. Dating from the beginning of the second century A.D. we have the lives of the twelve Caesars, by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, and the panegyrical account of Roman history by Florus.</p>
 <p>After this period, Suetonius becomes the model of historians, and their favourite subject is the doings of the emperors and of the imperial court. These lost writings were the main sources of the <title>Historia Augusta</title>, a collection of biographies of the <cb /> emperors from Hadrian to Numerian (A.D. 117-284), abounding in personal details often scandalous and disgusting. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugustae-historiae-scriptores">Augustae Historiae</ref>.) For the history of the fourth century, the excellent work of Ammianus Marcellinus survives. At this time, writers began to content themselves with merely epitomizing and revising the books of their greater predecessors. Among the authors of historical summaries of this sort are Vopiscus, Eutropius, Orosius, St. Jerome, and Cassiodorus. There are valuable special histories by Iordanis (relating to the Goths), and by Gregory of Tours (relating to the Franks).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑποκριτής</foreign>). An actor. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The steps by which <foreign lang="greek">ὑποκρίνομαι, ὑποκριτής</foreign> acquired their dramatic meaning have been variously traced. The primitive sense of “answering” (i. e. of the quick repartee of dialogue between the actor and the chorus—<foreign lang="greek">ὑποκρίνεσθαι</foreign> implying a more ready and instantaneous reply than <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκρίνεσθαι</foreign>) seems quite sufficient for the purpose ( <bibl n="Poll.  4. 123" default="NO">Poll.iv. 123</bibl>).</p>
 <p>It is shown in the articles <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref> that the Greek drama originated in the chorus which at the festivals of Dionysus danced around his altar, and that at first one person detached himself from the chorus and, with mimetic gestures, related his story either to the chorus or in conversation with it. If the story thus acted required more than one person, they were all represented in succession by the same choreutes. Thespis , who was regarded in antiquity as the inventor of tragedy, was the first to employ an actor distinct from the chorus; the latter still took the most important part in the performance, but lost something of its original character by becoming an interlocutor in the dialogue. Aeschylus therefore added a second actor, so that the action and the dialogue became independent of the chorus, and the dramatist at the same time had an opportunity of showing two persons in contrast with each other on the stage (Aristot. <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 4. 16" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>4. 16</bibl>). Sophocles took the final step by adding a third actor (Aristot. l. c.); and towards the close of his career, Aeschylus found it necessary to follow the example of his younger rival, and to introduce a third actor, as is seen in the <title>Agamemnon, Choëphori</title>, and <title>Eumenides</title> ( <bibl n="Poll.  4. 110" default="NO">Poll.iv. 110</bibl>). This number of three actors was also adopted by Euripides, and remained the limit scarcely ever exceeded in any Greek drama, at least in tragedy. In comedy a somewhat greater license was taken; and though Cratinus kept to the regular three performers, Aristophanes sometimes, and notably in the <title>Thesmophoriazusae</title>, employed a larger number. 
<pb n="831" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Some real or apparent exceptions to this rule in tragedy have been keenly discussed, and demand a short notice. For instance, the <title>Prometheus</title> is a piece for two actors, yet in the opening scene there are four persons upon the stage—Prometheus, Hephaestus, and the allegorical <foreign lang="greek">Κράτος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Βία</foreign>. But <foreign lang="greek">Βία</foreign> does not speak, and mute actors were unquestionably not reckoned; while Prometheus himself, there can be no doubt, was represented by a gigantic lay figure, “so contrived that an actor standing behind the pictorial mountain could speak through the mask. No protagonist could have been expected to submit to the restraint of such an attitude throughout the whole of the play, to say nothing of the catastrophe at the end, when the rocks fall asunder, and Prometheus is dashed down into Tartarus” (Donaldson, <title>Theatre of the Greeks</title>, 7th ed. p. 286). In the <title>Choëphori</title> Aeschylus had three actors, but in 900 foll. a fourth seems required, where Pylades, who has been present most of the time as a mute actor, begins to speak. The notion of the Scholiast that the <foreign lang="greek">οἰκέτης</foreign>, who has only just quitted the stage, reappears as Pylades, is rejected by A. Müller on the ground that the actor has not had time to change his dress. It may be remarked, however, that the Greek tragic actor, in order to assume another character, had only to change an upper garment, a mask, and perhaps a wig. There were none of the minute toilet accessories of the modern “make-up,” and the operation may have been got through with much greater rapidity. Once more, in the <title>Oedipus at Colonus</title>, a fourth actor must be assumed unless the part of Theseus is divided among all three performers. The former alternative is supported by C. O. Müller (<title>Diss. on Eumen.</title> p. 127) and A. Müller (p. 175, n. 4); the latter by K. F. Hermann (<title>De Distributione Personarum inter Histriones in Tragoediis Graecis</title>, Marburg, 1840, p. 42) and Donaldson, who observes that “the mask and the uniformity of tragic declamation would make it as easy for two actors to represent one part as for one actor to sustain several characters” (p. 268 n.). The terms <foreign lang="greek">παρασκήνιον</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">παραχορήγημα</foreign> here come in for explanation. The usual meaning of <foreign lang="greek">παραχορήγημα</foreign> is of course a subordinate chorus or <foreign lang="greek">ἕτερος χορός</foreign>; but the statement that the word was also applied to the part taken by a fourth actor rests only on the authority of Pollux (iv. 109, 110), where there is almost certainly some confusion in the text. It is more likely that a supernumerary who spoke a few words only, such as the children in the <title>Medea</title>, or the above cases of a fourth actor being required, was called <foreign lang="greek">παρασκήνιον</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The three regular actors were distinguished by the technical names of <foreign lang="greek">πρωταγωνιστής, δευτεραγωνιστής</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τριταγωνιστής</foreign>, indicating the more or less prominent part each had to play in the drama. Certain conventional means were also devised, by which the spectators, as soon as an actor appeared on the stage, were enabled to judge which part he was going to perform; thus the protagonist regularly came from a door in the centre, the deuteragonist from one on the right, and the tritagonist from a door on the left-hand side ( <bibl n="Poll.  4. 124" default="NO">Poll.iv. 124</bibl>). The protagonist naturally undertook the character in which the interest of the piece was intended to centre; not always the title-rôle, unless it were that of the real hero or heroine. It is true that, in six out of the seven extant plays of Sophocles, the title-rôle is also the leading part; but in the <cb /> <title>Cresphontes</title> and <title>Oenomaüs</title> of Euripides the titlerôle was only a third-class part, and as such was taken by Aeschines ( <title>De Cor.</title> p. 288. 180). The conjecture is also unfounded that the protagonist was always the principal messenger (<foreign lang="greek">ἄγγελος</foreign>), or again that the narrative of a death (e. g. of Hippolytus or Pentheus) was necessarily assigned to the actor of the dead man's part (K. F. Hermann, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> p. 33). It is an ingenious but rather fanciful notion of K. O. Müller's (<title>Griech. Lit.</title> ii. 57) that the deuteragonist regularly took sympathetic parts as a friend of the hero or heroine, whereas the tritagonist was generally “an instigator who was the cause of the sufferings of the protagonist, while he himself was the least capable of depth of feeling or sympathy;” in popular language, that he was the “villain of the piece.” This is supported by the recorded fact that Creon in the <title>Antigone</title> was a tritagonist's part, and by an arrangement of the characters in the Orestean trilogy of Aeschylus which gives the part of Clytaemnestra throughout to the tritagonist. It is a fact not without significance that the thirty-two extant tragedies contain no “hero” who is also a “villain,” like <title>Macbeth</title> or <title>Richard the Third;</title> but the titles of lost plays show an <title>Ixion</title> of Aeschylus, an <title>Acrisius</title> and an <title>Atreus</title> of Sophocles; and it would seem that the villainhero, though rare, was not altogether unknown. It is safer to say with Donaldson that the second and third performers “seem to have divided the other characters between them, less according to any fixed rule than in obedience to the directions of the poet, who was guided by the exigencies of his play.” As on the modern stage, parts were written for particular actors; a proof that the author, notwithstanding the many conventional restrictions imposed by the sacred character of the Attic drama, had some influence over the choice of his actors.</p>
 <p>The number of supernumeraries was unlimited. They were usually silent, but sometimes spoke a few words, especially when a fourth interlocutor was required as above; in which case the speaker was occasionally placed behind the scenes, or sheltered from view by the chorus, that the limit of three actors might not be obtrusively violated. Persons of rank and dignity always came upon the stage suitably attended, just as no Athenian lady or gentleman in real life went out without at least one slave: the body-guards of royal personages were a conspicuous feature, so that <foreign lang="greek">δορυφόρος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δορυφόρημα</foreign> became an equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">κωφὸν πρόσωπον</foreign>, and in one or two instances (the opening scene of the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> and probably that of the <title>Acharnians</title>) we have a regular “stage-mob” of citizens like those in <title>Julius Caesar</title> and <title>Wilhelm Tell.</title></p>
 <p>The acting of female characters by men was greatly assisted by the use of masks; there was no need to assign such parts to beardless youths, as in England in the Shakespearian times. In early days the dramatic poets themselves acted in their own plays, and doubtless as protagonists. Of Aeschylus it is further recorded that he was his own ballet-master, and trained his choruses to dance without the aid of a professional <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχηστοδιδάσκαλος</foreign> ( <bibl n="Ath.  1. 21" default="NO">Ath.i. 21</bibl> e). Sophocles appeared only twice on the stage; as Thamyris in the play of that name, accompanying a song on the <seg lang="la">cithara</seg>, and as Nausicaa playing at ball, in the <foreign lang="greek">Πλύντριαι</foreign>: he then gave up acting on account of the weak 
<pb n="832" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00832">
<head orig="Green-room of an Ancient Theatre.">Green-room of an Ancient Theatre.</head>
</figure>
 ness of his voice. After his time it became exceptional for the poet to be also an actor. Aeschylus, who seems to have been usually protagonist in his own plays, employed Cleander as his deuteragonist, and subsequently (after the introduction of a third actor) Mynniscus as tritagonist (<title>Vit. Aesch.</title> p. 3, l. 75 Dind.). Cleidemides and Tlepolemus were similarly associated with Sophocles, and Cephisophon with Euripides. Actors sometimes received enormous salaries, occasionally as much as a talent ($1180) for two or even one day's performance ( <bibl n="Gel.  11. 9. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xi. 9. 2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>No social stigma attached to the actor's calling (Corn. Nep. <bibl n="App. Praef. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Praef.</title>5</bibl>). Distinguished Athenian citizens appeared on the stage as amateurs, and the rôle of a <foreign lang="greek">τριταγωνιστής</foreign>, notwithstanding the scurrilous and exaggerated invectives of Demosthenes, did not detract from Aeschines' position as a soldier and orator. Bad actors, however, to whatever station in life they belonged, were not, on that account, spared; displeasure was shown by whistling or hissing (<foreign lang="greek">συρίττειν</foreign>, Demosth. <title>De Cor.</title> p. 315. 265); another word is <foreign lang="greek">θορυβεῖν</foreign>, probably denoting uproar against the author rather than the actor. For the throwing of fruit or nuts in theatres, and sometimes even of stones, cf. [Andoc. ] <title>c. Alcib.</title> 20; Demosth. <title>De Cor.</title> p. 314. 262. On the other hand, the practice of encoring (<foreign lang="greek">αὖθις</foreign>) is inferred from  <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 9. 4." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>9. 4.</bibl></p>
 <p>At a later time, when Greece had lost her independence, we find regular troops of actors, who were either stationary in particular towns of Greece, or wandered from place to place, and engaged themselves wherever they found it most profitable. They formed regular companies or guilds (<foreign lang="greek">σύνοδοι</foreign>) with their own internal organization, with their common officers, property, and sacra. There are a number of inscriptions belonging to such companies. They can be traced at Athens, Thebes, Argos, Teos, Cyprus, and Rhegium. But these actors are generally spoken of in very contemptuous terms; they were perhaps in some cases slaves or freedmen, and their pay was sometimes as low as seven drachmas ($1.25) for a performance (Lucian, <title>Icaromen.</title> 29). The language of Lucian must, however, be received with caution. He has evidently confused the old Greek estimate of the profession with the much lower Roman one of his own time; and in one passage ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>5</bibl>) writes as though Polus and Aristodemus, free Greeks of the highest consideration, had been liable to the <seg lang="la">ius virgarum in histriones.</seg> <cb /></p>

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The word <seg lang="la">histriones</seg>, by which the Roman actors were called, is said to have been formed from the Etruscan <hi rend="italic">hister</hi>, which signified a <seg lang="la">ludio</seg> or dancer (<bibl n="Liv.  7. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vii. 2</bibl>). The origin of scenic representations at Rome has been related under <ref type="cross" target="crosscomoedia">Comoedia</ref>. The name <seg lang="la">histrio</seg> thenceforward lost the signification of a dancer, and was now applied to the actors in the drama. Only the Atellanae (q. v.) and <seg lang="la">exodia</seg> were played by freeborn Romans, while the regular drama was left to the histriones, who formed a distinct class of persons.</p>
 <p>In the times of Plautus and Terence we find the actors gathered into a company (<seg lang="la">grex, caterva</seg>), under the control of a manager (<seg lang="la">dominus gregis</seg>, also called <seg lang="la">actor</seg> in a technical sense, though <seg lang="la">actor</seg> is of course also a synonym of <seg lang="la">histrio</seg>). It was through the manager that a magistrate who was giving games, of which stage-plays formed a part, engaged the services of a company. Brutus, who was praetor in the year of Caesar's death, tried to regain the popularity he had lost through the murder by giving the Ludi Apollinares with unusual splendour; and he went all the way to Naples to negotiate with actors, who seem to have been Greeks, besides getting his friends to use their interest in his behalf ( <bibl n="Plut. Brut. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Brut.</title>21</bibl>). So in imperial times a public singer is said <seg lang="la">vocem vendere praetoribus</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 379" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 379</bibl>). The pay (<seg lang="la">merces</seg>) was on as varied a scale as in modern times. In the first century of the Empire an ordinary actor seems to have received five denarii and his food ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 80. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>80. 7</bibl>); while at an earlier period “stars” like Roscius and Aesopus, the contemporaries and friends of Cicero, made ample fortunes. Cicero tells us that Roscius could have honourably made 6,000,000 sesterces ($240,000) in ten years had he chosen to do so (<title>Pro Rosc. Com.</title> 8. 23); and Pliny gives half a million ($20,000) as his annual earnings. The tradition preserved by Macrobius ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 3. 14. 11" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>iii. 14. 11</bibl>-13) is that Roscius alone received 1000 denarii ($175) for every day's performance; while Aesopus left a fortune of 20,000,000 sesterces ($800,000), acquired solely by his profession. This was afterwards squandered by his son ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 239" default="NO"> Sat., 239</bibl>).</p>
 <p>It is clear from the words of Livy (vii. 2) that the histriones were not citizens; that they were not contained in the tribes, nor allowed to be enlisted as soldiers in the Roman legions; and that, if any citizen entered the profession of histrio, he, on this account, was excluded from his tribe. The histriones were therefore usually either freedmen, foreigners, or slaves; the latter specially educated for the stage to their master's profit. Even if <seg lang="la">ingenui</seg>, they were legally <seg lang="la">infames</seg> (Edict. Praet. <title>ap. Dig.</title> 3, 2, 1; cf. <title>De Rep.</title> iv. <hi rend="italic">fr.</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Aug. <title>De Civ. Dei</title>, ii. 13), and socially in low estimation ( <title>Pro Arch.</title> 5. 10; Corn. Nep. <bibl n="App. Praef. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Praef.</title>4</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>35</bibl>). Aesopus seems to have been a freedman of the Claudian gens; but Roscius, the <seg lang="la">amor et deliciae</seg> of Cicero, was certainly <seg lang="la">ingenuus</seg>, and probably of good birth. Sulla gave him the gold ring of equestrian rank. 
<pb n="833" /><cb /> Towards the close of the Republican period, a few men of position and Greek culture raised themselves above the prejudices of their countrymen, and valued the person no less than the genius of great artists. When Caesar forced <ref type="cross" target="crosslaberius">Laberius</ref> (q.v.), a knight advanced in years, to appear on the stage in his own mimes, he was thought to have exceeded the powers even of a dictator, and his victim took a dignified revenge (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 7. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 7. 3</bibl> foll.). Under the emperors men of equestrian rank often appeared, with or without compulsion ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>43</bibl>; Dio Cass. liii. 31;  <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>35</bibl>); and this circumstance, together <figure id="fig.00833">
<head orig="Comic Actor. (From an Engraved Ring.)">Comic Actor. (From an Engraved Ring.)</head>
</figure> with the increasing influence of Greek manners, tended to improve the social position of the actors. At the very beginning of the reign of Tiberius it had become necessary to check the extravagant compliments paid them ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 77</bibl>). Their legal status remained the same as regards <seg lang="la">infamia</seg> and exclusion from office; even provincial honours are denied them in the Lex Iulia Municipalis of B.C. 45, where they are coupled with gladiators (<title>C. I. L.</title> p. 123); thoughinscriptions show that the rule was not always enforced (Orelli, 2625). But the old law was now somewhat modified, by which the Roman magistrates were empowered to coerce the histriones at any time and in any place, and the praetor had the right to scourge them (<seg lang="la">ius virgarum in histriones</seg>). Augustus entirely did away with the <seg lang="la">ius virgarum</seg>, and limited the interference of the magistrates to the time when, and the place where (<seg lang="la">ludi et scaena</seg>), the actors performed ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>). But he nevertheless inflicted, of his own authority, very severe punishments upon those actors who, either in their private life or in their conduct on the stage, committed any impropriety. After these regulations the only legal punishments that could be inflicted upon actors for improper conduct seem to have been imprisonment and exile ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 14</bibl><bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. Ann., xiii. 28</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The competition of the actors for public favour was carried to extraordinary lengths, and stirred up factions like those of the Circus. If not as early as the time of Plautus himself, yet at the time when the existing Plautine prologues were composed (probably about B.C. 150-100), we find partisanship (<seg lang="la">ambitio</seg>) in full operation (Plaut.  <title>Poen.</title>prol. 37 foll.). At first palms and inexpensive crowns of gold or silver tinsel were the reward of popularity (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxi. 6</bibl>); afterwards, under the Empire, presents of money and rich garments ( <bibl n="Juv.  7. 243" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vii. 243</bibl> with Schol.). There was a regularly organized and paid <hi rend="italic">claque</hi> (the <seg lang="la">theatrales operae</seg> of  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 16</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Mart.  4. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 5</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 8</bibl>); and over and above that the backers (<seg lang="la">fautores</seg>) resorted to actual violence and even bloodshed. Hence Tiberius on one occasion found himself obliged to expel all histriones from Italy ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 14</bibl>); but they were recalled and patronized by his successor. The emperors as a rule tolerated, sometimes encouraged, and occasionally checked the excesses of the stage. We read of the emperor's private companies who performed during dinner-time ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>74</bibl>), and were sometimes allowed also to play in the theatres before the people. The <cb /> practice of giving immoderate sums to actors was restricted by Tiberius ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 77</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>34</bibl>); again by M. Aurelius, and by Alexander Severus. Aurelius ordained a maximum payment of five aurei ($25.50) to each actor, and that no <seg lang="la">editor</seg> should exceed the sum of ten aurei ($51); this must mean that there were to be <seg lang="la">editores</seg> in number equal to half the actors, for it cannot be thought that he reduced the actors to two for each performance. The restrictions of the Greek stage as to the number of actors never prevailed upon the Roman.

<head orig="Homērus">Homerus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὅμηρος</foreign>). The ancient Greeks never doubted the historical existence of Homer. He was to them “the poet” (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ποιητής</foreign>) in a special sense, but they knew nothing of him as a person. Eight Greek biographies of him are still extant— one under the name of Plutarch, another falsely ascribed to Herodotus—but none of them have any historic value; most of them belong to the Christian era. The early Greeks had no more interest in literary biography than the English contemporaries of Chaucer, and later generations supplied the lack of knowledge from vague tradition and from uncertain indications in the works attributed to the poet. They did not require scientific accuracy of statement, and enjoyed a good story too well to question its truth. A large variety of manifestly fictitious genealogical trees is presented for Homer, in many of which he is brought into some connection with Hesiod. Some made him a descendant of Orpheus. He was called by some Melesigenes, as the son of the river-god Meles, near Smyrna. Others called him Maeonides, either as the son of Maeon or the son of Maeonia (Lydia). A well-known epigram emphasizes the uncertainty with regard to his birthplace. More than seven cities claimed him as their own. Some thought he was born at Smyrna, and near that city a grotto was shown in which they said he composed his poems. Simonides (<title>Frag.</title> 85) called him a Chian, doubtless partly on the strength of the verse in the Hymn to Delian Apollo, 172, <foreign lang="greek">τυφλὸς ἀνήρ, οἰκεῖ δὲ Χίῳ ἔνι παιπαλοέσσῃ</foreign>, which is quoted by Thucydides (iii. 104)—a verse which at least supported the popular belief in the poet's blindness. The great critic Aristarchus thought him an Athenian, basing his arguments upon characteristics of the Homeric dialect. Aristodemus of Nyssa believed him to be a Roman, because of the similarity of certain Roman customs with those described by the poet. Others would make an Ithacan of him. Others thought him an Aegyptian. Lucian called him a Babylonian, but doubtless in merry jest. It was reserved for an English scholar, however, to suggest that if Homer's name were read backwards, in Hebrew style, <foreign lang="greek">ΟΜΗΡΟΣ</foreign> would become <foreign lang="greek">ΣΟΡΗΜΟ</foreign>, which was only another form for Solomon; thus the Homeric poems were ascribed to the Hebrew king. He was generally assumed to have lived about a century or a century and a half 
<pb n="834" /><cb /> after the Trojan War <bibl default="NO">(B.C. 1183)</bibl>. Others made him flourish about B.C. 976. He was set by Herodotus (ii. 53) not more than four hundred years before his time, or B.C. 850. The church fathers, Clemens Alexandrinus and Tatian, inclined to set the date of his birth as late as possible, in order to sustain their claim that the wisdom of the Greeks was derived from the Hebrews.</p>
 <p>Scholars no longer ask where Homer was born or when he lived, but in what regions and tribes of Greece epic poetry was perfected, and in what centuries the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> received their present form. Not that all would deny that any poet Homer ever lived to whom we owe the <title>Iliad</title> or <title>Odyssey</title>, or both, but all authentic information regarding him has perished beyond recovery. Even in his poems his personality is kept entirely in the background.</p>
 <p>The meaning of the name Homer is uncertain. Many stories were invented to account for it as meaning “a hostage.” Half a century ago it was explained as “the uniter” (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμοῦ ἀραρίσκω</foreign>), and thus it was made to sustain the view that the poems are only a conglomeration of distinct and independent lays. Georg Curtius showed that, according to analogy, the name should mean “the united,” not “the uniter.” The plural <foreign lang="greek">Ὅμηροι</foreign> would then be used of the members of a guild of poet-singers. The next generation would be <foreign lang="greek">Ὁμηρίδαι</foreign>, and from this patronymic an assumption was made of an original <foreign lang="greek">Ὅμηρος</foreign>. This pro<figure id="fig.00834">
<head orig="Ideal Head of Homer. (Sans Souci Palace, Potsdam.)">Ideal Head of Homer. (Sans Souci Palace, Potsdam.)</head>
</figure> cess has been playfully but fairly illustrated by the succession in English: “fellows” (<foreign lang="greek">ὅμηροι</foreign>), “the fellows' guild” (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμηρίδαι</foreign>), “the Fellows guild” (<foreign lang="greek">Ὁμηρίδαι</foreign>), which last assumes a Mr. Fellows (<foreign lang="greek">Ὅμηρος</foreign>) as its founder. But very possibly the name had nothing to do with the profession of song.</p>
 <p>Homer was to the early Greeks the personification of epic poetry. All the old epic poems were attributed to him, as all great achievements were assigned to Heracles—not only what are extant, <cb /> but also what are known as the cyclic poems: the <title>Cypria</title> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Κύπρια</foreign>, in eleven books, of the judgment of Paris, the rape of Helen, and other events which immediately preceded the Trojan War—ascribed by others to Stasinus of Cyprus), the <title>Aethiopis</title> and <title>Iliupersis</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰθιοπίς</foreign>, in five books, of the arrival of the Amazons and the Aethiopian Memnon, the defence of Troy, and the death of Achilles; and <foreign lang="greek">Ἰλίου Πέρσις</foreign>, in two books, of the device of the wooden horse and the capture of the city —generally ascribed to Arctinus of Miletus), the <title>Little Iliad</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰλιὰς Μικρά</foreign>, in four books, in which Philoctetes and Achilles' son Neoptolemus were brought to the help of the Greeks—by Lesches of Mitylené), the <title>Nosti</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Νόστοι</foreign>, in five books, of the adventures of the Greeks on their return from Troy—by Agias of Troezen), and the <title>Telegonia</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Τηλεγονία</foreign>, in two books, a sort of conclusion of the story of the <title>Odyssey</title>—by Eugammon of Cyrené).</p>
 <p>When Aeschylus said that his tragedies were but crumbs from the rich feast of Homer (Athen. viii. 347 E, <foreign lang="greek">τὰς αὑτοῦ τραγῳδίας τεμάχη εἶναι ἔλεγε τῶν Ὁμήρου μεγάλων δείπνων</foreign>), he probably had in mind not only the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title>, but also the other poems of the Trojan cycle, from which he borrowed suggestions, as is seen from the titles of his plays. Herodotus was the first, so far as is known, to deny the Homeric authorship of the <title>Cypria.</title> This he did (ii. 117) on the ground of the inconsistency that the poet of the <title>Cypria</title> made Paris reach Troy on the third day from Sparta, while the poet of the <title>Iliad</title> represented him as driven on a devious course to Sidon; and the historian remarks that nowhere else does Homer contradict himself (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδαμῇ ἄλλῃ ἀνεπόδισε ἑωυτόν</foreign>). Thucydides (iii. 104) seems to have acknowledged or assumed the Homeric authorship of the so-called Homeric Hymns. Plato and Xenophon mean our <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> when they speak of Homer; but Aristotle (<title>Nicom. Eth.</title> 1141 a) quotes from the <title>Margites</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ὥσπερ Ὅμηρός φησιν ἐν τῷ Μαργίτῃ</foreign>). The earliest Alexandrian editor of Homer, Zenodotus, seems to have assigned to him only the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title></p>
 <p>Among the minor poems of Homer are generally placed the <title>Hymns, Battle of the Frogs and Mice</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Βατραχομυομαχία</foreign>), <title>Jests</title> (<foreign lang="greek">παίγνια</foreign>), and <title>Margites.</title> The <title>Hymns</title> are not hymns in the modern sense of the term; they are rather epic than lyric. They number thirty-four in all, but ten are brief, having only three to six lines each. The first two, to Apollo, were counted as one until the critic Rhunken in 1749 convinced scholars that the first was in praise of Delian (178 verses) and the second of Pythian Apollo (368 verses). The latest editor endeavours again to show that the two are simply parts of one. The third Hymn (580 verses) tells of the birth of Hermes and the exploits and tricks of the new-born babe: how he found a tortoise and invented the seven-stringed lyre (<foreign lang="greek">φόρμιγξ</foreign>), how he stole the cattle of Apollo and then returned to his cradle, finally appeasing Apollo's wrath by the gift of the lyre. This and the one immediately following are distinctly secular, not religious, in their character. The fourth Hymn (293 verses) tells of Aphrodité and her love for Anchises. The fifth Hymn (495 verses), to Demeter, has a more serious tone than the preceding. It seems to have been intended to state the mythical foundation for the Eleusinian Mysteries. It tells how Persephoné, Demeter's daughter, was carried off by 
<pb n="835" /><cb /> Hades as she was plucking flowers (“herself a fairer flower”), and of the disconsolate wanderings of the mother in search of her daughter until she found a temporary home at Eleusis; on her departure thence a temple was built in her honour, and at last the mother and daughter were united. No one of the other Hymns has more than sixty verses. They are “introductions,” proems (<foreign lang="greek">προοίμια</foreign>), intended to be sung before the rhapsodist's recital of some other lay (perhaps at some rhapsodic contest), as a sort of “grace before meat”—in the same spirit which made every Greek festivity sacred to some divinity. No external evidence exists for the date of these Hymns. They contain many Homeric formulas and tags of verses which give an antique flavour even to what is comparatively modern. Parts of the poems may go back to a remote antiquity; the Hymn to Demeter may have been composed about B.C. 650; more date from the fifth and sixth centuries. After the fifth century, the interest in epic recitations was so slight that these proems would not be composed.</p>
 <p>The <title>Batrachomyomachia</title> is a comic epic poem of 303 verses, giving a burlesque account of the battle between the frogs and mice, when Puff-cheek (<foreign lang="greek">Φυσίγναθος</foreign>), king of the frogs, caused the death of Crumb-snatcher (<foreign lang="greek">Ψιχάρπαξ</foreign>), a promising young mouse, inviting him and bearing him on his back to visit his home, but deserting him in the midst of the waters on the approach of a water-snake. The story is composed with humour and some ingenuity, but is a light production. It was ascribed to Pigres, son of Lygdamis and nephew of the Artemisia who distinguished herself in the battle of Salamis; but if it were composed by him, it was interpolated and worked over later. Very possibly it was composed in the Alexandrian period, in mockery of the revival of epic poetry after the ancient spirit was lost. The epigrams and jests are entirely insignificant, both in quantity and quality. The only one of any note is the answer of Arcadian fishers to the question as to their luck: “All that they took, they left; what they did not take, they brought with them” (<foreign lang="greek">ὅσσ ἕλομεν, λιπόμεσθ λτ;γτ; ὅσα δ οὐχ ἕλομεν φερόμεσθα</foreign>). The <title>Margites</title> was a comic poem of considerable fame in antiquity, part in dactylic hexameter and part in iambic trimeter verse, with the story of a stupid (<foreign lang="greek">μάργος</foreign>), bashful fellow, who had all manner of ridiculous adventures and attempted many things which were beyond his powers. As long as critics are not agreed as to what works are rightly attributed to Chaucer, and even as to the authorship of some of the plays which have been ascribed to Shakespeare, no one can wonder that little is known of the history of the incunabula of Greek poetry, composed in the imaginative age, long before the classical period.</p>
 <p>The <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title> contain the story of parts of the Trojan cycle of myths.</p>
 <p>The <title>Iliad</title> opens with a scene in the last of the ten years of the Siege of Troy, and the action of the poem continues for only seven weeks. With great ingenuity (as it would seem) just enough incidental indications are given of the early history of the war to supply the needed basis for an intelligent appreciation of the story. As Horace says, Homer <seg lang="la">semper ad eventum festinat et in medias res, non secus ac notas auditorem rapit.</seg> The judgment of Paris and the assignment of the prize of beauty to the Goddess of Love are referred to in the <cb /> Homeric poems but once, and that in a doubtful passage, xxiv. 29, 30. Paris (his Greek name Alexander is more frequent in the poems), the voluptuous son of Priam, king of Ilios (the later Ilium), in the Trojan land, on the south western shore of the Hellespont, had sailed to Lacedaemon and carried away Helen, the beautiful wife of Menelaüs, the king, and many of her possessions. In order to avenge this insult and to recover the woman and her treasures, Menelaüs and his brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, gathered an army at Aulis, and with 1186 ships (and perhaps 100,000 men) set sail for the plain of Troy. For ten years they besiege the city. They bring with them no supplies, and spend much of their time in making forays on the neighbouring districts and more formal expeditions against the adjoining towns. The captured men are slain or sold to distant islands; the women are kept as slaves. The Trojans are not closely barred within their walls, but they are unable to cultivate their fields and are obliged to send their treasures to their neighbours, in order to buy provisions and to hire mercenaries. The loss of men does not seem to have been very great on either side in the early years of the war. At the opening of the <title>Iliad</title>, an old priest of Apollo, Chryses, comes to the Greek camp to ransom his daughter, who had been captured by the Greeks and given as a prize of honour to Agamemnon. The king refuses the request, and Apollo avenges the slight to his priest by sending a pestilence upon the Greek camp. After nine days an assembly of the army is called, and the seer Calchas declares the cause of the god's anger. The rude language used by Achilles, the mightiest of the Greek warriors, arouses the wrath of Agamemnon, and a quarrel follows. Achilles “sulks in his tent,” while his mother, the goddess Thetis, persuades Zeus to grant victory to the Trojan arms. The action of the <title>Iliad</title> includes only four days of battle. In the first, ii.-vii. 380, neither side gains any great advantage; in the second, viii., the tide of battle often turns and the gods interfere again and again, but at last the Trojans drive the foe to their camp, and bivouac on the plain, near the Greek watchfires. In the third day of battle, xi.-xviii., the Trojans break into the Greek camp and begin to set fire to the fleet; but as soon as Achilles sees the flickering flame he sends his comrade Patroclus with his Myrmidons, enjoining upon him to drive the Trojans from the camp, but not to attempt to capture the city. Patroclus forgets the warning of his chief, and filled with the spirit of the combat presses on too far; Apollo strikes him (the only instance in the poems of such direct interference of a divinity), and Hector slays him. Achilles now becomes more angry at Hector than he had been at Agamemnon, and takes an active part in the fourth day of battle, xix.—xxii., in which he drives the Trojans in confusion into their city, and slays Hector. The twenty-third book is devoted to the funeral games in honour of Patroclus, in accordance with the curious ancient custom of honouring the dead with horse-races and foot-races and contests in wrestling, boxing, putting the shot, and shooting the bow. In the twenty-fourth book old Priam comes to the Greek camp and ransoms the body of Hector from Achilles, who here appears in a gentler mood. The poem closes very simply: “Thus these were busy with the burial of Hector.”</p>
 <p>After the action of the <title>Iliad</title>, the Aethiopian Memnon 
<pb n="836" /><cb /> comes with his men to the help of Troy, while Philoctetes with the bow of Heracles and Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, after his father's death, come to aid the Greeks. The alliance of the Amazons with the Trojans is not mentioned in the poems. Odysseus plans the Wooden Horse, by which the city is captured. Athené's wrath is kindled against the Greeks by their conduct after the capture of the city, and she sends upon them a storm, which scatters their fleets. Menelaüs is driven to Crete and Egypt, and with Helen reaches his home in Sparta only in the eighth year of their wandering. Odysseus is driven first to the land of the lotus-eaters, then to the island of the Cyclopes, where Polyphemus slays and devours six of his comrades (and is blinded by him), thence to the land of the Laestrygonians (where all but one of his ships are destroyed), and to Circe's island, where he passes a year. He then visits Hades, in order to consult the soul of the blind Theban seer, Teiresias. In Hades he sees the shade of his mother and those of many of the Greek heroes. On his return the dangers of Scylla and Charybdis are met. His comrades slay one of the cattle of the Sun, and their boat is wrecked. Odysseus himself is borne to the island of the sea-nymph Calypso, who cares for him tenderly, and would make him immortal and her husband. The scene of the <title>Odyssey</title> opens in the tenth year after the close of the Trojan War and the twentieth after the departure of Odysseus from his home on Ithaca. He has been absent so long that no expectation is entertained of his return. His home is filled by more than a hundred young princes, each eager to win the hand of the faithful and prudent wife, Penelopé; and thus to become the king of the realm. The goddess Athené pities Odysseus, who is weary of his sojourn in the grotto of Calypso and longing for his home, and secures the decree of Zeus for his return. Meanwhile she sends his son Telemachus to Nestor and Menelaüs, asking for tidings of his father. Odysseus sets out from Calypso's island, eighteen days' sail to the west, but as he approaches Greece he is wrecked by the sea-god Poseidon, whose son Polyphemus he had blinded, and is cast on the shore of the Phaeacians (identified by the ancients with Corcyra, the modern Corfu), who convey him to his home. Finding his palace in the possession of haughty suitors, he returns in the guise of a beggar, but with the help of his son and two faithful servants (and Athené) he slays the suitors and regains his kingdom and faithful wife.</p>
 <p>The action of the <title>Odyssey</title> covers only six weeks —less even than that of the <title>Iliad</title>—yet the events of the ten years of wandering are comprised in the stories which are put into the mouth of Nestor , Menelaüs, and Odysseus himself. This device of introducing a full account of events which are not included in the time of the proper action of the poem was followed by Vergil in his account of the capture of Troy (as told by Aeneas), and by Milton in his account of the war in heaven (told by Raphael). Many matters which are merely touched upon in the poem were discussed more fully in the lesser epic poems, and the question has been raised whether these brief mentions in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> were allusions to the fuller accounts, already familiar to the hearer, or rather were the fruitful germs which were later developed into the <title>Cypria</title>, the <title>Nosti</title>, etc. In some <cb /> cases the latter alternative seems certain—e. g. on the death of Hector, his wife Andromaché despairs of safety for herself and her son Astyanax; “he will either accompany her into slavery, or some Greek will seize him by the arm and hurl him from the wall.” This seems to have suggested to a later poet the detailed description of such a death for the boy.</p>
 <p>The influence of the Homeric poems upon the Greeks was very great. Pindar says that Odysseus had more fame than he deserved because of the sweet-voiced Homer ( <bibl n="pind. n. 7. 20" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>vii. 20</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ἐγὼ δὲ πλέον ἔλπομαι λόγον Ὀδυσσέος ἢ πάθαν διὰ τὸν ἁδυεπῆ γενέσθ Ὅμηρον</foreign>). Herodotus (ii. 53) even asserts that Homer and Hesiod fixed the theogony of the Greeks, distributing to the gods their epithets, arts, and honours. Appeal was made to the Homeric poems to settle questions of precedence and of title to territory. These poems were in large measure the basis of the Greek youth's education. A fragment of a play of Aristophanes (<title>Frag.</title> 222) shows us a father examining his son, to prove his diligence in school, on the meaning of certain obsolete Homeric words: <foreign lang="greek">τί καλοῦσι κόρυμβα; τί καλοῦσ ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα</foreign>; In the <title>Symposium</title> of Xenophon (iii. 5), Niceratus says that his father, the noted Athenian general Nicias, in his desire to make a good man of him, compelled him to learn all the poems of Homer, and that he could repeat the entire <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> from memory. At the Panathenaic festival from the time of Solon early in the sixth century, for at least two hundred years the recitation of portions of the Homeric poems had a prominent place ( <title>Leocrates</title>, 102). The Platonic dialogue  <title>Ion</title>reports a conversation between Socrates and the Ephesian rhapsode Ion, who visits Athens after taking the prize in the Homeric recitation at Epidaurus, and expects the same honour from the Panathenaic festival. This Ion was a Homeric specialist; he claimed no unusual familiarity with Hesiod and Archilochus, but asserted that no one equalled him as an interpreter of Homer. Such men naturally magnified their office and represented the poet as the teacher of much occult wisdom—finding in his works the best maxims for war and for peace, for the statesman, the philosopher, and the general. Even Aristophanes represents Aeschylus as saying, “From what has divine Homer received his fame except from his most excellent instructions with regard to tactics, brave deeds, and the arming of men?” (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1034" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Frogs</title>, 1034</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ δὲ θεῖος Ὅμηρος</foreign> | <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τοῦ τιμὴν καὶ κλέος ἔσχεν πλὴν τοῦδ ὅτι χρήστ ἐδίδαξεν</foreign> | <foreign lang="greek">τάξεις ἀρετὰς ὁπλίσεις ἀνδρῶν</foreign>). The words of Horace are familiar: at Praeneste he read again Homer, who taught what was base and what was honourable more fully and better than the Stoic Chrysippus or the Academic philosopher Crantor (<title>Epist.</title> i. 2. 1, <title>Troiani belli scriptorem . . . relegi; | qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non, | plenius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit</title>). Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 10. 599" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>x. 599</bibl> c) refutes the view that Homer had special wisdom in regard to “wars, generalships, administration of cities, and the education of men,” thus showing the prevalence of that belief.</p>
 <p>According to an uncertain story, Pythagoras was said to have seen Homer in Hades, suffering torments in return for his statements about the gods. But the first definite criticism of Homer, so far as is known, was that of Xenophanes (<title>Frag.</title> 7), at the close of the sixth century B.C., that Homer 
<pb n="837" /><cb /> and Hesiod attributed to the gods all actions which are regarded as shameful by men. Heraclitus, Xenophanes' contemporary, would have Homer driven from the musical contests. Plato, in his <title>Republic</title> (ii. 377 d-iii. 391 c), enters into a detailed examination of the moral effect exerted by the Homeric poems, and declares that the youths who are in process of training to be the guardians of his ideal State must not be rendered impious by hearing what would degrade the gods in their eyes; lest they should fear death more than defeat and flight, they must not hear Zeus lamenting the death of Sarpedon ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16. 433" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xvi. 433</bibl> foll.), and Achilles declaring that he would rather serve a poor man on earth than rule over all the dead in the home of Hades ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 11. 488" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xi. 488</bibl> foll.); they must not be taught insubordination and insolence to commanding officers by hearing Achilles call Agamemnon a coward ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 225" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 225</bibl>); and they must not learn to give free rein to their passions from the wantonness of Zeus ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14. 314" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xiv. 314</bibl> foll.) and from Odysseus' enjoyment of food and drink ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 9. 5" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>ix. 5</bibl> foll.). Thus, although with much regret because of his old regard and affection for the poet, the works of Homer are not allowed in Plato's ideal State. The reader is at a loss to know how seriously he is to understand these words of the philosopher, who is fond of clinching an argument or giving a higher literary flavour to a sentence by a quotation from the “inspired poet.” Allegory was already employed in the interpretation of the most offensive passages, but Plato says that the young person cannot distinguish between what is allegorical and what is not ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 378D" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>ii. 378 d</bibl>). In the <title>Phaedrus</title> (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 243A" default="NO" valid="yes">243 a</bibl>) he playfully suggests that the poet may have lost his sight because of his false statements with regard to the gods. Plutarch, in his treatise on “How a young man should study poetry,” makes a formal reply to Plato without naming him, urging that the young should be taught to discriminate between what is admirable in itself and what is an admirable imitation of the offensive or even base. The rhetorician Zoïlus received the nickname of Homer's Scourge (<foreign lang="greek">Ὁμηρομάστιξ</foreign>) because of his severe criticisms on the poet; but these were meant very likely merely as a paradox, just as other rhetoricians showed their ingenuity in maintaining the guilt of Socrates, the innocence of Busiris, and the advantages of fever and vermin.</p>
 <p>The old Greek commentaries (<hi rend="italic">scholia</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">σχόλια</foreign>) on Homer mention editions by Antimachus of Colophon (himself an epic poet, a contemporary of Plato), and by Aristotle, who was said to have prepared an edition expressly for the use of his distinguished pupil, Alexander the Great ( <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Alex.</title>8</bibl>). Athenian school-masters prepared also lists of obsolete Homeric words. The critical study of Homer, however, began at Alexandria, in connection with the great library and “Museum” which were established by the Ptolemies. These kings of Egypt had abundant means with which to encourage the arts and sciences, and desired by the help of Greek civilization to break down the barriers which existed between the different races of their subjects and to exalt their kingdom. They gathered men of literary talent from all lands and set apart a portion of the palace for a great library. Strenuous efforts were made to secure copies of all works of Greek literature, and, in fact, of all literature, including, according to the story, the Greek translation of the Hebrew <cb /> Scriptures. In the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus (who reigned B.C. 285-247), the library was said to contain 400,000 volumes (rolls)—perhaps equal to about 40,000 modern octavo volumes—such a collection as had never existed before. It possessed copies of Homer from Marseilles, Chios (the seat of the Homeridae), Sinope on the Black Sea, Argos, Cyprus, Crete. The Homeric poems formed the centre of the literary studies of the Alexandrian scholars. The first careful editor and reviser of the Homeric text was Zenodotus, the earliest of the librarians. He had before him copies of the poems with variations which extended over whole verses and clauses, as well as to words and forms. A critical procedure was necessary. Even the same manuscript must have shown marked inconsistencies of grammatical forms. The first critical edition, in the nature of the case, must have been an experiment. The editor can have had no fixed principles with regard to the formation of words and the characteristics of the Homeric dialect. Zenodotus is thought to have been the first to divide the <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title> each into twenty-four books. In earlier times this division was unknown. So, for example, Herodotus (ii. 116) speaks of <title>Iliad</title> vi. 289-292 as <foreign lang="greek">ἐν Διομήδεος ἀριστείῃ</foreign>. Aelian (<title>Varia Hist.</title> xiii. 14) writes in detail of this ancient custom of reference by the subject of each particular portion of the poems. The ancient titles are preserved, though with some possible inaccuracies and no definite authority, as the headings of the books in ordinary editions of the poems. The division into books became necessary at this particular time, because then parchment was replaced by papyrus as the ordinary writing material. The comparatively frail papyrus was not suited for long rolls. Hence the works of Plato, Xenophon, Thucydides, and Herodotus were divided, also. Zenodotus seems to have composed no commentary to accompany his edition of the poems, but tradition preserved his views of certain passages. He was not led to reject or change for grammatical reasons, but seems to have been guided in many changes rather by a sense of propriety. Thus he rejected <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3. 424" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>iii. 424</bibl>, where Aphrodité took a chair and set it for Helen, for the goddess to do menial service was <foreign lang="greek">ἀπρεπές</foreign> in his eyes; verses <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 28" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 28</bibl>-30 were unworthy of a king; in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 260" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>i. 260</bibl>, where Nestor says, “I have been associated with better men than you” (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρείοσιν ἠέ περ ὑμῖν</foreign>), Zenodotus read “than we” (<foreign lang="greek">ἡμῖν</foreign>), in order to make the expression more courteous. But the work of this critic is coming to honour, and it is at present fashionable in some quarters to praise him at the expense of Aristarchus.</p>
 <p>The edition of Zenodotus formed the basis of that of his successor, Aristophanes of Byzantium, a little after B.C. 200, who is noteworthy as the first to introduce to general use the marks of accentuation and the signs of quantity, which are still in use. His chief work was in lexicography.</p>
 <p>Unquestionably the greatest of the literary critics of Alexandria was Aristarchus, who was born in the island of Samothrace, but came to Alexandria and studied under Aristophanes, whom he succeeded in the care of the library. He prepared two revised editions of the Homeric text, with critical marks in the margin, and wrote eight hundred tracts on many subjects, largely connected with our poet. He founded a school of critics which continued active until the time of the early 
<pb n="838" /><cb /> Roman emperors. Many of his notes have been preserved to us in the Greek scholia, and prove his learning and his caution. The watchword and battle-cry of his school was <hi rend="italic">analogy</hi>, opposed to the rival school of the Stoic Crates at Pergamum, who was more free in the admission of <hi rend="italic">anomalies</hi> in the construction of sentences and in the formation and meaning of words. Crates indulged in allegorical interpretation, paying little attention to grammatical studies, and making Homer a philosopher and an orator, while Aristarchus was more conservative and sober in his views.</p>
 <p>The basis of our scholia to the <title>Iliad</title> is an epitome made about A.D. 200, of four works. Of these the most important was a work by Didymus (called <foreign lang="greek">Χαλκέντερος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Βιβλιολάθας</foreign> from his unwearied industry and literary productivity), of the time of Augustus, in which Didymus aimed at giving a full report of the readings of the editions of Aristarchus, in so far as they varied from others. Next in importance was a work by an earlier contemporary, Aristonicus, who endeavoured to explain the use of the critical signs of Aristarchus, and the reasons for their employment in each case. Less full and important were the extracts from a treatise by Herodian on Accentuation (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ Ἰλιακὴ Προσῳδία</foreign>) and one by Nicanor on Punctuation (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Στιγμῆς</foreign>). The epitome of these four works has suffered serious losses in its transmission to the present time, and considerable additional matter of little value and authority has been added. The component parts of these scholia have been carefully analyzed and separated, and scholars no longer speak of the statement of the scholiast, but of that of Didymus, of Nicanor, etc. The extant scholia to the <title>Odyssey</title> are far less extensive and important than those to the <title>Iliad.</title></p>
 <p>The Homeric text of the MSS. does not seem to be so distinctly under the control of the text of Aristarchus as was to be expected. In many particulars it differs from his editions—so widely that it seems that the vulgate text was only indirectly and slightly influenced by his work. Many scholars now regard the restoration of the Aristarchean text as the ultimate, or at least the immediate, aim of Homeric text-criticism. But Bekker's edition of 1858 attempted to present the text as it was sung—not as it stood in the old MSS.—inserting the lost <hi rend="italic">vau</hi> where the editor believed it had once been pronounced. Bekker had been preceded by a wholly unscientific attempt of the same kind in 1820, by R. Payne Knight, who inserted <hi rend="italic">vaus</hi> with more zeal than discretion, printing as the title of the <title>Iliad</title> <foreign lang="greek">ϝΙΔϝΙΑΣ</foreign>, and Tydeus as <foreign lang="greek">ΤΥϝΔΕϝΣ</foreign>, but who with many absurdities had many ideas which have been confirmed by modern investigations. Bekker has been followed by others, notably Nauck, who has made a scientific edition of Homer such as he believes the poems to have been before the forms were subjected to later Attic influence.</p>
 <p>That the Homeric text of Plato and Aristotle was not exactly like that of the present day is extremely probable, but these seem to have quoted so freely that exact inferences are difficult. The view that they quoted from memory is strengthened by the fact that each of the two makes a careless reference to the Homeric story: Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 3. 405" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>iii. 405</bibl> e) speaks of Eurypylus where he means Machaon, confusing two similar incidents in the same book of the <title>Iliad</title> (xi. 638-641, 822-848); and Aristotle (<title>Nicom. Eth.</title> ii. 1109, a 31) puts into the <cb /> mouth of Calypso a command of Odysseus which was given in accordance with advice of Circé ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 12. 219" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xii. 219</bibl>). In the summer of 1891 the British Museum published a collation of several very ancient papyrus texts of the <title>Iliad</title>, containing fragments of several hundred lines. With the exception of two or three details, the most important teaching of these MSS., one of which is from the very beginning of our era, is that the ordinary texts of to-day are rather more accurate and intelligible than those of two thousand years ago, but certain verses may not have been recognized as Homeric then which are in modern texts.</p>
 <p>For the last century the vexed and ever-burning Homeric Question has been with regard to the composition and original form of the Homeric poems—whether they were the creations of one poetic genius or the remnants of the songs of many bards; whether their composition was organic or atomic; whether they can be compared with Vergil's <title>Aeneid</title> and Milton's <title>Paradise Lost</title>, or whether they were at first only short, scattered songs, grouped around central personages and events, and gradually developed into longer poems with unity. The heat and length of the discussion have made clear the fact that the question is difficult, and no hypothesis has been presented free from grave objections. Scholars are more nearly agreed than half a century ago, however. Probably no one who has a right to an opinion on the subject now holds to the strict unity of the poems in the old sense—that all of the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> was composed by one man—yet comparatively few would deny a certain unity in the poems, however it was secured. The ancient Alexandrians had their Separatists (<foreign lang="greek">χωρίζοντες</foreign>), Xeno and Hellanicus, who denied that the <title>Odyssey</title> was composed by the author of the <title>Iliad</title>, and Perizonius in 1684 called attention to the late use of writing for literary purposes. The great Bentley in 1713 said that “Homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small earnings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment; the <title>Iliad</title> he made for the men, and the <title>Odysseïs</title> for the other sex. These loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about five hundred years after.” Vico of Naples in 1725 expressed his view that Homer never existed—that he was the personification of the early songs of the Greeks. Robert Wood, in <bibl default="NO"><title>An Essay on the Original Genius of Homer</title> (1769)</bibl>, declared his belief that the art of writing was not known to Homer. But the modern discussion of the Homeric Question dates from the <title>Prolegomena ad Homerum</title> of Friedrich August Wolf, published in 1795. The <title>Prolegomena</title> excited much attention, and probably has had greater influence than any other work on the methods of historical and philological study, although its ideas were not wholly novel. The poet Herder and the philologist Heyne each claimed that his thunder had been stolen. The book owed its great success largely to its clear and attractive presentation of the subject, and it is more valuable now for its method than for its particular arguments. Wolf planned to give a critical history of the Homeric poems through six periods, the first of which extended from the composition of the poems (about B.C. 950, according to him) to the age of Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens in the sixth century B.C., who, according to an uncertain tradition, first collected and arranged them in 
<pb n="839" /><cb />
 their present form; the second period extended from Pisistratus to Zenodotus, the earliest of the Alexandrian critics. Wolf never completed his work beyond these first two periods. He attempted to show (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) that the Homeric poems were not committed to writing by the poet, but were intrusted to the memory of the rhapsodes, who were gathered in schools, like the Hebrew prophets; thus before the poems were written they were exposed to many and unintentional changes—from lapse of memory, and from a singer's desire to improve a passage or suit it more perfectly to a special occasion. Writing was unknown in Greece in Homer's time, and no class of readers existed for whom a poem should be written. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) After the poems had been committed to writing, many more additional changes were made in them, in order to remove inconsistencies and to give them the polish of an age advanced in culture and poetic art. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> in their present form are due not to the poetic genius of Homer, but to the intelligence of a later age—to the united efforts of Pisistratus and the poets of his court. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The songs themselves, of which the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> are composed, are not by the same poet. These last two theses were never publicly discussed by Wolf in detail. He only urged that if the poems were not to be committed to writing at the time when they were composed, the sougs were not originally parts of one long work; no one would have thought of making a poem which could not be read and which was too long to be sung or recited at a single sitting. A bond of union would be valueless between lays which were to be sung in no regular order on different occasions. The Homeric poems unquestionably possess a certain unity beyond what is found in Hesiod or in the late poet Quintus Smyrnaeus, but this unity must be due to the editors of the Pisistratean age. Discrepancies are found which could not occur in a single poem, but might very well be overlooked in the combination of independent lays. Entire rhapsodies (e. g. <title>Iliad</title> x.) seem to be due to some other than the poet of the greater part of the <title>Iliad.</title></p>
 <p>The views of Wolf were received with intense interest, but with varied approval. The poet Schiller said that the man was a barbarian who would tear asunder the Homeric poems and believe that they were put together long after their composition. Goethe, while at first an enthusiastic admirer of the <title>Prolegomena</title>, soon declared that he believed in the unity of the <title>Iliad</title> more heartily than ever. On the whole, however, the work of Wolf was convincing, at least in large part, to most scholars of Germany. Theologians received it with special interest, on account of the applications of Wolf's principles to the study of the Old Testament. But a reaction took place. Opponents urged that the use of writing in Greece was much earlier than Wolf claimed; but they made the fatal concession that such long poems would be impossible without the aid of writing. Both sides claimed too much. Writing was certainly known in Greece earlier than Wolf allowed, but was not used for extensive literary purposes until long after the time alleged by his opponents. The power of the human memory to retain accurately long poems had been underrated. The external arguments against the original unity of the Homeric poems have yielded rather than advanced since Wolf's time. The evidence in support of the <cb /> story of the work of Pisistratus in collecting and arranging the scattered Homeric poems is considered weak, as well as that for the existence of schools of rhapsodists corresponding to the schools of the prophets.</p>
 <p>Only a beginning had been made of the attempt to disprove the unity of the Homeric poems from internal evidence when Lachmann, of Berlin, in 1837, applied to the <title>Iliad</title> the analysis which had been applied not much earlier to the <title>Nibelungenlied.</title> He set to work to discover contradictions and inconsistencies which would indicate the different authorship of different parts. The discussion of the unity of the poems was conducted mainly on his principles for half a century, and no one now lays stress on the external evidence, one way or the other. In the first book of the <title>Iliad</title> he determined an original lay (1-347), complete in itself, and two independent and inconsistent continuations (430-492; and 348-429, 493-611). The beginning of the second book (he says) cannot have been part of the same lay as the close of the first book; at the close of book i., Zeus sleeps, with Hera by his side, while at the beginning of book ii., Zeus cannot sleep and has an interview with the Dream God, in which he tells much that he would not have Hera know. In the third day of battle, which begins book xi. 1 and continues through book xviii. 240, the sun comes twice to the zenith (at xi. 86 and xvi. 777, nearly 4000 verses later). The twenty-third book of the <title>Iliad</title> cannot have been intended to follow immediately upon the twenty-second—the one ending, “Thus she spake weeping, and the women groaned in response,” while the next begins, “Thus these were groaning throughout the city.” Following such indications, Lachmann marked out the boundaries of eighteen distinct lays in the <title>Iliad.</title> Köchly, following in Lachmann's footsteps, published in 1851 an edition of the <title>Iliad</title>, in sixteen lays (omitting books x., xix.-xxiii., and parts of some others)—not agreeing with Lachmann in the divisions so well as in the number of the songs. The advocates of the theory that the Homeric poems are but a conglomeration of independent lays have not succeeded in coming to essential agreement with regard to the original songs. Their lines of cleavage do not agree. Contradictions certainly exist: Odysseus' hair is blonde ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 13. 431" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xiii. 431</bibl>), but black ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 16. 176" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xvi. 176</bibl>). Diomed and Odysseus are seriously wounded and retire from the conflict ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 369" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 369</bibl> foll.<bibl n="Hom. Il. 428" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 428</bibl> foll.), but two days later take part in the games in honour of Patroclus—Odysseus wrestling with Telamonian Ajax ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 709" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 709</bibl>), and winning the prize in the foot-race ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 778" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 778</bibl>). Most noted of all is the case of Pylaemenes; he is slain at <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5. 576" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>v. 576</bibl>, but follows the corpse of his son from the battle ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13. 658" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xiii. 658</bibl>). Some inconsistencies may be considered as trifles about which the poet did not concern himself; he was composing for hearers rather than for critical readers who can turn backward and forward, and compare statements. Other inconsistencies may have been caused by interpolations; the incident of Pylaemenes in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13. 658" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xiii. 658</bibl> may have been added by a later poet in order to give increased pathos to the scene. Possibly the Homeric Greeks were not so much disturbed as some moderns at such inconsistencies. Similar discrepancies are found in the works of Vergil and other poets.</p>
 <p>In 1846, the historian Grote, declaring that “the 
<pb n="840" /><cb />
 idea that a poem as we read it grew out of atoms not originally designed for the places which they now occupy, involves us in new and inextricable difficulties when we seek to elucidate either the mode of coalescence or the degree of existing unity,” proposed the theory that the present <title>Iliad</title> was made up by the combination of an original <title>Iliad</title> (books ii.-vii., ix., x., xxiii.-xxiv.) with an <title>Achilleïd</title> (books i., viii., xi.-xxii.). This latter poem on the Wrath of Achilles gives all that is “really necessary to complete the programme in the opening proem of the poem.”</p>
 <p>In 1878, Professor Geddes of Aberdeen, following in Grote's footsteps, declared that “the Homeric corpus of <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> falls asunder into two great sections, on the one hand the <title>Achilleïd</title>, and on the other the non-Achilleïd, <seg lang="la">plus</seg> the Odyssey.” “A poet, who is also the author of the <title>Odyssey</title>, has engrafted on a more ancient poem, the <title>Achilleïd</title>, splendid and vigorous saplings of his own, transforming and enlarging it into an <title>Iliad.</title>” This view was maintained by many indications: Achilles is more gentle in the Odyssean books; Helen is not mentioned in the <title>Achilleïd;</title> the dog is more honoured in the Odyssean books, the horse in the <title>Achilleïd</title>, etc.</p>
 <p>Organic development from a brief epic poem was claimed for the <title>Odyssey</title> by Kirchhoff of Berlin, in 1859. He considers the original part to be the old <title>Return</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Νόστος</foreign>) <title>of Odysseus</title>, of just 1200 verses; to this simple story was added a longer story of 3560 verses, narrating the adventures of Odysseus after his return to Ithaca; still later were added (7185 verses) the <title>Telemachia</title>, or account of the journey of Telemachus to Pylus and Sparta, the experiences of Odysseus in Phaeacia, and his adventures in the cave of Polyphemus, in the island of Circé, in the realm of Hades, etc.</p>
 <p>Christ of Munich published in 1884 an edition of the <title>Iliad</title> in which he divided the poem into forty lays, and indicated by the use of four different styles of Greek type his view of the relative order of composition of the different parts of the poem. Immediately after the first book he places the eleventh, the Bravery of Agamemnon, believing that the intermediate books were composed after the poet saw what a rich vein he had struck, and to what a magnificent growth his germ might be developed. He holds that most of the poem proves a poet revolving a great plan in his mind, and arranging the parts to form a whole.</p>
 <p>Von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff published in 1884 an important work on this subject, <title>Homerische Untersuchungen</title>, dedicated to the well-known Biblical scholar Wellhausen. Just as Wolf's <title>Prolegomena</title> <cb /> stimulated the investigation of the historical sources and of the age of the Old Testament Scriptures, so the method of the recent analysis of the Pentateuch has been applied to the Homeric poems. Wilamowitz rejects Lachmann's lays as being fragments, unintelligible when separated. He bases his work upon that of Kirchhoff, yet rejects many of the latter's views. He follows him in putting the <title>Odyssey</title> in the front of the discussion. Until Kirchhoff, no scholar had seriously attempted the critical dissection of this poem, of which the artistic plan was not doubted. Two of Wilamowitz's conclusions are that the <title>Telemachia </title>( <bibl n="Homer Od. 2. 1" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>ii. 1</bibl>-iv. 619) was composed in Asia Minor, and that the <title>Odyssey</title> was brought into its present form in Greece proper —probably near Corinth or in Euboea.</p>
 <p>The Homeric Question is clearly full of difficulties. No theory has been proposed which meets with general acceptance. The poems doubtless contain a great mass of very ancient material. Professor Percy Gardner writes, in his <bibl default="NO"><title>New Chapters in Greek History</title> (1892)</bibl>, “There is a broad line dividing mythical from political Hellas, a line which seems to coincide with the great break made in the continuity of Hellas by the Dorian invasion. . . . The Homeric poetry may have been reduced to form after the splendour of the Ionian and Achaean chiefs had passed away. . . . In using the name of Homer, we do not, of course, assert that the Homeric poems had a single author. But we do assert the antiquity of those poems. Homer reflects the pre-historic age of Greece as truly as does Herodotus the Greece of the Persian Wars, or Pausanias the Greece of the age of the Antonines.” The poet does not profess to have seen Priam's Troy; he is clearly conscious that he belongs to a degenerate age, and that he is dependent on the muse for his information. No one supposes that the poems are an accurate record of a particular war. The recent excavations, however, establish the fact that at Mycenae, the home of the Homeric Agamemnon, and on the shore of the Hellespont, the home of the Homeric Priam, stood at the same period, flourishing from about B.C. 1400 to about B.C. 1000, cities of wealth and power, of similar culture. A war between these cities, which may have suggested the Homeric story, is by no means an impossibility. The details, however, and perhaps every name of a person, are due to the poet's imagination. The view that the poems were essentially in their present condition before the historical period in Greece began, early in the eighth century B.C., is moderate.</p>
 <p>The Homeric dialect is artificial—that is, such as was never spoken by any Greek tribe. It contains 
<pb n="841" /><cb /> many ancient elements, but is far from being the ancestor of all the later historical dialects. It is not even the source of the Attic or Ionic dialects. The Aeolic element in it is so strong as to suggest to Fick the view that the older parts of the poems were composed in the Aeolic dialect and were afterwards translated into that of the Ionic. The formulaic character of many of the Aeolic words and phrases, the large number of Homeric proper names found in historical times in Northern Greece, the traditions with regard to the seats of the Pierian Muses, and the prominence given to the Thessalian hero, Achilles, make probable the view that epic poetry was first cultivated by the Aeolians in Northern Greece, but was afterwards brought to perfection by the Ionians in Asia Minor. The dialect certainly indicates a long course of development. Obsolete words and forms were retained by the poets in certain connections after they had been dropped from the ordinary speech of the people. Certain late forms appear in the ordinary texts in sufficient number to suggest to Paley the theory that the poems were brought into their present form in the age of Pericles at Athens; but most of these forms can be explained easily as the work of a careless copyist, who substituted a form which he heard every day for one which was found only in old poems—just as a halfeducated man would do to-day in copying the works of Chaucer, unless he were specially warned and trained to be accurate in this matter. If the Homeric poems were thoroughly worked over, revamped, in the time of Solon or of Pericles, some clear trace would have been left of the culture and political relations of that time. A strong indication of the falsity of the story that Pisistratus gathered the poems and caused interpolations to be made to the glory of Athens, is the simple fact that Athens is so insignificant in the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title> If the unity of the poems were really due to Pisistratus, and he ordered the poets of his court to insert passages which would honour Athens, we should find greater distinction given to Athenian heroes and more myths of the Attic cycle. The two or three verses assigned by the ancient critics to Athenian interpolators are absolutely trifling.</p>
 <p>Fortunately the Homeric poems <hi rend="italic">exist</hi>, even though scholars have not settled the question when and how they came into being. Destructive criticism has not been able to disturb the fact that they remain the greatest epic poems the world has seen— admired by many ages and peoples of different civilizations. They stand unrivalled. In comparison with them the vast epics of India are as shapeless as the Hindoo idols, and are in their luxuriance like to a tropical jungle; while the work of Vergil and of Milton, who take Homer as their master, is artificial and unnatural in comparison with his—the “clearest-souled of men.”</p>

The <seg lang="la">ius honorum</seg> was a part of the rights of one who was a free citizen and might be withheld when all the other rights were granted ( <bibl n="Tac.

 <p>(4) <title>Cursus honorum</title> is an expression of Roman official life which may be defined as the career of public service through which a citizen must pass before attaining to the position of the highest rank. In the early Roman Republic there existed in an informal way a principle of official promotion by which those who had held inferior magistracies were understood to be eligible for higher positions after the lapse of a certain interval of time (Callist. <title>Dig.</title> 50, 4, 14, 5). The order, <seg lang="la">certus ordo magistratuum</seg>, in which the various magistracies should be held, was, however, formally defined in B.C. 180 by the Lex Villia Annalis. The <seg lang="la">cursus honorum</seg> thus legally determined consisted of the quaestorship, curule aedileship, praetorship, consulship. A preliminary military service of ten years was required before the career of magistracies could be begun. Since enrollment by the censors took place at the census next following the attainment of the age of seventeen years, allowing for the ten years of military service, we may place the earliest age at which the quaestorship could be held as twenty-eight years. An interval of at least two years was required between the holding one office and the following, so that the aedileship could be held at thirty-one years, the praetorship at thirty-four, and the consulship at thirty-seven. Since the holding of the curule aedileship was optional, the praetorship might directly follow the quaestorship, and the consulship might thus be reached at thirty-four years.</p>
 <p>The principle of an <seg lang="la">ordo honorum</seg> found, however, its most important application in the development of the imperial government under Augustus and his successors.</p>
 <p>In the imperial period there were three careers of official service. The republican magistracies formed the <seg lang="la">cursus honorum</seg> for those of senatorial rank—i. e. senators, sons of senators, or those raised to senatorial rank by the emperor, all possessing the requisite property of one million sesterces.</p>
 <p>To a select body of the knights invested by the emperor with membership in the equestrian troop through the conferring of the knight's horse, were assigned the offices of administration, the various procuratorships and <seg lang="la">praefecturae</seg> which formed the equestrian <seg lang="la">cursus honorum.</seg></p>
 <p>To the commonalty were assigned the subordinate offices, civil and military. <hi rend="center"><hi rend="SmallCaps">senatorial cursus honorum</hi>.</hi> <cb /></p>
 <p>I. Preliminary service. <lb /> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Annual tenure of one of a group of minor offices, known as <seg lang="la">vigintiviri: triumvir capitalis, triumvir monetalis, quattuorvir viarum curandarum, decemvir stlitibus iudicandis.</seg> <lb /> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) A year's service as <seg lang="la">tribunus militum laticlavius.</seg></p>
 <p>II. Quaestorship—at twenty-five years. <lb />Interval of at least one year.</p>
 <p>III. Aedileship or tribunate of the plebs. <lb />Interval of at least one year.</p>
 <p>IV. Praetorship—at thirty years. <lb />Interval of at least two years.</p>
 <p>V. Consulship. <lb />A patrician being ineligible for the tribunate of the plebs or the plebeian aedileship could pass directly from the quaestorship to the praetorship. <hi rend="center"><hi rend="SmallCaps">equestrian cursus honorum</hi>.</hi></p>
 <p>I. Preliminary service. <lb /> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Military service. No special military service appears to have been regularly required, although Claudius determined upon three positions—(1) <seg lang="la">praefectura cohortis;</seg></p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">praefectura alae;</seg></p>
 <p>(3) <seg lang="la">tribunatus legionis;</seg> and these <seg lang="la">tres militiae equestres</seg> became the usual preliminary service in the second century. In the inscriptions the <seg lang="la">tribunatus</seg> regularly holds the second place. <lb /> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Civil service. Through the reforms of Hadrian, training in state affairs was recognized as equivalent to service in the army—e. g. those who had served as <seg lang="la">advocati fisci</seg> or <seg lang="la">ab commentariis praefecti praetorio</seg> were eligible for the procuratorships and praefectures.</p>
 <p>II. Procuratorships of various kinds and grades.</p>
 <p>III. Praefecturae. <lb />The highest offices open to those of the equestrian order given in ascending order were: <title>praefectura classis, praefectura vigilum, praefectura annonae, praefectura Aegypti, praefectura praetorio.</title> <hi rend="center"><hi rend="SmallCaps">officials of the third class</hi>.</hi></p>
 <p>These were of great number and variety, being made up mainly of subordinate officers of administration in Rome and the provinces, attendants of public officials, officers of the army and the fleets, magistrates of the coloniae and municipia, and the officers of the collegia. The inscriptions show that these subordinate offices were arranged in a <seg lang="la">cursus honorum</seg> on the same principle prevailing in the senatorial and equestrian <seg lang="la">cursus.</seg></p>

In Homer, who gives them neither genealogy nor names, they are mentioned as handmaidens of Zeus, intrusted with the guarding of the gates of heaven and Olympus—in other words, with watching the clouds. Hesiod calls them the daughters of Zeus and Themis, who watch over the field operations of mankind; their names are Eunomia (Good Order), Diké (Justice), and Irené (Peace), names which show that the divinities of the three ordinary seasons of the world of nature—Spring, Summer, and Winter—are also, as daughters of Themis, appointed to superintend the moral world of human life. This is especially the case with Diké, who is the goddess who presided over legal order, and, like Themis, was enthroned by the side of Zeus. According to Hesiod, she immediately acquaints him with all unjust judicial decisions, so that he may punish them. In the tragic poets she is men<figure id="fig.00843">

<head orig="Horatius">Horatius</head>

 <p> (1) The name of three brave Roman brothers, who fought, according to the old Roman legends, against the Curiatii, three Alban brothers, about 667 years before the commencement of our era. Mutual acts of violence committed by the citizens of Rome and Alba had given rise to a war. The armies were drawn up against each other at the Fossa Cluilia, where it was agreed to avert a battle by a combat of three brothers on either side —namely, the Horatii and Curiatii. It is evident that we have here types of the two nations regarded as sisters and of the three tribes in each. In the first onset, two of the Horatii were slain by their opponents; but the third brother, by joining address to valour, obtained a victory over all his antagonists. Pretending to fly from the field of battle, he separated the three Curiatii, and then, attacking them one by one, slew them successively. As he returned triumphant to the city, his sister Horatia, who had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii, met and reproached her brother bitterly for having slain her intended husband. Horatius, incensed at this, stabbed his sister to the heart, exclaiming, “So perish every Roman woman who bewails a foe.” For this murder he was adjudged by the duumvirs to be scourged with covered head and hanged on the accursed tree. Horatius appealed to his peers, the burghers or <seg lang="la">populus;</seg> and his father pronounced him guiltless, or he would have punished him by the paternal power. The populus acquitted Horatius, but prescribed a symbolical punishment. With veiled head, led by his father, Horatius passed under a yoke or gibbet—<seg lang="la">tigillum sororium</seg>, “sisters' gibbet.” (See Livy, i. 26.)</p>

Manlius Torquatus ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>iii. 21</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 1</bibl>; <bibl n="Hor. Epod. 13" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epod.</title>13</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Epod. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> Epod., 6</bibl>). His father, who was a freedman of the Horatian family, had gained considerable property as a <seg lang="la">coactor</seg>, a name applied to the servant of the moneybrokers, who attended at sales at auction, and collected the money from the purchasers ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 6" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 6</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 86" default="NO"> Sat., 86</bibl>). With these gains he purchased a farm in the neighbourhood of Venusia, on the banks of the Aufidus. In this place Horace appears to have lived until his eleventh or twelfth year, when his father, dissatisfied with the country school of Flavius, removed with his son to Rome, where he was placed under the care

 of a celebrated teacher, Orbilius Pupillus, of Beneventum, whose life has been written by Suetonius. After studying the ancient Latin poets, Horace acquired the Greek language. He also enjoyed, during the course of his education, the advice and assistance of his father, who appears to have been a sensible man, and who is mentioned by his son with the greatest esteem and respect. It is probable that, soon after he had assumed the <seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg> at the age of seventeen, he went to Athens to pursue his studies, where he appears to have remained till the breaking out of the Civil War during the second triumvirate. In this contest he joined the army of Brutus, was promoted to the rank of military tribune, and was present at the battle of Philippi, his flight from which he compares to a similar act on the part of the Greek poet Alcaeus.</p>
 <p>Though the life of Horace was spared by the imperial party, his paternal property at Venusia was confiscated, and he repaired to Rome, with the hope of obtaining a living by his literary exertions. Some of his poems attracted the notice of Vergil and Varius, who introduced him to Maecenas, and the liberality of that statesman quickly relieved the poet from all pecuniary difficulties. From this eventful epoch the current of his life flowed on in a smooth and gentle course. Satisfied with the competency which his patron had bestowed, Horace declined the offers made him by Augustus, to take him into his service as private secretary, and steadily resisted the temptation thus held out of rising to wealth and political consideration; advantages which would have been dearly purchased by the sacrifice of his independence. That he was really independent in the noblest sense of the word, in freedom of thought and action, is evidenced by that beautiful epistle (i. 7) to Maecenas, in which he states that if the favour of his patron is to be secured by a slavish renunciation of his own habits and feelings, he will at once say farewell to fortune and welcome poverty. <cb /></p>
 <p>Not long after his introduction to Maecenas the journey to Brundisium took place ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl>), and the gift of his Sabine farm soon followed. Rendered independent by the bounty of Maecenas, high in the favour of Augustus, courted by the proudest patricians of Rome, and blessed in the friendship of his brother poets, Vergil, Tibullus, and Varius, it is difficult to conceive a state of more perfect temporal felicity than Horace must have enjoyed. This happiness was first seriously interrupted by the death of Vergil, which was shortly succeeded by that of Tibullus. These losses must have sunk deeply into his mind. The solemn thoughts and serious studies which, in the first epistle of his first book, he declares shall henceforward occupy his time, were, if we may judge from the second epistle of the second book, confirmed by those sad warnings of the frail tenure of existence. The severest blow, however, which Horace had to encounter, was inflicted by the death of his early <figure id="fig.00844.2">
<head orig="Horace. (From a Gem in the British Museum.)">Horace. (From a Gem in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure> friend and best patron Maecenas. He had declared that he could never survive the loss of one who was “part of his soul” ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 5</bibl>), and his prediction was verified. The death of the poet occurred only a few weeks after that of his friend, on the 27th of November, B.C. 8, when he had nearly completed his fiftyeighth year. His remains were deposited next to those of Maecenas, on the Esquiline Hill.</p>
 <p>When at Rome, Horace lived in a small and plainly-furnished mansion on the Esquiline. When he left the city, he either betook himself to his Sabine farm or his villa at Tibur, the modern Tivoli. When in the country, as the whim seized him, he 
<pb n="845" /><cb />
 would either study hard or be luxuriously idle. The country was his favourite abode, and here he displayed all the genial simplicity of his nature.</p>
 <p>If we may believe Horace himself, his own preference was for a country life; and some of the truest poetry that he ever wrote deals with themes drawn from his love of rural scenes— the peaceful meadows of Apulia, the Bandusian fountain, the cattle resting in the flickering shade through the long summer afternoon, the siesta by the brook-side, the cool vistas of the forest glades with the young deer browsing among the trees. His own homely tastes are delightfully set forth in the passages where he tells of his sitting about the fire at evening with his rustic neighbours, exchanging stories and cracking jokes over the mellow wine.</p>
 <p>Horace is described as short and stout, so that Augustus rallied him on his corpulency; of a rather quick temper, yet easily placated; and given to ease and the enjoyment of the good things of life. This disposition is perfectly reflected in his writings, which embody a genial, if not very deep, philosophy of life, and a good sense which robbed Epicureanism of its selfishness and Stoicism of its sourness and severity.</p>
 <p>The productions of Horace are divided into Odes, Epodes, Satires, and Epistles. The Epodes (<title>Epodi</title>) are the earliest of his works, and are written in various forms of iambic and dactylic verse. They were not published as a collection until B.C. 29, after the publication of his first book of Satires (<title>Sermones</title>), which had appeared about the year B.C. 35, dedicated to Maecenas. At about the time of the publication of the Epodes appeared the second book of Satires. The Odes (<title>Carmina</title>) were written in part as early as B.C. 29, but their formal appearance in three books is to be assigned to the year B.C. 20 or thereabouts. These three books were also dedicated to Maecenas. Following them came a continuation of the Satires in a new form, that of letters addressed each to a single person, and called Epistles (<title>Epistulae</title>). These are in two books, the first having been published soon after the first publication of the Odes, and the second not long before the poet's death in B.C. 8. In B.C. 17, the <title>Carmen Saeculare</title> or Secular Hymn was composed at the request of Augustus for the celebration of the Ludi Saeculares (q. v.). Horace likewise, being in a way the Poet Laureate of Augustus, celebrated the victories of the emperor's stepsons, Tiberius and Drusus, in several new Odes, which he published with a number of others, as a fourth book of Odes in B.C. 13. The famous bit of literary criticism, the <title>Epistula ad Pisones</title>, usually known as the <title>Ars Poetica</title>, and perhaps unfinished, is of uncertain date, but is to be assigned with much probability to the year B.C. 20.</p>
 <p>Horace, as a poet, does not show the inspiration and <title>Geist</title> that would rank him with the great masters of lyric verse—Pindar, Alcaeus, Sappho— whom he imitates; and he is himself thoroughly aware of his own poetic limitations. When he attempts the flight of the Theban eagle and when he writes in his <seg lang="la">rôle</seg> of Poet Laureate, he is never at his best; but, like Tennyson in his official verse, invariably suggests a person ill at ease <cb /> <figure id="fig.00845">

</figure> over a perfunctory task. His temperament and tastes marked out for him a far different sphere, in which he is inimitable. When he gets away from battles and triumphs, and gods and heroes, and the whole machinery of Olympus, and turns to the familiar world in which he lives, he plays with a master hand upon the chords that vibrate in the breast of all men. Tenderness, humour, a lively and picturesque fancy, a sympathetic love of external nature in her familiar aspects, a keen insight into human nature in its varying moods—all these are his in a high degree, and joined with them is an undercurrent of occasional melancholy that not infrequently touches the source of tears. In those Odes where he depicts the lighter side of love, the genial intercourse of friends, and natural scenery, or in which he sets forth his amiable philosophy of life, he is quite inimitable. Words cannot do justice to the exquisite polish of his verse, the crispness and terse vigour of his phrases, and the perfect choice of words, which Petronius, in the following century, characterized as <title>Horatii curiosa felicitas.</title> He has filled the pages of modern literature with a host of sparkling epigrams, phrases, and proverbial lines—“jewels five words long”—more numerous, in fact, than those that have been taken from all the rest of Latin literature put together. No other writer in any language so abounds in pregnant phrases. His <seg lang="la">carpe diem</seg> is an epitome in two words of the whole practical teaching of Epicureanism. His <seg lang="la">nil desperandum</seg>, twisted out of its context, has almost become an English phrase. So, too, the expressions <title>consule Planco— damnosa quid non—nunc vino pellite curas—post equitem sedet atra cura—non omnis moriar—semper avarus eget—sapere aude—nil admirari—sub iudice lis est—disiecti membra poetae</title>—and a hundred others.</p>
 <p>It is in his Satires and Epistles that the true Horace is most clearly seen, freed from the uncomfortable trappings of the grand style, and, as it were, chatting at ease among his friends. Here he most winningly sets forth his shrewd and kindly views of men and things, laughing good-humouredly at the foibles of his friends and at his 
<pb n="846" /><cb />
 own as well, like Thackeray, except that in the laugh of Horace there is no subacid tone of even a pretended cynicism. The whole tenour of his teaching is moderation—the <seg lang="la">mediocritas aurea</seg>, the <seg lang="la">modus in rebus</seg>—which he preaches incessantly alike to the ambitious, the pleasure-loving, and the philosopher. Not even virtue itself is to be pursued beyond what is reasonable. This is essentially the philosophy of “good form,” of the man of the world, enlivened by a sense of humour that is fatal alike to the fanaticism of the “crank” and the priggish solemnity of the Philistine. It is the philosophy of the average man, and it explains the constant popularity of Horace in all ages and all nations, and the fact that he is today, at the end of the nineteenth century, the most modern writer that literature can show us. He, more than any other, makes antiquity live for us again; and, stripping off the superficial differences of time and place and language, flashes upon the mind a conviction of the essential unity of the present and the past. He is thus the most human of all the classic writers, and the one whose wit and wisdom linger in the mind of the most idle student long after the lines of Aeschylus and Vergil and even Homer have been forgotten. Hence we find him admired, translated, and imitated by men of such different types as Pope, Byron, Gladstone, and Eugene Field. His nearest representative in English literature is Pope; but, as Mr. Mackail well says, to suggest a true parallel we must unite in thought the excellence of Pope and Gray with the easy wit and cultured grace of Addison.</p>
 <p>From an early date Horace's poems were used in Roman schools as a text-book, and were expounded by Roman scholars, especially by Acron and Porphyrion. His use as a school-text has perpetuated the order in which his works are now always printed, that being the order in which the Roman school-boys read them. As Horace has been continuously popular, there exist a very large number of MSS. (about 250) of the text—none, however, older than the ninth century A.D. The oldest is the Codex Bernensis (denoted as B), written in Ireland. This is incomplete. A separate source of Horace is represented by the Codex Blandinius <figure id="fig.00846">
<head orig="Q. Horatius Flaccus. (From a Gem. )">Q. Horatius Flaccus. (From a Gem. )</head>

(See <ref type="cross" target="crosscruquius">Cruquius</ref>.) The best representative of this “family” is probably the Codex Gothanus (G), dating from the year 1456. The Horatian MSS. are enumerated in Keller and Holder's preface.</p>

<head orig="Horologium">Horologium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὡρολόγιον</foreign>). A name given to various instruments by means of which the ancients measured the time of the day and night. The earliest and simplest horologia of which mention is made were called <foreign lang="greek">πόλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γνώμων</foreign>. Herodotus (ii. 109), who ascribes their invention to the Babylonians, mentions the <foreign lang="greek">πόλος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γνώμων</foreign> as two distinct instruments. Both, however, divided the day into twelve parts, and were a kind of sun<figure id="fig.00847">
<head orig="Horologium. (Pompeii.)">Horologium. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> dial. The <foreign lang="greek">γνωμων</foreign>, which was also called <foreign lang="greek">στοιχεῖον</foreign>, was the more simple of the two, and probably the more ancient. It consisted of a staff or pillar standing perpendicular, in a place exposed to the sun (<foreign lang="greek">σκιάθηρον</foreign>), so that the length of its shadow might be easily ascertained. The shadow of the gnomon was measured by feet, which were probably marked on the place where the shadow fell ( <bibl n="Poll.  1. 72" default="NO">Poll.i. 72</bibl>). The gnomon is almost without exception mentioned in connection with the <foreign lang="greek">δεῖπνον</foreign> or the bath; and the time for the former was towards sunset, or at the time when the shadow of the gnomon measured ten or twelve feet ( <title>Eccles.</title> 652, with the Schol.; Poll. l. c.). The longest shadow of the gnomon, at sunrise and sunset, was twelve feet. The time for bathing was when the gnomon threw a shadow of six feet (Lucian, <title>Cronos</title>, <cb /> c. 17; <title>Somn. s. Gall.</title> c. 9). In later times the name gnomon was applied to any kind of sundial, and especially to its finger, which threw the shadow, and thus pointed to the hour. Even the clepsydra is sometimes called gnomon (Athen. ii. p. 42).</p>
 <p>The gnomon was evidently a very imperfect instrument, and it was impossible to divide the day into twelve equal spaces by it. The <foreign lang="greek">πόλος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἡλιοτρόπιον</foreign>, on the other hand, seems to have been a more perfect kind of sundial; but it appears, nevertheless, not to have been much used, as it is but seldom mentioned ( <hi rend="italic">Aristoph. ap.</hi> <bibl n="Poll.  9. 46" default="NO">Poll.ix. 46</bibl>). It consisted of a basin (<foreign lang="greek">λεκανίς</foreign>), in the middle of which the perpendicular staff or finger (<foreign lang="greek">γνώμων</foreign>) was erected, and in it the twelve parts of the day were marked by lines (Lucian, <title>Lexiph.</title> 4).</p>
 <p>Another kind of horologium was the <seg lang="la">clepsydra</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">κλεψύδρα</foreign>). It derived its name from <foreign lang="greek">κλέπτειν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὕδωρ</foreign>, as in its original and simple form it consisted of a vessel with several little openings (<foreign lang="greek">τρυπήματα</foreign>) at the bottom, through which the water contained in it escaped, as it were, by stealth. This instrument seems at first to have been used only for the purpose of measuring the time during which persons were allowed to speak in the courts of justice at Athens. The time of its invention or introduction is not known; but in the age of Aristophanes (see <title>Acharn.</title> 692) it appears to have been in common use. Its form and construction may be seen very clearly from a passage of Aristotle (<title>Problem.</title> xvi. 8). The clepsydra was a hollow globe, probably somewhat flat at the top part, where it had a short neck (<foreign lang="greek">αὐλός</foreign>), like that of a bottle, through which the water was poured into it. This opening might be closed by a lid or stopper (<foreign lang="greek">πῶμα</foreign>), to prevent the water running out at the bottom. The clepsydra which Aristotle had in view was probably not of glass or of any transparent material, but of bronze or brass, so that it could not be seen in the clepsydra itself what quantity of water had escaped. As the time for speaking in the Athenian courts was thus measured by water, the orators frequently use the term <foreign lang="greek">ὕδωρ</foreign> instead of the time allowed to them (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ὕδατι</foreign>, Demosth. <title>De Coron.</title> p. 274. 139). Aeschines (<title>c. Ctesiph.</title> 197), when describing the order in which the several parties were allowed to speak, says that the first water was given to the accuser, the second to the accused, and the third to the 
<pb n="848" /><cb />
 judges. An especial officer (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐφ ὕδωρ</foreign>) was appointed in the courts for the purpose of watching the clepsydra, and stopping it when any documents were read, whereby the speaker was interrupted. The time, and consequently the quantity of water allowed to a speaker depended upon the importance of the case; and we are informed that in a <foreign lang="greek">γραφὴ παραπρεσβείας</foreign> the water allowed to each party amounted to eleven amphorae ( <title>De Fals. Leg.</title> 126), whereas in trials concerning the right of inheritance only one amphora was allowed (Demosth. <title>c. Macart.</title> p. 1052. 8). Those actions in which the time was thus measured to the speakers are called by Pollux (viii. 113) <foreign lang="greek">δίκαι πρὸς ὕδωρ</foreign>: others are termed <foreign lang="greek">δίκαι ἄνευ ὕδατος</foreign>, and in these the speakers were not tied down to a certain space of time.</p>
 <p>The clepsydra used in the courts of justice, however, was, properly speaking, not a horologium; but smaller ones, made of glass, and of the same simple structure, were undoubtedly used very early in families for the purposes of ordinary life, and for dividing the day into twelve equal parts. In these glass clepsydrae the division into twelve parts must have been visible, either on the glass globe itself, or in the basin into which the water flowed. These instruments, however, did not show the time quite correctly all the year round: first, because the water ran out of the clepsydra sometimes quicker and sometimes slower, according to the different temperature of the water ( <title>Quaest. Nat.</title> 7); and secondly, because the length of the hours varied in the different seasons of the year. To remove the second of these defects the inside of the clepsydra was covered with a coat of wax during the shorter days, and when they became longer the wax was gradually taken away again ( Aen. Tact. c. 22. 10). Plato is said to have used a <foreign lang="greek">νυκτερινὸν ὡρολόγιον</foreign> in the shape of a large clepsydra, which indicated the hours of the night, and seems to have been of a complicated structure. This instance shows that at an early period improvements were made on the old and simple clepsydra. But all these improvements were excelled by the ingenious invention of <ref type="cross" target="crossctesibius">Ctesibius</ref> (q.v.), a celebrated mathematician of Alexandria (about B.C. 135). It is called <foreign lang="greek">ὡρολόγιον ὑδραυλικόν</foreign>, and is described by Vitruvius (ix. 9). Water was made to drop upon wheels which were thereby turned. The regular movement of these wheels was communicated to a small statue, which, gradually rising, pointed with a little stick to the hours marked on a pillar which was attached to the mechanism. It indicated the hours regularly throughout the year, but still required to be often attended to and regulated. This complicated clepsydra seems never to have come into general use, and was probably found only in the houses of very wealthy persons. The sundial or gnomon, and a simpler kind of clepsydra, on the other hand, were much used down to a very late period. The twelve parts of the day were not designated by the name <foreign lang="greek">ὥρα</foreign> until the time of the Alexandrian astronomers, and even then the old and vague divisions, described in the article <ref type="cross" target="crossdies">Dies</ref>, were preferred in the affairs of common life. At the time of the geographer Hipparchus, however (about B.C. 150), it seems to have been very common to reckon by hours.</p>
 <p>There is still existing, though in ruins, a horological building, which is one of the most interesting monuments at Athens. It is the structure <cb /> formerly called the Tower of the Winds, but now known as the Horological Monument of Andronicus Cyrrhestes. It is expressly called <seg lang="la">horologium</seg> by Varro (<title>R. R.</title> iii. 5. 17). This building is fully described by Vitruvius (i. 6. 4), and the following illustration shows its ground-plan. For the elevation see the article <ref type="cross" target="crossandronicus">Andronicus</ref>. <figure id="fig.00848">

</figure></p>
 <p>The structure is octagonal, with its faces to the points of the compass. On the northeast and northwest sides are distyle Corinthian porticos, giving access to the interior; and to the south wall is affixed a sort of turret, forming three-quarters of a circle, to contain the cistern which supplied water to the clepsydra in the interior. On the summit of the building was a bronze figure of a Triton, holding a wand in his hand; and this figure turned on a pivot, so that the wand always pointed above that side of the building which faced the wind then blowing. The directions of the several faces were indicated by figures of the eight winds on the frieze of the entablature. On the plain wall below the entablature of each face, lines are still visible which, with the gnomons that stood out above them, formed a series of sundials. In the centre of the interior of the building was a clepsydra, the remains of which are still visible, and are shown on the plan, where the dark lines represent the channels for the water, which was supplied from the turret on the south, and escaped by the hole in the centre. Three other Athenian horologia are extant, one in the monument of Thrasyllus, another that of Phaedrus in the British Museum (<title>C. I. G.</title> 522), a third in the theatre of Dionysus, besides others from different parts of Greece.</p>
 <p>The first horologium with which the Romans became acquainted was the sundial (<seg lang="la">solarium</seg>, or <seg lang="la">horologium sciothericum</seg>), and was, according to some writers, brought to Rome by Papirius Cursor twelve years before the war with Pyrrhus, and placed before the temple of Quirinus (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.  213" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 213</bibl>). Varro stated that it was brought to Rome from Catina in Sicily, at the time of the First Punic War, by the consul M. Valerius Messala, and erected on a column behind the Rostra. But this solarium, being made for a different latitude, did not show the time at Rome correctly. Ninety-nine years afterwards, the censor Q. Marcius Philippus erected by the side of the old solarium a new one, which was more carefully regulated according to the latitude of Rome. But as sundials, however 
<pb n="849" /><cb /> perfect they might be, were useless when the sky was cloudy, P. Scipio Nasica, in his censorship, B.C. 159, established a public clepsydra, which indicated the hours both of day and night. This clepsydra was in after-times generally called <seg lang="la">solarium</seg> ( <title>De N. D.</title> ii. 34, 87). The word <seg lang="la">hora</seg> for hour was introduced at Rome at the time when the Romans became acquainted with the Greek horologia, and was in this signification well known at the time of Plautus (<bibl default="NO"><title>Pseud.</title> 1307</bibl>). After the time of Scipio Nasica, several horologia, chiefly solaria, seem to have been erected in various public places at Rome. A magnificent horologium was erected by Augustus in the Campus Martius. It was a gnomon in the shape of an obelisk; but Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  73" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 73</bibl>) complains that in the course of time it had become incorrect. Horologia of various descriptions seem also to have been commonly kept by private individuals ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> xvi. 18, 3); and at the time of the emperors, the wealthy Romans used to keep slaves whose special duty it was to announce the hours of the day to their masters ( <bibl n="Juv.  10. 216" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.x. 216</bibl>, with Mayor's note; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 67</bibl>; <bibl n="Petron.  26" default="NO">Petron.26</bibl>).</p>
 <p>From the number of solaria which have been discovered in modern times in Italy (thirteen having been discovered in the neighbourhood of Rome alone), we must infer that they were very generally used among the ancients. The following illustrations represent one of the simplest horologia which have been discovered; it seems to bear great similarity to that the invention of which Vitruvius ascribes to Berosus. It was discovered in 1741, on the hill of Tusculum, and is described by Zuzzeri <bibl default="NO">(Venice, 1746)</bibl>, and by G. H. Martini, in his <title>Abhandlung von den Sonnenuhren der Alten</title>, p. 49 <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1777)</bibl>. <figure id="fig.00849">

 <p>The breadth as well as the height (A O and P A) are somewhat more than eight inches, and the length (A B) a little more than sixteen inches. The surface (A O R B) is horizontal. S P Q T is the basis of the solarium, which, originally, was probably erected upon a pillar. Its side (A S T B) inclines somewhat towards the basis. This inclination was called <foreign lang="greek">ἔγκλιμα</foreign>, or <seg lang="la">inclinatio solarii</seg> and <seg lang="la">enclima succisum</seg> (Vitruv. l. c.), and shows the latitude or polar altitude of the place for which the solarium was made. The angle of the enclima is about 40° 43', which coincides with the latitude of Tusculum. In the body of the solarium is the almost spherical excavation (H K D M I F N), which forms a double hemicyclium. Within this excavation the eleven hour-lines are marked which pass through three semicircles (H L N, K E F, and D M I). The middle one (K E F) represents the equator, the two others the tropic lines of winter and summer. The curve representing the summer tropic is somewhat more than a semicircle, the other two curves somewhat smaller. The ten middle parts or hours in each of the three curves are all equal to one another; but the two extreme ones, though equal to each other, are by one-fourth smaller than the rest. In the middle (G) of the curve (D K H N I I), there is a little square hole, in which the gnomon or pointer must have been fixed, and a trace of it is still visible in the lead by means of which it was fixed. It must have stood in a perpendicular position upon the surface (A B R O), and at a certain distance from the surface it must have turned in a right angle above the spheric excavation, so that its end (C) extended as far as the middle of the equator, as it is restored in the last illustration.</p>
 <p>Clepsydrae were used by the Romans in their camps, chiefly for the purpose of measuring accurately the four watches into which the night was divided ( <title>B. G.</title> v. 13).</p>
 <p>The custom of using clepsydrae as a check upon the speakers in the courts of justice at Rome is said to have been introduced by a law of Cn. Pompeius, in his third consulship ( <title>De Clar. Orat.</title> 38), who adds, before that time the speakers had been under no restrictions, but spoke as long as they deemed proper. But there is some inaccuracy here, as Cicero in B.C. 70 (<title>In Verr.</title> i. 9, 25) speaks of his <seg lang="la">legitimae horae;</seg> in B.C. 63 (<title>Pro Rab. Perd.</title> 2, 6) his defence is limited to half an hour; and in B.C. 59 (<title>Pro Flacc.</title> 33, 82) six hours are allotted. At Rome, as at Athens, the time allowed to the speakers depended upon the importance of the case. Pliny (<title>Epist.</title> ii. 11) states that on one important occasion he spoke for nearly five hours, ten large clepsydrae having been granted to him by the judices, but the case was so important that four others were added. (Cf. Pliny, <title>Epist.</title> vi. 2.) The law of Pompeius only limited the time during which the accuser was allowed to speak to two hours, while the accused was allowed three hours in the case of prosecutions <seg lang="la">de vi.</seg> It is clear from the case of Pliny (<title>Epist.</title> iv. 9) and others that this restriction was not observed on all occasions. An especial officer was at Rome as well as at Athens appointed to stop the clepsydra during the time when documents were read ( <title>Apolog.</title> i. and ii.).

When the members of the Second Triumvirate had imposed a heavy tax upon the Roman matrons and no one of the other sex dared to espouse their cause, Hortensia appeared as their advocate, and made so able a speech that a large portion of the burden was removed (Val.

<head orig="Hortensius">Hortensius</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossquintus">Quintus</ref>. (1) A celebrated orator, who began to distinguish himself by his eloquence in the Roman Forum at the age of nineteen. He was born of a plebeian family, B.C. 114, eight years before Cicero. He served at first as a common soldier, and afterwards as military tribune, in the Social War. In the contest between Marius and Sulla he remained neutral, and was one of the twenty quaestors established by Sulla. He afterwards obtained in succession the offices of aedile, praetor, and consul. As an orator he for a long time shared the reputation of Cicero; but, as his orations are lost, we can only judge of him by the account which his rival gives of his abilities. “Nature had given him,” says Cicero, in his <title>Brutus</title> (88), “so splendid a memory that he never had any need of committing to writing any discourse which he had thought over; while, after his opponent had finished speaking, he could recall, word by word, not only what the other had said, but also the authorities which had been cited against himself. His industry was indefatigable. He never <cb /> let a day pass without speaking in the Forum, or preparing himself to appear on the morrow; oftentimes he did both. He excelled particularly in the art of dividing his subject, and in then reuniting it in a luminous manner, adapting, at the same time, even some of the arguments which had been urged against him. His diction was noble, elegant, and rich; his voice strong and pleasing; his gestures carefully studied.” The eloquence of Hortensius would seem, in fact, to have been of the showy species called Asiatic, which flourished in the Greek colonies of Asia Minor, and was infinitely more florid and ornamental than the oratory of Athens, or even of Rhodes, being full of brilliant thoughts and sparkling expressions. This glowing style of rhetoric, though deficient in <figure id="fig.00850.2">
<head orig="Hortensius. (Villa Albani, Rome.)">Hortensius. (Villa Albani, Rome.)</head>
</figure> solidity and weight, was not unsuitable in a young man; and, being further recommended by a beantiful cadence of periods, met with great applause. But Hortensius, as he advanced in life, did not correct this exuberance; and his somewhat tawdry taste in phraseology, which, even in his earliest years, had occasionally excited ridicule among the senators, being now totally inconsistent with his advanced age and dignity, his reputation in consequence waned. Possibly, too, from his declining health and strength, which greatly failed in his latter years, he may not have been able to give its full effect to that showy rhetoric in which he had indulged. A constant toothache and swelling in the jaws greatly impaired his powers of elocution and utterance, and became at length so severe as to accelerate his end. A few months, however, before his death, which happened in B.C. 50, he pleaded for his nephew Messala, who was accused of illegal canvassing, and acquitted more in consequence of the exertions of his uncle than the justice of his cause. So discreditable, indeed, was the case esteemed 
<pb n="851" /><cb />
 that, though the speech of Hortensius had been much admired, he was received, on entering the theatre on the following day, with loud hisses ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> viii. 2). The speech, however, revived all the admiration of the public for his oratorical talents, and convinced them that, had he possessed the same perseverance as Cicero, he would not have been inferior to that orator.</p>
 <p>It appears from Macrobius that Hortensius was much ridiculed by his contemporaries on account of his affected gestures. In pleading, his hands were constantly in motion, whence he was often attacked by his adversaries in the Forum for resembling an actor; and on one occasion he received from his opponent the appellation of Dionysia, the name of a celebrated dancing-girl (Aul. Gell. i. 5). The actors Aesopus and Roscius frequently attended his pleadings to catch his gestures and imitate them on the stage (Val. Max. viii. 10). Such, indeed, was his exertion in action that it was commonly said that it could not be determined whether people went to hear or to see him. Like Demosthenes, he selected and put on his dress with the most studied care and neatness. He is said not only to have prearranged his gestures, but also to have adjusted the folds of his toga before a mirror when about to go to the Forum. He so arranged his gown that the folds did not fall by chance, but were formed with great care by help of a knot carefully tied and concealed by his robe, which apparently flowed carelessly around him (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 3. 13" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>iii. 13</bibl>). Macrobius also records a story of his instituting an action of damages against a person who had jostled him while walking in this elaborate dress, and had ruffled his toga when he was about to appear in public with his drapery adjusted according to his favourite arrangement.</p>
 <p>Hortensius stood, for thirteen years, at the head of the Roman bar; and being, in consequence, engaged during that long period on one side or other in every case of importance, he soon amassed an enormous fortune. He lived, too, with a magnificence corresponding to his wealth. His house at Rome formed the nucleus of the imperial palace, which was enlarged from the time of Augustus to that of Nero, till it nearly covered the whole Palatine Mount and branched over other hills. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalatium">Palatium</ref>.) Besides his mansion in Rome, he possessed villas at Tusculum, Bauli, and Laurentum, where he was accustomed to give the most elegant and elaborate entertainments. His olive plantations he is said to have regularly moistened with wine; and, on one occasion, during the hearing of an important case in which he was engaged with Cicero, he begged the latter to change with him the previously arranged order of pleading, as he was obliged to go to the country to pour wine on a favourite plane-tree, which grew near his Tusculan villa (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 3. 13" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>iii. 13</bibl>). Notwithstanding this profusion, his heir found no less than 10,000 casks of wine in his cellar after his death (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 14</bibl>). Besides his taste for wine and fondness for plantations, he indulged in a passion for pictures and fish-ponds. At his Tusculan villa he built a hall for the reception of a painting of the expedition of the Argonauts, by the painter Cydias , which cost the sum of 144,000 sesterces. At his country-seat near Bauli, on the sea-shore, he vied with Lucullus and Philippus in the extent of his fish-ponds, which were constructed at an immense cost, and so formed that the tide flowed <cb /> into them (Varr. <title>R. R.</title> iii. 3); yet such was his reluctance to diminish the supply that when he gave entertainments at Bauli he generally sent to the neighbouring town of Puteoli to buy the fish; and Varro declares that a friend could more easily get his chariot-mules out of his stable than a mullet from his ponds. He was more anxious about the welfare of his fish than the health of his slaves, and less solicitous that a sick servant might not take what was unfit for him than that his fish might not drink water which was unwholesome. It is even said (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 9. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>ix. 55</bibl>) that he was so passionately fond of a particular lamprey as to shed tears for its untimely death. At his Laurentan villa, Hortensius had a wooded park of fifty acres encompassed with a wall. This enclosure he called a nursery of wild beasts, all of which came for their food at a certain hour on the blowing of a horn. See Forsyth, <bibl default="NO"><title>Hortensius</title> (London, 1879)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of the preceding, called also <ref type="cross" target="crosshortalus">Hortălus</ref>, a dissipated person who fought on Caesar's side in the Civil War. In B.C. 44, after Caesar's death, he joined Brutus and put to death C. Antonius, brother of the triumvir. After the battle of Philippi, Hortalus was himself taken and slain.

<head orig="Hortus">Hortus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κῆπος</foreign>). A garden. Gardens among the ancients were usually of a strictly utilitarian character. Even the mythical garden of Alcinoüs, described in the <title>Odyssey</title> (vii. 112-130), is divided into a fruit-garden, a vineyard, and a kitchengarden, with no mention of flowers; and when, in later times, flower-gardens are spoken of (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">κήπους εὐώδεις</foreign>, <bibl default="NO"><title>Aves</title>, 1066</bibl>), they are probably gardens in which flowers were cultivated for profit. The ancients, in fact, had much less love of landscape beauties than the moderns, and some of their garden arrangements seem shocking to modern taste. Longus (<title>Pastoralia</title>, ii. 3) describes a garden in which flowers were mingled with fruits; and Plutarch says that the beauty of roses and violets is enhanced by planting them side by side with onions and leeks! The suburbs of Athens abounded in market-gardens, which supplied the city with both flowers and vegetables (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 18</bibl>). Plato speaks of books on gardening ( <title>Min.</title>p. 316 E).</p>
 <p>Roman gardens are described in two letters of the Younger Pliny (ii. 17; v. 6), from which it appears that they were rather prim and formal in their plan, with regular walks (<seg lang="la">ambulationes</seg>) lined by closely-clipped hedges of box, yew, and cypress; and diversified with statues, pyramids, and summer-houses (<seg lang="la">diaetae</seg>). As in modern Italy and in France under Louis XV., so at Rome the trees and shrubs were often cut into figures of animals, ships, letters, and grotesque forms (<seg lang="la">ars topiaria</seg>), so that the regular name for an ornamental gardener is <seg lang="la">topiarius.</seg> (Cf. Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 16. 140" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xvi. 140</bibl>; xxi. 68; xxii. 76.) The principal flowers known to the ancients were the rose, violet, crocus, narcissus, lily, iris, poppy, amaranth, and gladiolus.</p>
 <p>Conservatories with windows closed by <seg lang="la">specularia</seg> (windows of talc) are mentioned by the writers of the first century A.D.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὧρος</foreign>, Egyptian <title>Har</title>). An Egyptian god, the son of Osiris and Isis. At the death of his father he was still a child, but when he had grown to be a stalwart youth (Harver—i. e. “stronger Horus”), he overcame and captured Typhon, the murderer of his father, after a combat lasting over many days, and handed him over to Isis, who, however, let him go free. By the Egyptians he was deemed the victorious god of light, who overcame darkness, winter, and drought, and was identified with Apollo by the Greeks. He is often represented with the head of a sparrowhawk, which was sacred to him. He must be distinguished from a younger Horus, the Harpocrates of the Greeks (in Egyptian Harpechruti—i. e. “Har, the Child”), who was received by Isis from Osiris in the under-world, and is the representative of the winter-sun, and also the image of early vegetation, and therefore identified with <ref type="cross" target="crosspriapus">Priapus</ref> (q.v.). Statues represent him as a naked boy with his finger on his mouth. Misunderstanding this symbol of childhood, the Greeks made him the god of Silence and Secrecy. Afterwards, in the time when mysteries were in vogue, his worship was widely extended among the Greeks, and also among the Romans.

 <p> (1) An inn. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaupona">Caupona</ref>.</p>
 <p>(2) (<foreign lang="greek">ξενία, προξενία</foreign>). Hospitality was one of the characteristic features of almost all nations in the primitive period. In civilized countries the necessity of general hospitality is not so much felt; but at a time when the State or the laws of nations afforded scarcely any security, and when the traveller on his journey did not meet with any places destined for his reception and accommodation, the exercise of hospitality was absolutely necessary. Among the nations of antiquity, with whom the right of hospitality was sanctified by religion, it was to some degree observed to the latest period of their existence, and acquired a political importance which it has never had in any other age. It was in Greece, as well as at Rome, of a twofold nature, either private or public, in as far as it was either established between individuals (<seg lang="la">hospitium privatum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ξενία</foreign>) or between two States (<seg lang="la">hospitium publicum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">προξενία</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The stranger who appeared with no hostile object was regarded in the light of a suppliant and under the especial protection of Zeus Xenios. Hence he was kindly received, and on his departure broke a die (<foreign lang="greek">ἀστράγαλος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">tessera</seg>) with the host, each keeping a half for mutual recognition by themselves or by their descendants in future times. The ties of hospitality thus formed were hereditary in families. At Rome a stranger (<seg lang="la">hospes</seg>) was equally protected by custom and law, and the <seg lang="la">tessera hospitalis</seg> was equally a pledge and a symbol of this relation of host and guest. A formal hospitality when once declared could only be broken off in an equally formal way by a solemn <seg lang="la">renuntiatio.</seg> Public, as opposed to private, hospitality was a like relation between nations and cities, who were bound to show especial kindness to each other's citizens.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Οὖννοι, Χοῦνοι</foreign>). An Asiatic people who dwelt for some centuries in the plains of Tartary, and were formidable to the Chinese Empire long before they were known to the Romans. It was against them, in fact, that the famous Chinese wall was built. A portion of the nation crossed into Europe, and were allowed by Valens to settle in Thrace, A.D. 376. Under their king, Attila (A.D. 434-453), they devastated the fairest portions of the Empire; but a few years after Attila's death their power was completely destroyed by the Turks.</p>
 <p>The Huns were probably remotely descended from the Hiung-nu, a race of Turkish (“Turanian”) stock, <cb /> though fable declared them to be the offspring of the Scythian witches and the unclean and infernal spirits with whom these witches consorted in the desert. They are described as being dark, stunted, and uncouth, with shrill voices. Like the Mongolians, they were a race of horseman, fighting with bone-tipped javelins and with slings and lassoes. They ate meat nearly raw, and herbs; and wore the hides of wild beasts.

A festival, celebrated for three days in the summer of each year, at <ref type="cross" target="crossamyclae">Amyclae, in honour of Apollo and his unhappy favourite Hyacynthus</ref> (q.v.). Müller gives strong reasons for supposing that the Hyacinthia was originally a festival of Demeter. Like other festivals in honour of nature, the festival of the Hyacinthia, celebrated by the Spartans at Amyclae for three days in July, down to the time of the Roman emperors, was connected with the expression of grief at the death of vegetation, of joy over the harvest, and of cheerful trust in the re-awakening of nature. On the first day, which was dedicated to silent mourning, sacrifice to the dead was offered at the grave of Hyacinthus, which was under the statue of Apollo in the temple at Amyclae. The following day was spent in public rejoicing in honour of Apollo, in which all the populace, including the slaves, took part. They went in festal procession with choruses of singing boys and girls, accompanied by harps and flutes, to the temple of Apollo, where games and competitions, sacrifices and entertainments to one another took place, and a robe, woven by the Spartan women, was offered to the god.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑάκινθος</foreign>). (1) Son of King Amyclas, of Amyclae in Laconia, and of Diomedes. He was beloved for his beauty by Apollo and Zephyrus. As Apollo was one day teaching the boy how to play at quoits, on the banks of the river Eurotas, the wind-god in his jealousy drove the quoit with such violence against the head of Hyacinthus that the blow killed him. From his blood Apollo caused a flower of the same name to spring up, with the exclamation of woe, AI, AI, marked upon its petals. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaiax">Aiax</ref>.) Hyacinthus, like Adonis, is a personification of vegetation, which flourishes in the spring-time, but is scorched and killed by the glowing heat of the summer sun, which is symbolized by the quoit or discus.</p>

<div2 id="crosshyades" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hyădes">Hyades</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑάδες</foreign>). According to some, the daughters of Atlas and sisters of the Pleiades. The best accounts, however, make them to have been the nymphs of Dodona, to whom Zeus confided the nurture of Bacchus. Pherecydes gives their names as Ambrosia, Coronis, Eudora, Dioné, Aesula, and Polyxo. Hesiod, on the other hand, calls them Phaesula, Coronis, Cleea, Phaeo, and Eudora. The names generally given to the seven stars are Ambrosia, Eudora, Pedilé, Coronis, Polyxo, Phyto, and Dioné or Thyené. The Hyades went about with 
<pb n="853" /><cb />
 their divine charge, communicating his discovery to mankind, until, being chased with him into the sea by Lycurgus, Zeus, in compassion, raised them to the skies and transformed them into stars. According to the more common legend, however, the Hyades, having lost their brother Hyas, who was killed by a bear or lion, or, as Timaeus says, by an asp, were so disconsolate at his death that they pined away and died; and after death they were changed into stars ( <bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 192" default="NO" valid="yes">Hyg. <title>Fab.</title>192</bibl>). The stars called Hyades (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑάδες</foreign>) derived their name from <foreign lang="greek">ὕειν</foreign>, “to make wet,” “to rain,” because their setting, at both the evening and morning twilight, was for the Greeks and Romans a sure presage of wet and stormy weather, these two periods falling respectively in the latter half of April and November. Horace, with a double allusion to both fable and physical phenomena, calls the stars in question <title>tristes Hyadas </title>( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>i. 3</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 14</bibl>). The Roman writers sometimes call these stars by the name of Suculae, “little pigs,” for which epithet Pliny assigns a singular derivation. According to this writer, the Roman farmers mistook the etymology of the Greek name Hyades, and deduced it, not from <foreign lang="greek">ὕειν</foreign>, “to rain,” but from <foreign lang="greek">ὗς</foreign>, “a sow” (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 26</bibl>). It is more probable, however, that Suculae was the oldest Roman name, given before the Greek appellation was known, and to be compared with our popular astronomical terms such as “the Dipper,” “Charles's Wain,” etc. Isidorus derives the term Suculae from <hi rend="italic">succus</hi>, in the sense of “moisture” or “wet” (<seg lang="la">a succo et pluviis</seg>, Isidor. <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 3. 70" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>iii. 70</bibl>), an etymology which has found its way into many later works. Some grammarians, again, sought to derive the name Hyades from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Υ</foreign> (upsilon), in consequence of the resemblance which the cluster of stars bears to that letter.</p>
 <p>The Hyades, in the celestial sphere, are at the head of the Bull (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τοῦ βουκράνου</foreign>).

<head orig="Hydraulus">Hydraulus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὕδραυλος</foreign>). A water-organ. According to Athenaeus, it was the invention of Ctesibius of <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandria">Alexandria</ref> (q.v.), who evidently took the idea of his organ from the syrinx or Pandean pipes, a musical instrument of the highest antiquity among the Greeks. His object being to employ a row of pipes of great size, and capable of emitting the most powerful as well as the softest sounds, he contrived the means of adapting keys with levers (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγκωνίσκοι</foreign>), and with perforated sliders (<foreign lang="greek">πώματα</foreign>) to open and shut the mouths of the pipes (<foreign lang="greek">γλωσσόκομα</foreign>), a supply of wind being obtained, without intermission, by bellows, in which the pressure of water performed the same part which is fulfilled in the modern organ by a weight (Hero , <title>Spirit.</title> 228). On this account the instrument invented by Ctesibius was called the water-organ (<foreign lang="greek">ὕδραυλις, ὑδραυλικὸν ὄργανον</foreign>, Heron, <title>Spirit.; hydraulica machina</title>, Vitruv. x. 13; <seg lang="la">hydraulus</seg>, Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

It is described in an epigram by the emperor Julian (Brunck, <bibl n="Ptol. Anal. 2. 403" default="NO"> <title>Anal.</title>ii. 403</bibl>=<title>Anth. Pal.</title> ix. 365), who mentions the swift fingers of the performer, but not the water-bellows; and more clearly in the lines of Claudian (<title>De Manl. Theod. Cons.</title> 316-319). We have here the keys, the innumerable pipes of metal, the lever as large as a beam which sets the water in motion. Its pipes were partly of bronze (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκειὴ ἄρουρα</foreign>, Julian ; <seg lang="la">seges aëna</seg>, Claudian), and partly of reed (<foreign lang="greek">δόνακες</foreign>, Julian ). The number of its stops, and consequently of its 
<pb n="854" /><cb />
 rows of pipes, varied from one to eight, so that Tertullian (<title>De Anima</title>, 14) describes it with reason as an exceedingly complicated instrument. We are still in the dark as to the exact part played by the water, which, besides, must have rendered the instrument much less portable. As invented by Ctesibius, the organ was doubtless hydraulic: but the epigram of Julian omits all mention of the water, and probably, in later times, the mechanism was simplified and the bellows blown directly by the pedal, as in the modern harmonium.</p>
 <p>The organ was well adapted to gratify the Roman people in the splendid entertainments provided for them by the emperors and other opulent persons. Nero was very curious about organs, both in regard to their musical effect and their <figure id="fig.00854">

A contorniate coin of this emperor in the British Museum (see illustration) shows a small organ with a sprig of laurel on one side and a man standing on the other. The general form of the organ is also clearly exhibited in a poem by Publilius Porphyrius Optatianus, describing the instrument, and composed of verses so constructed as to show both the lower part which contained the bellows, the wind-chest which lay upon it, and over this the row of twenty-six pipes. These are represented by twenty-six lines, which increase in length each by one letter, until the last line is twice as long as the first (Wernsdorf, <title>Poetae Lat.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὕλας</foreign>). Son of Theodamas, king of the Dryopes, and the nymph Menodicé. He was a favourite of Heracles, whom he accompanied on the Argonautic expedition. When Heracles disembarked upon the coast of Mysia to cut himself a fresh oar, Hylas followed him to draw water from a fountain, whose nymphs drew the youth down into the water. The Argonauts having gone on their way, Heracles, with his sister's son Polyphemus, 
<pb n="855" /><cb /> remained behind to search for him. On failing to find him, he did not leave until he had taken hostages from the Mysians, and made them promise that they would produce the boy either dead or alive. After that, the inhabitants of Cios (founded by Polyphemus and afterwards called Prusias) continually sought for Hylas, and sacrificed to him every year at the fountain, thrice calling him by name. The story of Hylas suggested a song of Thomas Moore's, and is the subject of a poem, <title>Hylas</title>, by Bayard Taylor. See Calverly's translation of the thirteenth idyl of Theocritus.

<head orig="Hyllus">Hyllus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὕλλος</foreign>). The son of Heracles and Deïanira, and husband of Iolé. When he and the rest of the children of Heracles, at their father's death, were pursued everywhere by the enmity of Eurystheus, they at last found succour from Theseus, or his son Demophon. When Eurystheus drew near with his army to compel the Athenians to give them up, Macaria, daughter of Heracles, freely offered herself up as a sacrifice for her brethren, who, aided by the Athenians, defeated the enemy, Eurystheus being slain as a fugitive by Hyllus himself. Having withdrawn from Attica to Thessaly, Hyllus was adopted by the Dorian prince Aegimius, whom Heracles had once assisted in the war between the Lapithae and the Dryopes, under promise of his abdication of the royal power, together with a third part of the kingdom. Thus the rule over the Dorians passed to him and his descendants. When commanded by the Delphic oracle to attempt to conquer the kingdom of Eurystheus immediately after “the third fruit,” he endeavoured after the lapse of three years to invade the Peloponnesus by way of the Isthmus. He was, however, repulsed by Atreus, the successor of Eurystheus, and fell in single combat with Echemus, king of Tegea. It was in the “third generation” after him that the sons of his grandson Aristomachus—viz. Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus—at last conquered the Peloponnesus, which was then under the rule of Tisamenus, son of Orestes. See <ref type="cross" target="crossheraclidae">Heraclidae</ref>.

<head orig="Hymenaeus">Hymenaeus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑμέναιος</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Hymen</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑμήν</foreign>). The Greek god of marriage and of the marriage-song named after him. He is sometimes described as the son of Apollo and a Muse (either Terpsichoré, Urania, or Calliopé), who had vanished on his own wedding-day, and was consequently always sought for at every wedding. He is also described as a son of the Thessalian Magnes and of the Muse Calliopé, and as beloved by Apollo and Thamyris; or as the son of Dionysus and Aphrodité, who lost his voice and life while singing the nuptial song at the marriage of Dionysus and Ariadné. According to Attic tradition, he was an Argive youth who, in the disguise of a girl, followed to the feast of Demeter at Eleusis a young Athenian maiden whom he loved without winning the consent of her parents. <cb /> Hymenaeus and some of the maidens who were celebrating the festival, were carried off by pirates, whom he afterwards killed in their sleep, and henceforth became the champion of all women and damsels. In art he is represented like Eros, as a beautiful, winged youth, only with a more serious expression, and carrying in his hand the marriage torch and nuptial veil. The marriagesong called <title>Hymenaeus</title>, which is mentioned as early as Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 493" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 493</bibl>), was sung by young men and maidens, to the sound of flutes, during the festal procession of the bride from the house of her parents to that of the bridegroom.

See <ref type="cross" target="crossmusica">Musica</ref>.</p>
 <p>In Latin, examples of hymns in the older sense are the songs of the Salii (<title>carmina Saliaria</title>), sung by the priests of Mars (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssalii">Salii</ref>); the hymn of the Arval Brethren (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>); the hymns composed by Horace (<seg lang="la">carmen saeculare</seg>) for the Ludi Saeculares in B.C. 17, and sung in honour of Diana and Apollo (see <ref type="cross" target="crossludi">Ludi Saeculares</ref>); and some of later date, like the poem called <title>Laus Herculis</title>, in 137 hexameters, by an anonymous author (see Bährens in the <title>Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie</title>, etc., 105, 52. 503); the <title>Hymnus Claudii ad Lunam </title> (<title>Poet. Lat. Min.</title>, ed. Bährens, iii. 163); and the parodic hymn to Pan (id. iii. 170).</p>
 <p>The early Christian hymns in Greek and Latin are interesting. Of those in Greek, only a comparatively few are written in the classic metres— e. g. those by Clemens Alexandrinus (about A.D. 220), Englished by Dr. Dexter in his “Shepherd of Early Youth;” Gregory of Nanzianzus (A.D. 360), Synesius (A.D. 400), and Sophronius (A.D. 629). Others, and especially those used by the Eastern Church, are strongly Oriental in style, due to the constant study of the Jewish Psalter. No authors of Latin hymns are mentioned earlier than A.D. 325, the date of the Council of Nice. Soon after, however, two great hymnologists—St. Hilary and St. Ambrose—appear, both in the fourth century, followed by Prudentius (A.D. 350-410), whose poems in 1860 reached a sixty-third edition; Sedulius of the same period; Venantius Fortunatus (A.D. 530- 609), and Gregory the Great (A.D. 540-604). Some of the most magnificent of the Latin hymns are of unknown authorship. Such are the famous <title>Veni, Creator Spiritus</title>, popularly ascribed to Charlemagne, but really of earlier date; the hymn beginning 
<pb n="856" /><cb /> <title>Verbum Dei, Deo Natum;</title> and, above all, the sublime <title>Dies Irae</title>, the despair of translators, which is often attributed to Thomas of Celano, but on no sure authority (Mohnike, <title>Hymnologische Forschungen</title>, i. pp. 1-24).</p>
 <p>The Latin hymns are interesting from a linguistic and metrical standpoint, as usually reverting to the older and more natural accentual system of prosody instead of preserving the artificial and unpopular distinctions of syllabic quantity. Among the common people, in their folk-songs (e. g. the songs of the soldiers in their barracks and during the triumphs, the chants, spells, and nursery songs), the accentual system still survived, and, as in the <title>Instructiones</title> of Commodianus, written in the third century A.D., the popular system sometimes made its way even into written literature. It was natural that the Christian hymns, being composed not for the learned and fastidious, but for the common people—for provincials and non-Romans—should avail themselves of the far freer range allowed by the loose laws of accent. Thus St. Augustine, even in the title of one of his psalms (<title>Psalmus contra Partem Donati</title>), shows his desire to escape from the rigid restrictions of the Augustan prosody—in other words, to write a <seg lang="la">canticum</seg> and not a <seg lang="la">carmen.</seg> In the later hymns, many metrical ingenuities are introduced, such as the so-called leonine and other rhymes (see <ref type="cross" target="crossleonini-versus">Leonini Versus</ref>), of which a good account will be found in the introduction and notes to Archbishop Trench's <bibl default="NO"><title>Sacred Latin Poetry</title> (London, 1874)</bibl>.</p>

<div2 id="crosshypatia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Hypatia">Hypatia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑπατία</foreign>). A mathematician of Alexandria, daughter of Theon , and still more celebrated than her father. She was born about the end of the fourth century. In her studies she applied herself in particular to the philosophy of Plato. Following the example of her master, she resolved to add to her information by travelling; and, having reached Athens, attended there the lectures of the ablest instructors. On her return to her native city, she was invited by the magistrates to give lectures in philosophy, and Alexandria beheld a woman succeed to that long line of illustrious teachers which had rendered its school one of the most celebrated in the world. She was an Eclectic; but the exact sciences formed the basis of all her instruction, and she applied their demonstrations to the principles of the speculative sciences. She numbered among her disciples many celebrated men, among others Synesius, afterwards bishop of Ptolemaïs, who preserved during his whole life the most friendly feelings towards her, although she constantly refused to become a convert to Christianity. Hypatia united to a masculine intellect many of the attractions and all the virtues of her sex. Her dress was remarkable for its simplicity; her conduct was always above suspicion; and she knew well how to compel the respect of those of her auditors who felt the influence of her charms. All idea of marriage was constantly rejected by her as threatening to interfere with her devotion to her favourite studies. Orestes, governor of Alexandria, admired the talents of Hypatia, and frequently had recourse to her for advice. He was desirous of repressing the too ardent zeal of St. Cyril, who saw in Hypatia one of the principal supports of paganism. The partisans of the bishop, on their side, beheld in the measures of the governor the result of the counsels of Hypatia; the most fanatical of their number, in March, A.D. 415, seized upon Hypatia as she was proceeding to her school, forced her to descend from her chariot, and dragged her into a neighbouring church, where, stripped of her vestments, she was put to death by her brutal foes. Her body was hacked to pieces with oyster-shells, and the bloody remains were dragged through the streets and finally burned.</p>
 <p>The works of Hypatia were lost in the burning of the Alexandrian Library. In the number of these were a commentary on Diophantus, an Astronomical 
<pb n="857" /><cb />
 Canon, and a commentary on the Conics of Apollonius of Perga. The very names of her other productions are lost. The Greek Anthology contains an epigram in praise of Hypatia, attributed to Paulus Silentiarius. Canon Kingsley's historical romance <bibl default="NO">(London, 1853)</bibl> has done much to make her name familiar to English readers.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑπερβόρεοι</foreign>, lit. “dwellers beyond the north wind”). A people of Greek legend, whose existence was denied by some of the ancients, while others endeavoured to define their position more precisely. They were said to dwell far in the North, where the sun rose and set only once a year—a fancy due, perhaps, to some dim report of the long arctic summer day. The fruits of the earth ripened quickly with them; they lived in unbroken happiness, knowing no violence or strife, and reached the age of a thousand years; any who were weary of life casting themselves from a sacred rock into the sea. The myth is connected with the worship of the god of light, Apollo, who during the dark winter was supposed to visit them, as his priestly people, in a chariot drawn by swans; returning to Delphi for the summer. There was a tradition in Delos that in earlier times they used to send to that island the first-fruits of their harvests by way of Dodona, Thessaly, and Euboea.

<head orig="Hyperīdes">Hyperides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑπερείδης</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ὑπερίδης</foreign>). One of the Ten Attic Orators, born about B.C. 390, son of the Athenian Glaucippus. He was a pupil of Plato and Isocrates, and won for himself an important position as a forensic and political orator, although his private life was not unblemished. As a statesman, he decidedly shared the views of Demosthenes, and was his steadfast ally in the struggle against the Macedonian party. It is true that he afterwards (B.C. 324) took part in the prosecution of Demosthenes, when accused of having taken bribes from Alexander's treasurer, Harpalus, and that he contributed to his condemnation on that charge. After the destruction of Thebes by Alexander (335) <cb /> it was only with difficulty that he and Demosthenes escaped being given up to the Macedonians. After the death of Alexander (323) he was the chief instigator of the Lamian War, at the unfortunate conclusion of which he and Demosthenes (who had been reconciled to one another in the meantime) and other patriots were condemned to death by the Macedonian party. He fled for sanctuary to a temple in Aegina, but was dragged away from it by force, and by order of Antipater put to death at Corinth in 322.</p>
 <p>Of the seventy-seven speeches which were known to antiquity as the work of Hyperides, only a few fragments were known until recent times; but in 1847, in a tomb at Thebes, in Egypt, extensive fragments were found of his speech against Demosthenes, together with a speech for Lycophron, and the whole of his oration for Euxenippus. In 1856 there was a further discovery in Egypt of an important part of the funeral oration delivered in 322 over those who had fallen in the siege of Lamia. In 1889 M. Eugène Revillout announced the purchase by the Louvre of a papyrus containing portions of the first oration of Hyperides against Athenogenes (<title>Revue des Études Grecques</title>, Jan.-March, 1889).</p>
 <p>Though the speeches of Hyperides never attain to the force and depth of those of Demosthenes, nevertheless they were valued highly on account of the skill of their construction and the grace and charm of their expression. They are the productions of a practical pleader who is thoroughly in command of all his powers, and who is, above all, an accomplished man of the world—slightly indolent, witty, refined, with a delicious fund of irony, of perfect taste, entertaining and urbane. He is, oratorically speaking, to Demosthenes what Lord Salisbury is to Mr. Gladstone.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑψιπύλη</foreign>). Daughter of Thoas of Lemnos. The Lemnian women had, from jealousy of their Thracian maids, killed all the men of the island; Hypsipylé alone spared her father Thoas, having been the means of aiding his flight. When the Argonauts landed at Lemnos and united with the women, Hypsipylé bore twin sons to Iason— Euneus, who in Homer figures as king of Lemnos and carries on trade with the Greeks before Troy; and Thoas (also called Deïphilus and Nebrophonus), who is sometimes described as a son of Dionysus. When the news of her father's escape was rumoured among the Lemnian women, Hypsipylé was forced to flee for her life, and was captured by pirates, who sold her to Lycurgus of Nemea. There, as the nurse of Opheltes, the infant son of the king, she accidentally caused his death by a snake (see <ref type="cross" target="crossseven-against-thebes">Seven Against Thebes</ref>), and was exposed to the greatest danger, from which she was only rescued by the intervention of her sons, who were sent to her aid by Dionysus.

<head orig="Hyrieus">Hyrieus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑριεύς</foreign>). (1) An Arcadian monarch, for whom Agamedes and Trophonius constructed a treasury. The story about this treasury resembles the one told by Herodotus (ii. 121) of the treasury of the Egyptian king Rhampsinitus. In the construction of the treasury of Hyrieus, Agamedes and Trophonius contrived to place one stone in such a manner that it could be taken away outside, and thus formed an entrance to the treasury, without any one perceiving it. Agamedes and Trophonius now constantly robbed the treasury; and the king, seeing that locks and seals were uninjured while his treasures were constantly decreasing, set traps to catch the thief. Agamedes was thus ensnared, and Trophonius cut off his head to avert the discovery. After this Trophonius was immediately swallowed up by the earth. On this spot there was afterwards, in the grove of Lebadea, the cave of Agamedes with a column by the side of it. Here, also, was the oracle of Trophonius. A tradition mentioned by Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 1. 47" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tusc.</title>i. 47</bibl>) states that Agamedes and Trophonius, after building the temple of Apollo at Delphi, prayed to the god to grant them in reward for their labour what was best for men. The god promised to do so on a certain day, and when the day came, the two brothers died.</p>

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
