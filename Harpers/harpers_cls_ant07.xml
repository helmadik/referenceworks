 <p>A tribune of the plebs in B.C. 66, when he carried a law conferring upon Pompey the command of the war against the pirates; and consul in 58, when he took part in the banishment of Cicero. In the year 57 he went to Syria as proconsul, and restored Ptolemy Auletes to the throne of Egypt, in opposition to a decree of the Senate. On his return to Rome in 54 he was accused both of <seg lang="la">maiestas</seg> and the <seg lang="la">crimen repetundarum</seg>, for the illegal receipt of 10,000 talents from Ptolemy, and was defended by Cicero. He was condemned on the latter charge, and went into exile. In the civil war he fought on the side of Caesar. He died about B.C. 47.

 <p> (Semitic <hi rend="italic">gadir</hi>, “a hedge,” “stockade”; <foreign lang="greek">τὰ Γάδειρα</foreign>). The modern Cadiz; a very ancient town in Hispania Baetica, founded by the Phoenicians, and one of the chief seats of their commerce in the west of Europe, situated on a small island of the same name (Isla de Leon), separated from the mainland by a narrow channel. Herodotus says (iv. 8) that the island of Erythia was close to Gadeira; whence most later writers supposed the island of Gades to be the same as the mythical island of Erythia, from which Hercules carried off the oxen of Geryon. Its inhabitants received the Roman franchise from Iulius Caesar, and Strabo mentions as a striking proof of its wealth and importance that, in the census taken under Augustus, Gades was the residence of some 500 equites— a number greater than in any town of Italy except Patavium (Padua). Gades was allied with Rome in the Second Punic War (<bibl n="Liv.  32. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxii. 2</bibl>). The city was rich, luxurious, and immoral. Its dancing girls with their lascivious dances are often spoken of in Roman literature. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssaltatio">Saltatio</ref>.

<head orig="Gaea">Gaea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γαῖα</foreign>). The Greek goddess of the earth. According to Hesiod she came into being after Chaos, and brought forth of herself the Sky (<foreign lang="greek">Οὐρανός</foreign>), the mountains, and the Sea (<foreign lang="greek">Πόντος</foreign>). By Uranus she was mother of the Titans, Cyclopes, and Hecatoncheires. From the blood of her mutilated husband sprang the Erinyes, Giants, and Melian nymphs; to Pontus she bore Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. Other terrible beings, such as the giants Typhon, Antaeus, and Tityus, were her offspring, as also the <seg lang="la">autochthones</seg> or aborigines, such as Erechtheus and Cecrops. In Homer she is invoked with Zeus, the Sun, Heaven, and Hell as a witness to oaths, and was <cb /> worshipped with the sacrifice of a black lamb; but she was especially honoured as the mother of all, who nourishes her creatures and pours rich blessings upon them. In Athens, in particular, she was worshipped as <foreign lang="greek">κουροτρόφος</foreign>, or the nourisher of children, and at the same time as the goddess of death, who summons all her creatures back to her and hides them in her bosom. She was honoured also as the primeval prophetess, especially in Delphi, the oracle of which was at first in her possession as the power who sent forth the vapours which inspired the seer. The corresponding Roman goddess was <ref type="cross" target="crosstellus">Tellus</ref> (q.v.).

The pure Gaetuli were not an Aethiopic (i. e. Negro), but a Libyan race, and were most probably the ancestors of the Berbers (Ritter, <title>Erdkunde</title>, i. pp. 1034 foll.). Cossus Lentulus brought the Gaetulians under Roman rule, receiving for this a triumph and the surname Gaetulicus.

 <p>A distinguished classical scholar, born at Ilford, England, in 1779. He studied at Christ Church College, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1804. After publishing an elaborate edition of the <title>Enchiridion</title> of Hephaestion, he was made Public Examiner <bibl default="NO">(1810)</bibl>, and in 1811 Regius Professor of Greek. From 1819 to 1847 he was rector of the parish of Westwell, and from 1831 was Dean of Christ Church. He died in 1855.

<head orig="Gaius, Gaia">Gaius, Gaia</head>

 <p>(1) A praenomen very common at Rome to both sexes. (On the name see F. D. Allen in <title>Harvard Studies in Class. Philology</title>, iii. pp. 71-87 [1891]). C (the old form of G), in its 
<pb n="703" /><cb /> natural position, denoted the name of the male, and when reversed, that of the female; thus, C was equivalent to Gaius ; but C to Gaia. Female praenomina, which were marked with an inverted capital, were, however, early disused among the Romans. The custom after this was, in case there was only one daughter, to name her after the <seg lang="la">gens.</seg> If there were two, to distinguish them by <seg lang="la">maior</seg> and <seg lang="la">minor</seg> added to their names; if there were more than two, they were distinguished by their number, Prima, Secunda, etc. Thus we have, in the first case, Tullia, the daughter of Cicero; Iulia, the daughter of Caesar; and in the second, Cornelia Maior, Cornelia Minor, etc. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnomen">Nomen</ref>.) Gaius and Gaia are the typical names of husband and wife in Roman usage; and at weddings the bridegroom and bride were called respectively Gaius and Gaia (cf. Festus, s. v. <title>Gaia;</title> and the marriage formula pronounced by the bride, <title>Ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia</title>).</p>
 <p> (2) One of the most accomplished professors of Roman law and writers on that subject. He was a native of the Asiatic provinces, and spent his days in Rome under Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius (about A.D. 110-180). His writings were numerous; but we possess in a tolerably complete form nothing but his <title>Institutiones</title>, or introduction to the private law of the Romans. This was discovered by Niebuhr in 1816 on a palimpsest of the fifth century at Verona, having before been known in quotations only. The work is in four books, the first of which treats of the family, the second and third of property, and the fourth of legal procedure. Popular and intelligible without being superficial, it was a favourite hand-book of law, and served as a foundation for the <title>Institutiones</title> of Justinian. As a jurist Gaius belongs to the conservative school of the Sabiniani. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossateius-capito">Ateius Capito</ref>.) The first edition of Gaius was that of Göschen and Hollweg <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1820)</bibl>, the third edition being revised by Lachmann <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1842)</bibl>. The best text is now that of Huschke in the Tenbner series; while translations into English with commentaries have been made by Abdy and Walker <bibl default="NO">(Cambridge, 1870)</bibl>, E. Poste <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1875)</bibl>, Muirhead <bibl default="NO">(Edinburgh, 1880)</bibl>, and Mears <bibl default="NO">(London, 1882)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γαλατία</foreign>). A country of Asia Minor, composed of parts of Phrygia and Cappadocia, and bounded on the west, south, and southeast by those countries, and on the northeast, north, and northwest by Pontus, Paphlagonia, and Bithynia. It derived its name from its inhabitants, who were Gauls that had invaded and settled in Asia Minor at various periods during the third century B.C. They speedily overran all Asia Minor within the Taurus, and exacted tribute from its various princes; but Attalus I. gained a complete victory over them (B.C. 230), and compelled them to settle down within the limits of the country thenceforth called Galatia, and also, on account of the mixture of Greeks with the Celtic inhabitants which speedily took place, GraecoGalatia and Gallograecia. The people of Galatia adopted to a great extent Greek habits and manners and religious observances, but preserved their own language, so that even in the fourth century A.D. Jerome says that the speech of the Galatians resembles the local dialect of the Treviri in Gaul. They retained also their political divisions and forms of government. They consisted of three great tribes — the Tolistobogi, the Trocmi, and the Tectosages—each subdivided into four parts, <figure id="fig.00703.2">
<head orig="Coin of Galatia, with the head of Roman emperor.">Coin of Galatia, with the head of Roman emperor.</head>

At length one of the tetrarchs, Deiotarus, was rewarded for his services to the Romans in the Mithridatic war by the title of king, together with a grant of Pontus and Armenia Minor; and after the death of his successor, 
<pb n="704" /><cb /> Amyntas, Galatia was made by Augustus a Roman province (B.C. 25). Its only important cities were: in the southwest, Pessinus, the capital of the Tolistobogi; in the centre, Ancyra, the capital of the Tectosages; and in the northeast, Tavium, the capital of the Trocmi. From the Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians, we learn that the Christian churches in Galatia consisted in great part of Jewish converts. See Thierry, <title>Hist. des Gaulois.</title>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crosssergius">Sergius</ref>, an orator anterior to Cicero. While holding the government of Spain, he treacherously murdered 30,000 Lusitanians. Having been accused for this by Cato the Censor, he was about to be condemned, when he wrought upon the feelings of the people by embracing before them his two sons, still quite young, an act which saved him ( <bibl n="Cic.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gaius Sulpicius</hi>, a Roman lawyer, father of the emperor. He was consul in A.D. 22.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Servius Sulpicius</hi>, born in the reign of Augustus, of a patrician family. He served with distinction in Germany, and was afterwards proconsul, first in Africa, and subsequently in Hispania Tarraconensis, in which office he gained a reputation for justice and moderation. He was still in Spain when Iulius Vindex, the proconsul of Upper Gaul, rose against Nero. Galba joined Vindex, and Otho, governor of Lusitania, followed his example. The assembled multitudes saluted Galba as emperor and Augustus; but he declared that he was acting only as the lieutenant of the Senate and people of Rome, in order to put an end to the disgraceful tyranny of Nero. The Praetorian Guards soon after, having revolted against Nero, proclaimed Galba, and the Senate acknowledged him as emperor. Galba hastened from Spain to Rome, where he began by calling to account those favourites of Nero who had enriched themselves by proscriptions and confiscations and by the extraordinary prodigality of that emperor; but it was found that most of them had already dissipated their ill-gotten wealth. Galba, or, rather, the intimates who governed him, then proceeded against the purchasers of their property, and confiscations became again the order of the day. The new emperor, at the same time, exercised great parsimony in his administration, and endeavoured to enforce strict discipline among the soldiers, who had been used to the prodigality and license of the previous reign. Being past seventy years of age, Galba, on this and other accounts, soon became <figure id="fig.00704">

</figure> <cb /> the object of popular dislike and ridicule, and revolts against him broke out in various quarters, several of which were put down and punished severely. Galba thought of strengthening himself by adopting Piso Licinianus, a young patrician of considerable personal merit, as Caesar and his successor; upon which Otho, who had expected to be the object of his choice, formed a conspiracy among the Guards, who proclaimed him emperor. Galba, unable to walk, caused himself to be carried in a litter, hoping to suppress the mutiny; but, at the appearance of Otho's armed partisans, his followers left him, and even the litter-bearers threw the old man down and ran away. Some of the legionaries came up and put Galba to death, after a reign of only seven months, counting from the time of Nero's death, A.D. 68. Galba was seventy-two years old when he was taken off. He was succeeded by Otho ( <title>Galba;</title>  <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 4</bibl> foll.; Dio Cass. lxiii. 29, lxiv. 1 foll.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κράνος</foreign>, poet. <foreign lang="greek">κόρυς, πήληξ</foreign>). A helmet, casque. The helmet was originally made of skin or leather, whence is supposed to have arisen its appellation, <foreign lang="greek">κυνέη</foreign>, meaning properly a helmet of dogskin, but applied to caps or helmets made of the hide of other animals, not necessarily worn as armour (<foreign lang="greek">ταυρείη, κτιδέη</foreign>,  <bibl n="Hom.

The leathern basis of the helmet was also very commonly strengthened and adorned by the addition of either bronze or gold ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 352" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 352</bibl>). Helmets which had a metallic basis were in Latin properly called <seg lang="la">cassides</seg> ( <bibl n="Stat.

Il. 10. 265" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>x. 265</bibl>) and sponge (Aristot. <title>H. A.</title> v. 16).</p>
 <p>The helmet, especially that of skin or leather, was sometimes a mere cap conformed to the shape of the head, without either crest or any other ornament. In this state it was probably used in hunting (<seg lang="la">galea venatoria</seg>, C. Nep. <bibl n="Nep. Dat. 3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Dat.</title>iii. 2</bibl>), and was called <foreign lang="greek">καταῖτυξ</foreign>, in Latin <seg lang="la">cudo.</seg> The preceding illustration shows an example of it as worn by Diomede in a small Greek bronze, which is also in the collection at Goodrich Court. The additions by which the external appearance of the helmet was varied, and which served both for ornament and protection, were the following: (1) The <foreign lang="greek">φάλος</foreign>, which was either single, double (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφίφαλος, δίφαλος</foreign>), or quadruple (<foreign lang="greek">τετράφαλος</foreign>). It has been held that the <foreign lang="greek">φάλος</foreign> was the projecting peak of the helmet. According to this 
<pb n="705" /><cb />view, <foreign lang="greek">τετράφαλος</foreign> is admittedly unintelligible, and it is certain that the <foreign lang="greek">φάλος</foreign> was a ridge of metal, afterwards called <foreign lang="greek">κῶνος</foreign> (Buttmann), which served as a support for the crest. Instances occur where there are two or more such ridges. In the illustration below, from a gem with the head of Athené Parthenos, the <foreign lang="greek">φάλοι</foreign> are represented by <figure id="fig.00705">
<head orig="Helmets. (From gems.)">Helmets. (From gems.)</head>
</figure> a Sphinx and two Pegasi.</p>
 <p>(2) The helmet thus adorned was very commonly surmounted by the crest (<seg lang="la">crista</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">λόφος</foreign>), which was often of horse-hair (<foreign lang="greek">ἵππουρις, ἱπποδάσεια</foreign>, <seg lang="la">hirsuta iuba</seg>, Propert. iv. 11, 19), and made so as to look imposing and terrible. The helmet often had two or even three crests (cf. the illustration above with the head of Athené, having a helmet with a triple crest). In the Roman army of later times the crest served not only for ornament, but also to distinguish the centurions (Veget. ii. 13). The annexed illustration from <figure id="fig.00705.2">

 <p>(3) The two cheekpieces (<seg lang="la">bucculae</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">παραγναθίδες</foreign>), which were usually attached to the helmet by hinges, so as to be lifted up and down. They had buttons or ties at their extremities for fastening the helmet on the head. A strap passed under the wearer's chin, in the case of the Homeric helmet ( <bibl n="Hom.

<head orig="Galēnus">Galenus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossclaudius">Claudius</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Κλαύδιος Γαληνός</foreign>). A celebrated Greek physician, born at Pergamus about A.D. 131. His father gave him a liberal education. His anatomical and medical studies were commenced under Satyrus, a celebrated anatomist; Stratonicus, a disciple of the Hippocratic School; and Aeschrion, a follower of the Empirics. After the death of his father he travelled to Alexandria, at that time the most famous school of medicine in the world. His studies were so successfully pursued that he was publicly invited to return to his native country. At the age of thirty-four he settled at Rome, where his celebrity became so great from the success of his practice, and more especially from his great knowledge of anatomy, that he quickly drew upon himself the jealousy of all the Roman physicians. He became physician to the emperor Marcus Aurelius, and at the solicitation of many philosophers and men of rank, he commenced <cb /> a course of lectures on anatomy; but the jealousy of his rivals quickly compelled him to discontinue them, and eventually to leave Rome altogether, being in daily fear of assassination. Many particulars of his life may be gathered from his own writings; nothing is known, however, about the period of his return home as well as that of his death. All that can be learned is merely that he was still living in the reign of Septimius Severus.</p>
 <p>Galen was a most prolific writer. Though several of his works were destroyed in the conflagration of his dwelling, and others by the lapse of time, still the following productions of his now exist in print: (1) Eighty-three treatises, the genuineness of which is now well established.</p>
 <p>(2) Nineteen of rather doubtful origin.</p>
 <p>(3) Forty-five that are certainly spurious.</p>
 <p>(4) Nineteen fragments, more or less extensive in size.</p>
 <p>(5) Fifteen commentaries on the works of Hippocrates.</p>
 <p>Among the productions of Galen that are of a philosophical character may be enumerated the following: A treatise against Favorinus; a dissertation on the opinions of Hippocrates and Plato; a commentary on the Timaeus of Plato, and several discourses on Dialectics. See Diels, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Galeni Historia Philosopha</title> (Bonn, 1870)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Operative surgery is the department of his profession which is least indebted to him; and yet even here he has left some monuments of his boldness and ingenuity. He has described minutely an operation performed by him upon the chest of a young man, by which he perforated the breast-bone and laid bare the heart, in order to give vent to a collection of matter seated in the thorax. The subject of ulcers is handled by him very scientifically in his book <title>De Methodo Medendi</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεραπευτικὴ Μέθοδος</foreign>). His commentaries on Hippocrates show his acquaintance with fractures and dislocations. The subject of hygiene (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑγιεινά</foreign>) he treated at great length in a work consisting of six books. His treatise <title>De Facultate Alimentorum</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Τροφῶν Δυνάμεως</foreign>) contains very important observations on the nature of foods, and furnishes an exposition of his opinion on the subject of dietetics. Materia Medica and Pharmacy appear to have been the objects of his particular study, and both are handled by him in several of his works. His treatise <title>De Compositione Medicamentorum Secundum Locos</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Συνθέσεως Φαρμάκων τῶν κατὰ Τόπους</foreign>) contains a copious list of pharmaceutical preparations. Of all his works, none was long so much studied and commented upon as the one entitled <title>Ars Medica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Τέχνη Ἰατρική</foreign>), a general outline of medicine. In several works he gives an elaborate system of the arterial pulses, which, as usual with his doctrines, was taken up by all subsequent writers; and abridged expositions of it may be found in Philaretus, Paulus Aegineta, Actuarius, Rhazes, and Avicenna.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γαλιλαία</foreign>, from the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">galil</hi>, “a circle” or “circuit”). A celebrated country of Palestine, forming the northern division. Iosephus (<title>Bell. Iud.</title> iii. 3) divides it into Upper and Lower, and he states that the limits of Galilee were, on the south, Samaris and Scythopolis to the flood of Jordan. It contained four tribes— Issachar, Zebulon, Naphthali, and Asher—a part also of Dan, and part of Peraea, or the country beyond Jordan. Upper Galilee was mountainous, and was called Galilee of the Gentiles from the heathen nations established there who were enabled, by the mountainous nature of the country, to maintain themselves against all invaders. Strabo enumerates among its inhabitants, Egyptians, Arabians, and Phoenicians. Lower Galilee, which contained the tribes of Zebulon and Asher, was adjacent to the Sea of Tiberias or Lake of Gennesareth. Galilee, according to Iosephus, was very populous, contained 204 cities and towns, and paid 200 talents in tribute. Its principal city was Caesarea Philippi. The inhabitants of Galilaea were very industrious, and, being bold and intrepid soldiers, they bravely resisted the nations around them. The Jews of Iudaea regarded them with much contempt. Their language was a corrupt and unpolished dialect of Syriac, with a mixture of other languages. It was probably this corrupt dialect that led to the detection of Peter as one of Christ's disciples (Mark, xiv. 70). The Saviour was called a Galilean (Matt. xxvi. 69), because he was brought up at Nazareth, a city of Galilaea; and as his apostles were mostly, <cb /> if not all, natives of this province, they also are called Galileans and “men of Galilee” (Acts, i. 11).

 <p>The origin of the name of Galli is not absolutely certain, but it was doubtless a native Phrygian word; of course it has nothing to do with the Galatae or Gauls, whose first appearance in these countries dates only from B.C. 278. There is no reason to reject the tradition which derives

 <p> An extensive and populous country of Europe, bounded on the west by the Atlantic, on the north by the Insula Batavorum and part of the Rhenus (Rhine), on the east by the Rhenus and the Alps, and on the south by the Pyrenees. The greatest breadth was 600 English miles, but much diminished towards each extremity. Its length was from 480 to 620 miles. It was therefore more extensive than modern France before the Revolution, though inferior to the Empire under Napoleon I. Gaul was originally divided among the three great peoples—the Belgae, the Celtae, and the Aquitani. The Romans called the inhabitants of this country by one general name, Galli, while the Greeks styled them <foreign lang="greek">Κελταί</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossceltae">Celtae</ref>.) The Greeks called the country itself Galatia (<foreign lang="greek">Γαλατία</foreign>) and Celtica (<foreign lang="greek">Κελτική</foreign>). Of the three great nations of Gaul, the Celtae were the most extensive and the Belgae the bravest. The Belgae and Celtae were of like blood, though differing in temperament, the Belgae being more staid and less impulsive and vivacious, while the Celtae showed the mercurial disposition of the modern French. The Aquitani, on the south, were of a different (Iberian) stock, unlike the rest of the Gauls both physically and temperamentally, being dark of complexion, less sociable, and somewhat less intelligent, but more tenacious of purpose and enduring— traits which still mark the inhabitants of the Basque provinces to-day. The Celtae extended from the Sequana (Seine) in the north to the Garumna (Garonne) in the south. Above the Celtae lay the Belgae, between the Seine and the Lower Rhine. They were intermixed with Germanic tribes. The Aquitani lay between the Garonne and the Pyrenees, and were intermingled with Spanish tribes. These three great divisions, however, were subsequently altered by Augustus (B.C. 27), who extended <ref type="cross" target="crossaquitania">Aquitania</ref> into Celtica as far as the Liger or Loire; the remainder of Gallia Celtica above the Liger was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gallia Lugdunensis</hi>, from the colony of Lugdunum (Lyons); while the territory towards the Rhine was added to the Belgae under the title of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gallia Belgĭca</hi>. Lastly, the south of Gaul, which, from having been the first provinces possessed by the Romans, had been styled Gallia Provincia, was distinguished by the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Narbonensis</hi>, from the city of Narbo (Narbonne). This province was also anciently called Gallia Bracata, from the <seg lang="la">bracae</seg> or trousers worn by the inhabitants; while Gallia Celtica was styled Comata, from the long hair (<seg lang="la">coma</seg>) worn by the natives. These four great provinces, <cb /> in later ages, were called the four Gauls, and subdivided into seventeen others.</p>
 <p>As far back as one can penetrate into the history of the West, we find the race of the Gauls occupying that part of the continent comprehended between the Rhine, the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pyrenees, and the Ocean, as well as the two great islands situated to the northwest, opposite the mouths of the Rhine and Seine. Of these two islands, the one nearer the continent was called <title>Alb-in</title>, “White Island” (cf. the remark of Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 14. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xiv. 16</bibl>, <title>Albion insula, sic dicta ab albis rupibus quas mare alluit</title>”). The other island bore the name of <title>Er-in</title>, “Isle of the West” (from <title>Eir</title> or <title>Iar</title>, “the west”). The continental territory received the special appellation of <title>Galltachd</title>, “Land of the Gauls.” From this word the Greeks formed <foreign lang="greek">Γαλατία</foreign>, and from this latter the generic name of <foreign lang="greek">Γαλάται</foreign>. The Romans proceeded by an inverse method, and from the generic term Galli deduced the geographical denomination Gallia.</p>
 <p>The population of Gaul was divided into families or tribes, forming among themselves many distinct communities or nations. Oftentimes they united together, in their turn, and formed confederations or leagues. Such were the confederations of the Celtae, Aedui, Armorici, Arverni, etc.</p>
 <p>The Gaul was robust and of tall stature. His complexion was fair, his eyes blue, his hair of a blond or chestnut colour, to which he endeavoured to give a red or flaming hue by certain applications (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 28. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxviii. 12</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 33</bibl>). The hair itself was worn long ( <bibl n="Diod.  5. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.v. 28</bibl>). The beard was allowed to grow by the people at large; the nobles, on the other hand, removed it from the face, excepting the upper lip, where they wore thick moustaches. The attire common to all the tribes consisted of trousers or <seg lang="la">bracae</seg> (Armoric). These were of striped materials. They wore also a short cloak, having sleeves, likewise formed of striped materials, and descending to the middle of the thigh. Over this was thrown a short cloak or <seg lang="la">sagum </seg> (<hi rend="italic">sae</hi>, Armoric; cf. Isidor. <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 19. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xix. 24</bibl>), striped like the shirt, or else adorned with flowers and other ornamental work, and, among the rich, superbly embroidered with silver and gold ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 660" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>viii. 660</bibl>; Sil. Ital. iv. 152; <bibl n="Diod.  5. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.v. 28</bibl>). It covered the back and shoulders, and was secured under the chin by a clasp of metal. The lower classes, however, wore in place of it the skin of some animal, or else a thick and coarse woolen covering. The offensive arms of the nation were, at first, hatchets and knives of stone; arrows point<figure id="fig.00707">
<head orig="Head of Gaul. (Villa Amendola.)">Head of Gaul. (Villa Amendola.)</head>
</figure> ed with flint or shells; clubs; spears hardened in the fire, and named <hi rend="italic">gaïs</hi> (in Latin <seg lang="la">gaesum</seg>, in Greek <foreign lang="greek">γαισόν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">γαισός</foreign>); and others called <seg lang="la">cateïa</seg>, which they hurled while on fire against the enemy. Foreign traffic, however, made them acquainted, in process of time, with arms of iron, as well as with the art of manufacturing them for themselves from the copper and iron of their own mines. Among the arms of metal which thenceforward came into use may be mentioned the long sabre of iron or copper and a pike resembling the halberd, the wound inflicted 
<pb n="708" /><cb /> by which was considered mortal. For a long time the Transalpine as well as the Cisalpine warriors of the Gallic race had rejected the use of defensive armour as inconsistent with true courage, and a point of honour had induced them even to strip off their vestments and engage naked with the foe. This prejudice, however, was almost entirely effaced in the second century when the military costume of Rome and Greece formed a singular combination with the ancient array of the Gaul. To a helmet of metal, of greater or less value according to the fortune of the warrior, were attached the horns of an elk, buffalo, or stag; while for the rich there was a headpiece representing some bird or savage beast, the whole being surmounted by a bunch of feathers, which gave to the warrior a gigantic appearance ( <bibl n="Diod.  5. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.v. 28</bibl>). Similar figures were attached to their bucklers, which were long, quadrangular, and painted with the brightest colours. A buckler and casque after this model, a cuirass of wrought metal, after the Greek and Roman fashion, or a coat of mail formed of iron rings, after the manner of Gaul (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> iv. 20); an enormous sabre hanging on the right thigh, and suspended by chains of iron or brass from a belt glittering with gold and silver, and adorned with coral; a collar, bracelets, rings of gold around the arm and on the middle finger (<bibl n="Plin.  33. 1" default="NO">Pliny, xxxiii. 1</bibl>); trousers; a <seg lang="la">sagum</seg> hanging from the shoulder; and long red moustaches—such was the Gallic warrior.</p>
 <p>Hardy, daring, impetuous, born, as it were, for martial achievements, the Gallic race possessed, at the same time, an ingenious and active turn of mind. They were not slow in equalling their Phoenician and Grecian instructors in the art of mining. The same superiority to which the Spaniards had attained in tempering steel, the Gauls acquired in the preparation of brass. Antiquity assigns to them the honour of various useful inventions, which had hitherto escaped the earlier civilization of the East and of Italy. The process of tinning was discovered by the Bituriges; that of veneering by the Aedui (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 17</bibl>). The dyes, too, of Gaul were not without reputation (<bibl n="Plin.  8. 48" default="NO">Pliny, viii. 48</bibl>). In agriculture, the wheelplough and boulter were Gallic discoveries (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 18</bibl>; xviii. 11). With the Gauls, too, originated the employment of marl for enriching the soil (<bibl n="Plin.  18. 6" default="NO">Pliny, xviii. 6</bibl> foll.). The cheeses of Mount Lozère, among the Gabali; those of Nemausus; and two kinds made among the Alps, became, in time, much sought after by the inhabitants of Italy (<bibl n="Plin.  11. 49" default="NO">Pliny, xi. 49</bibl>). The Gauls also prepared various kinds of fermented drinks, such as barley-beer, called <seg lang="la">cervisia</seg> (<bibl n="Plin.  22. 15" default="NO">Pliny, xxii. 15</bibl>); and likewise another kind of beer, made from corn, and in which honey, cumin, and other ingredients were mingled. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscervesia">Cervisia</ref>.) The froth of beer was employed as a means for leavening bread: it was used also as a cosmetic, and the Gallic women frequently applied it to the face, under the belief that it imparted a freshness to the complexion (<bibl n="Plin.  22. 25" default="NO">Pliny, xxii. 25</bibl>). It was from the Greeks of Massilia that they learned the process of making wine, as well as the culture of the grape.</p>
 <p>The dwellings of the Gauls, spacious and of a round form, were constructed of posts and hurdles, and covered with clay both within and without; a large roof, composed of oak-shingles and stubble, or of straw cut and kneaded with clay, covered the <cb /> whole (Vitruv. i. 1). Gaul contained both open villages and cities: the latter, surrounded by walls, were defended by a system of fortification, of which we find no example elsewhere. Caesar gives a description of these ramparts (<title>B. G.</title> vii. 23). To the <figure id="fig.00708">
<head orig="Restoration of Wall of Mursceints. (Duruy.)">Restoration of Wall of Mursceints. (Duruy.)</head>
</figure> north and east, among the more savage tribes, there were no cities properly so called; the inhabitants resided for the most part in large enclosures, formed of trunks of trees.</p>
 <p>It was, as has been already remarked, in war, and in the arts applicable to war, that the genius of the Gauls displayed itself to most advantage. This people made war a regular profession, while the management of arms became their favourite employment. To have a fine martial mien, to retain for a long period strength and agility of body, was not only a point of honour for individuals, but a duty to the State. At regular intervals, the young men went to measure their size by a girdle deposited with the chief of the village, and those whose corpulence exceeded the official standard were severely reprimanded as idle and intemperate persons, and were, besides, punished with a heavy fine. In preparing for foreign expeditions, a chieftain of acknowledged valour generally formed a small army around him, consisting, for the most part, of adventurers and volunteers who had flocked to his standard; these were to share with him whatever booty might be obtained. In internal wars, however, or defensive ones of any importance, levies of men were forcibly made; and severe punishments were inflicted on the refractory, such as the loss of noses, ears, an eye, or some one of the limbs ( <title>B. G.</title> vi. 4). If any dangerous crisis arrived, the supreme chief convened an armed council ( <title>B. G.</title> v. 66). All persons able to bear arms were compelled to assemble at the place and day indicated, for the purpose of deliberating on the situation of the country, of electing a chief, and of discussing the plan of campaign. It was expressly provided by law that the individual who came last to the place of rendezvous should be cruelly tortured in the presence of the assembled multitude ( <title>B. G.</title> v. 66). This form of assembly was, however, of rare occurrence, and was only resorted to in the last extremity. Neither infirmities nor age freed the Gallic noble from the necessity of accepting or seeking military commands. Oftentimes were seen, at the head of the forces, chieftains hoary and almost enfeebled by age, who could even scarcely retain their seats on the horse which supported them ( <title>B. G.</title> viii. 12). This people would have believed that they dishonoured their aged warriors by making them die elsewhere than on the field of battle. 
<pb n="709" /><cb /></p>
 <p>To the ferocity of the attack and to the violence of the first shock were reduced nearly all the military tactics of the Gauls on level ground and in pitched battle. In the mountainous regions, on the other hand, and especially in the vast and thick forests of the North, war had a close resemblance to the chase: it was prosecuted in small parties, by ambuscades and all sorts of stratagems; and dogs, trained up to pursue men, tracked out and aided in conquering the foe (Silius Ital. x. 77; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 533" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>i. 533</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  3. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iii. 47</bibl>). A Gallic army generally carried along with it a multitude of chariots for the baggage, which embarrassed its march ( <title>B. G.</title> viii. 14; <title>B. G.</title> i. 51). Each warrior bore a bundle of straw, put up like a sack, on which he was accustomed to sit in the encampment, or even in the line of battle while waiting the signal to engage ( <title>B. G.</title> viii. 15).</p>
 <p>The Gauls, like other nations, for a long period were in the habit of killing their prisoners of war, either by crucifixion, or by tying them to trees as a mark for their weapons, or by consigning them to the flames amid cruel rites. Long prior, however, to the second century of our era, these barbarous practices were laid aside, and the captives of transalpine nations had nothing to fear but servitude. Another custom, not less savage, that of cutting off the heads of their slain enemies on the field of battle, was not slower in disappearing. It was long a settled rule in all wars that the victorious army should possess itself of such trophies as these; the common soldiers fixed them on the points of their spears, the horsemen wore them suspended by the hair from their horses; and in this way the conquerors returned to their homes, making the air resound with their triumphal shouts. Each one then hastened to nail up these hideous testimonials of his valour to the gate of his dwelling; and, as the same thing was done with the trophies of the chase, a Gallic village bore a strong resemblance to a charnel-house. Carefully embalmed and saturated with oil of cedar, the heads of hostile chieftains and of famous <figure id="fig.00709">
<head orig="Tomb of Gallic Chief. (Musée de Cluny, Paris.)">Tomb of Gallic Chief. (Musee de Cluny, Paris.)</head>
</figure> warriors were deposited in large coffers, and arranged by their possessor according to the date of acquisition. Sometimes the skull, cleansed and set in gold or silver, served as a cup in the temples, or circulated in the festivities of the banquet, and the guests drank out of it to the glory of the victor and the triumphs of their country. These fierce and brutal manners prevailed for a long period over the whole of Gaul. Civilization, in its on ward march, abolished them by degrees, until, at the commencement of the second century, they were confined to the savage tribes of the North and West. It was there that Posidonius found them still existing in all their vigour, when the sight of so many human <cb /> heads, disfigured by outrages and blackened by the air and the rain, roused in him mingled emotions of horror and disgust.</p>
 <p>The Gauls affected, as more manly in its character, a strong and rough tone of voice ( <bibl n="Diod.  5. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.v. 31</bibl>). They conversed but little, and by means of short and concise phrases, which the constant use of metaphors and hyperboles rendered obscure and almost unintelligible to strangers. But, when once animated by dispute, or incited by something that was calculated to interest or arouse, at the head of armies or in political assemblies, they expressed themselves with copiousness and fluency.</p>
 <p>The Gauls, in general, were accused of drinking to excess—a habit which took its rise both in the grossness of their manners and in the wants of a cold and humid climate. The Massilian and Italian traders were not slow in furnishing the necessary means for the indulgence of this vice. Cargoes of wine found their way, by means of the navigable rivers, into the very heart of the country. Drink was also conveyed over land in wagons ( <bibl n="Diod.  5. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.v. 26</bibl>). About the first century, however, of our era, drunkenness began gradually to disappear from among the higher classes, and to be confined to the lower orders, at least with the nations of the South and East.</p>
 <p>Milk and the flesh of animals, especially that of swine, formed the principal food of the Gauls. A curious account of their repasts is given by Posidonius (<hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Athen. iv. p. 13). After an excessive indulgence in the pleasures of the banquet, they loved to seize their arms and defy each other to the combat. At first it was only a sportive encounter; but, if either party chanced to be wounded, passion got so far the better of them that, unless separated by their friends, they continued to engage till one or the other of them was slain. So far, indeed, did they carry their contempt of death and their ostentatious display of courage, that they might be seen agreeing, for a certain sum of money or for so many measures of wine, to let themselves be slain by others; mounted on some elevated place, they distributed the liquor or gold among their most intimate friends, and then reclining on their bucklers, presented their throats to the sword ( Posidon. l. c.). Others made it a point of honour not to retire from their dwellings when falling in upon them, nor from the flames, nor from the tides of ocean and the inundations of rivers; and it is to this foolish daring that the Gauls owed their fabulous renown of being an impious race, who lived in open war with nature.</p>
 <p>The working of mines, and certain monopolies enjoyed by the heads of tribes, had placed in the hands of some individuals enormous capital; hence the reputation for opulence which Gaul enjoyed at the period of the Roman invasion, and even still later. It was the Peru of the ancient world. The riches of Gaul even passed into a proverb (Ioseph. ii. 28; <title>Caes.;</title>  <title>Caes.</title>, etc.). Posidonius makes mention of a certain Luern or Luer (<foreign lang="greek">Λουέρνιος</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Posidon. ap.</hi> Athen. iv. p. 13; <foreign lang="greek">Λουέριος</foreign>, <bibl n="Strab.  191" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.191</bibl>), king of the Arverni, who caused a shower of gold and silver to descend upon the crowd as often as he appeared in public. He also gave entertainments in a rude style of barbarian magnificence; a large space of ground was enclosed for the purpose, and cisterns were dug in it, which were filled with wine, mead, and beer.</p>
 <p>Properly speaking, there was no domestic union 
<pb n="710" /><cb /> or family intercourse among the Gallic nations; the women were held in dependence and servitude. The husband had the power of life and death over his wife as well as over his offspring. When a person of high rank suddenly died, and the cause of his death was not clearly ascertained, his wife or wives (for polygamy was practised among the rich) were seized and put to the torture; if the least suspicion was excited of their having been privy to his death, the victims perished in the midst of the flames, after the most frightful punishments ( <title>B. G.</title> vi. 19). One custom, however, shows that even then the condition of women had undergone some degree of melioration: this was the community of goods between husband and wife. The children remained under the care of their mother until the age of puberty ( <title>B. G.</title> vi. 18).</p>
 <p>Among some nations of Belgic Gaul, where the Rhine was an object of superstitious adoration, a curious custom prevailed; the river was made the means of testing the fidelity of the wives. When a husband had doubts respecting its paternity, he took the new-born infant, placed it on a board, and exposed it to the current of the stream. If the plank and its helpless burden floated safely upon the waters, the result was deemed favourable, and all the father's suspicions were dissipated. If, on the contrary, the plank began to sink, the infant perished, and the parent's suspicions were confirmed.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Government and Religion</hi>.—Two privileged orders ruled in Gaul over the rest of the population —the priests and the nobles. The people at large were divided into two classes—the inhabitants of the country and the residents of cities. The former of these constituted the tribes or clients appertaining to noble families. The client cultivated his patron's domains, followed his standard in war, and was bound to defend him with his life. To abandon his patron in the hour of peril was regarded as the blackest of crimes. The residents of cities, on the other hand, found themselves beyond the control of this system of clientship, and, consequently, enjoyed greater freedom. Below the mass of the people were the slaves, who do not appear, however, to have been at any time very numerous.</p>
 <p>When we examine attentively the character of the facts relative to the religious belief of Gaul, we are led to recognize the existence of two classes of ideas, two systems of symbols and superstitions entirely distinct from each other; in a word, two religions—one, altogether reasonable in its character, based on the personification of natural phenomena and recalling by its forms much of the polytheism of Greece; the other, founded on a material, metaphysical, mysterious, and sacerdotal pantheism, presenting at least a superficial conformity with the religions of the East. This latter has received the name of Druidism, from the Druids, who were its first founders and priests; the other system has been called the Gallic Polytheism. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdruidae">Druidae</ref>.) Druidism was said to have been established in Gaul by Heus or Hesus, a warrior and law-giver who was subsequently deified. The polytheistic system which prevailed, more especially in Southern Gaul, was fundamentally like that of the Greeks and Romans themselves. In its list of deities were Tarann, the god of thunder, the Gallic Zeus, though in <cb /> parts of Gaul Hesus held this supremacy; Pennin, the god of the mountains (<bibl n="Liv.  21. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxi. 38</bibl>); Bel or Belew, the sun-god, the Gallic Apollo (Auson. <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>2</bibl>); Teutates, the Gallic Hermes, presiding over the useful arts and commerce ( Fel. <bibl n="Minuc.  30" default="NO">Minuc.30</bibl>; Lactant. <title>Div. Inst.</title> i. 21); Ogmius, represented as leading a train of captives by chains of gold and amber proceeding from his mouth, typifying the power of eloquence; and Arduenna, the goddess of the forests. These deities, as was natural, were identified by Caesar with the gods of the Roman system ( <title>B. G.</title> vi. 7). </p>
 <p>This resemblance between the two systems of religion changed into identity when Gaul, subjected to the dominion of Rome, had felt for some years the influence of Roman ideas. It was then that the Gallic polytheism, honoured and favoured by the emperors, ended its career by becoming totally merged in the polytheism of Italy; while, on the other hand, Druidism, its mysteries, its doctrine, and its priesthood, were utterly proscribed. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdruidae">Druidae</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">General History</hi>.—The history of Gaul divides itself naturally into four periods. The first of these comprises the movements of the Gallic tribes while yet in their nomadic state. None of the races of the West ever passed through a more agitated or brilliant career. Their course embraced Europe, Asia, and Africa; their name is recorded with terror in the annals of almost every nation. They burned Rome; they wrested Macedonia from the veteran legions of Alexander; they forced Thermopylae and pillaged Delphi; they then proceeded to pitch their tents on the plains of the Troad, in the broad parks of Miletus, on the borders of the Sangarius, and those of the Nile. They besieged Carthage, menaced Memphis, 
<pb n="711" /><cb /> and numbered among their tributaries the most powerful monarchs of the East; they founded in Upper Italy a powerful empire, and in the bosom of Phrygia they reared another—Galatia, which for a long time exercised its sway over the whole of Lower Asia. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgalatia">Galatia</ref>.</p>
 <p>During the Second Period—that of their sedentary state—we see the gradual development of social, religious, and political institutions, conformable to their peculiar character as a people; institutions original in their nature, and a civilization full of movement and of life, of which Transalpine Gaul offers the purest and most complete model. One might say, in following the animated scenes of this picture, that the theocracy of India, the feudal system of the Middle Ages, and the Athenian democracy had met on the same soil for the purpose of contending with each other and reigning by turns. Soon this civilization undergoes a change; foreign elements are introduced, brought in by commerce, by the relations of neighbourhood, by reaction from subjugated nations. Hence arose and multiplied a variety of social combinations. In Italy it is the Roman influence that exerts itself on the manners and institutions of the Gauls; in the south of Gaul it is that of the Massiliots; while in Phrygia one finds a most singular compound of Gallic, Grecian, and Phrygian civilization. To this succeeds the Third Period in the history of the Gallic race—that of national struggles and subjugation. By a singular coincidence, it is always by the Roman sword that the power of the Gallic tribes is destined to fall; in proportion as the Roman dominion extends, that of the Gauls recedes and declines. It would seem, indeed, that the victors and the vanquished, in the battle on the banks of the Allia, followed each other over the whole earth to decide the ancient quarrel of the Capitol. In Italy, the Cisalpine Gauls were reduced, but only after two centuries of obstinate resistance. When the rest of Asia had submitted to the yoke, the Galatae still defended against Rome the independence of the East. Gaul eventually fell, but through complete exhaustion, after a century of partial conflicts and nine years of general war under Caesar. Finally, the names of Caractacus and Galgacus shed a splendour on the last and ineffectual efforts of Keltic freedom. It is everywhere an unequal conflict between ardent and undisciplined valour on the one hand, and cool and steady perseverance on the other. The Fourth Period comprehends the organization of Gaul into a Roman province, and the gradual assimilation of transalpine manners to the customs and institutions of Italy—a work commenced by Augustus and completed by Claudius.

 <p> “Gaul this side of the Alps,” <cb /> with reference to Rome, a name given to the northern part of Italy, as occupied by the Gallic tribes which had poured over the Alps into this extensive tract of country. It is also called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gallia Citerior</hi>. Livy assigns to these migrations of the Gauls as early a date as B.C. 600. Having securely established themselves in their new possessions, they proceeded to make further inroads into various parts of Italy, and thus came into contact with the forces of Rome. More than two hundred years had elapsed from the time of their first invasion, when they totally defeated the Roman army on the banks of the Allia, and became masters of Rome itself. The defence of the Capitol and the exploits of Camillus (<bibl n="Liv.  5. 47" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 47</bibl> foll.), or, rather, if Polybius be correct (ii. 18), the gold of the vanquished and the dangers which threatened the Gauls at home, preserved the State. From that time, the Gauls, though they continued by frequent incursions to threaten and even to ravage the territory of Rome, could make no impression on that power. Though leagued with the Samnites and Etruscans, they were almost always unsuccessful. Defeated at Sentinum in Umbria, near the Lake Vadimonis in Etruria, and in a still more decisive action near the port of Telamo in the same province (Polyb. ii. 19 foll.), they soon found themselves forced to contend, not for conquest, but for existence. The same ill success, however, attended their efforts in their own territory. The progress of the Roman arms was irresistible; the Gauls were beaten back from the Adriatic to the Po, from the Po to the Alps, and soon beheld Roman colonies established and flourishing in many of the towns which had so lately been theirs. Notwithstanding these successive disasters, their spirit, though curbed, was still unsubdued; and when the enterprise of Hannibal afforded them an opportunity of retrieving their losses and wreaking their vengeance on the foe, they eagerly embraced it. It is to their zealous co-operation that Polybius ascribes in a great degree the primary success of that expedition. By the efficient aid which they afforded Hannibal, he was enabled to commence operations immediately after he had set foot in Italy, and to follow up his early success with promptitude and vigour (Poly b. iii. 66). As long as this great commander maintained his ground and gave employment to all the forces of the enemy, the Gauls remained unmolested, and enjoyed their former freedom, without being much burdened by a war which was waged at a considerable distance from their borders; but when the tide of success had again changed in favour of Rome and the defeat of Hasdrubal, together with other disasters, had paralyzed the efforts of Carthage, they once more saw their frontiers menaced; Gaul still offered some resistance, even after Carthage itself had been obliged to sue for peace; but it was weak and unavailing; and about twelve years after the termination of the Second Punic War, it was brought under entire subjection and became a Roman province. Under this condition it continued to receive various accessions of territory as the Romans extended their dominions towards the Alps, till it comprised the whole of that portion of Italy which lies between those mountains and the rivers Magra and Rubicon. It was sometimes known by the name of Gallia Togata (<bibl n="Mela  2. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Mela, ii. 4</bibl>; <bibl n="Plin.  3. 14" default="NO">Plin.iii. 14</bibl>), to distinguish it from Transalpine Gaul, to which the name of Gallia Comata 
<pb n="712" /><cb /> was applied ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 8. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>viii. 9</bibl>). The epithet Togata alludes to the rights of citizenship conferred on the natives of the country. The towns of Cisalpine Gaul obtained the privileges of Latin cities, and, consequently, the right of wearing the Roman toga, by a law of Pompeius Strabo (Ascon. <title>Com. in Or. in Pison.</title> p. 490), about B.C. 88.</p>
 <p>According to Polybius, Cisalpine Gaul was included in the figure of a triangle, which had the Alps and Apennines for two of its sides, and the Adriatic, as far as the city of Sena Gallica, for the base. This is, however, but a rough sketch. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossitalia">Italia</ref>.) Polybius describes the country as abounding in wine, corn, and every kind of grain, and in fine wool. Herds of swine, both for public and private supply, were bred in its forests; and such was the abundance of provisions of every kind that travellers when at an inn did not find it necessary to agree on the price of any article which they required, but paid so much for the whole amount of what was furnished them; and this charge, at the highest, did not exceed half a Roman <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (Polyb. ii. 15).

 <p>A son of the emperor Valerian, made Caesar and colleague to his father in A.D. 253. He defeated, in a great battle near Mediolanum (Milan), the Alemanni and other northern tribes which had made an irruption into Upper Italy, and gave evidence on that occasion of his personal bravery and abilities. He was also well-informed in literature, and was both an orator and a poet, winning some distinction by an epithalamium. When Valerian was taken prisoner by the Persians, A.D. 260, Gallienus took the reins of government, and was acknowledged as Augustus. He appears to have then given himself up to debauchery and the company of profligate persons, neglecting the interests of the Empire, and taking no pains to effect the release of his father from the hard captivity in which he died. The barbarians attacked the Empire on every side, revolts broke out in various provinces, <cb /> where several commanders assumed the title of emperor, while Gallienus was loitering at Rome with his favourites. Yet now and then he seemed to awaken from his torpor at the news of the advance of the invaders; and, putting himself at the head of the legions, he defeated Ingenuus, who had usurped the imperial title in Illyricum. Gallienus disgraced his victory by horrible cruelties. Mean<figure id="fig.00712.2">

Usurpers arose in Egypt, in the Gauls, in Thrace, in almost every province of the Empire, from which circumstance this period has been styled the Reign of the Thirty Tyrants. At last Aureolus, a man of obscure birth, some say a Dacian shepherd originally, but a brave soldier, was proclaimed emperor by the troops in Illyricum, entered Italy, took possession of Mediolanum, and even marched against Rome while Gallienus was absent. Gallienus returned quickly, repulsed Aureolus, and defeated him in a great battle, near the Addua, after which the usurper shut himself up in Mediolanum. Here he was besieged by Gallienus; but, during the siege (A.D. 268), the emperor was murdered by conspirators (Aurel. Vict. 33; Eutrop. ix. 8; Trebell. Poll. <title>Gallien.</title>, Zonaras, xii. 24 foll.). The reign of Gallienus is memorable for the plague that swept over the Empire. During its height, it is said that there were 5000 deaths daily in the city of Rome; while the population of Alexandria was diminished nearly two thirds. The plague was followed by a general famine.

<head orig="Gallīna">Gallina</head>

 <p> A fowl; a chicken. Of the different species of domestic fowls, the most important were <seg lang="la">gallinae</seg>, which were divided into three classes: <seg lang="la">(a) gallinae villaticae</seg>, the common chicken; <title>(b) gallinae Africanae</title> or <title>Numidicae</title>, the same probably with the <foreign lang="greek">μελεαγρίδες</foreign> of the Greeks; and <seg lang="la">(c) gallinae rusticae.</seg> The last were found in great abundance in the Insula Gallinaria, but it is so difficult to determine from the descriptions transmitted to us what they really were, that it is uncertain whether they ought to be regarded as pheasants, as redlegged partridges, as wood-grouse, or as some species of game different from any of these. The <title>Africanae</title>, always scarce and dear, were treated almost exactly in the same manner as peacocks, and never became of importance to the farmer. The <seg lang="la">rusticae</seg> are little spoken of except as objects 
<pb n="713" /><cb /> of curiosity, and Columella declares that they would not breed in confinement.</p>
 <p>Among the breeds celebrated for fighting were the Tanagrian, the Rhodian, and the Chalcidian; but these were not the most profitable for the market. The points of a good barn-yard fowl are minutely described by Varro, Columella, and Palladius. Some were permitted to roam about (<seg lang="la">vagae</seg>) during the day, and pick up what they could, but the greater number were constantly shut up (<seg lang="la">clausae</seg>) in a poultry-yard (<seg lang="la">gallinarium</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ὀρνιθοβοσκεῖον</foreign>), which was an enclosed court (<seg lang="la">saeptum</seg>) with a warm aspect, strewed with sand or ashes wherein they might burrow, and covered over with a net. It contained hen-houses (<seg lang="la">caveae</seg>), to which they retired at night and roosted upon poles stretched across (<seg lang="la">perticae</seg>) for their convenience, nests (<seg lang="la">cubilia</seg>) for the laying hens being constructed along the walls. The whole establishment was under the control of a poultryman (<seg lang="la">aviarius custos</seg> or <seg lang="la">curator gallinarius</seg>).</p>
 <p>Chickens, when fattened for sale, were shut up in dark, narrow cribs, light and motion being unfavourable to the process; or each bird was swung separately in a basket, with a small hole at each end, one for the head, the other for the rump, and bedded upon the softest hay or chaff, but so cramped in space that it could not turn round. In this state it was crammed with wheat, linseed, barley-meal kneaded with water into small lumps (<seg lang="la">turundae</seg>), and other farinaceous food, the operation requiring from twenty to twenty-five days (Varr. iii. 9; Colum. viii. 2, etc., 12;  <bibl n="Plin.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sulpicius</hi>. A distinguished orator, was praetor B.C. 169, and consul 166, when he fought against the Ligurians. In 168 he served as tribune of the soldiers under Aemilius Paulus in Macedonia, and during this campaign predicted an eclipse of the moon.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">C. Cornelius</hi>, was born at Forum Iulii (Fréjus) in Gaul, of poor parents, about B.C. 66. He went to Italy at an early age, and began his career as a poet when he was about twenty years of age. He had already attained considerable distinction at the time of Caesar's death, 44; <cb /> and upon the arrival of Octavianus in Italy after that event, Gallus embraced his party, and soon acquired great influence with him. In 41 he was one of the triumvirs appointed by Octavianus to distribute lands in the north of Italy among his veterans, and on that occasion he afforded protection to the inhabitants of Mantua and to Vergil. He afterwards accompanied Octavianus to the battle of Actium, 31, and commanded a detachment of the army. After the battle, Gallus was sent with the army to Egypt, in pursuit of Antony; and when Egypt was made a Roman province, Octavianus appointed Gallus the first prefect of the province. He remained in Egypt for nearly four years; but he incurred at length the enmity of Octavianus, though the exact nature of his offence is uncertain. According to some accounts he spoke of the emperor in an offensive and insulting manner; he erected numerous statues of himself in Egypt, and had his own exploits inscribed on the pyramids. The Senate deprived him of his estates, and sent him into exile; whereupon he put an end to his life by falling upon his own sword, B.C. 27. The intimate friendship existing between Gallus and the most eminent men of the time, as Asinius Pollio, Vergil, Varus, and Ovid, and the high praise they bestow upon him, prove that he was a man of great intellectual powers and acquirements. Ovid (<title>Trist.</title> iv. 10. 5) assigns to him the first place among the Roman elegiac poets; and we know that he wrote a collection of elegies in four books, the principal subject of which was his love of Lycoris. (See Vergil's Tenth Eclogue.) But all his productions have perished; for the four epigrams in the Latin Anthology attributed to Gallus could not have been written by a contemporary of Augustus. Gallus translated into Latin the poems of Euphorion of Chalcis, but this translation is also lost. Some critics attributed to him the poem <title>Ciris</title>, usually printed among the works of Vergil. See Völker, <title>De C.

He served under Decius in the campaign against the Goths, 251, and is said to have contributed by his treachery to the disastrous issue of the battle, which proved fatal to Decius and his son Herennius. Gallus was thereupon elected emperor, and Hostilianus, the surviving son of Decius, was nominated as his colleague. He purchased a peace of the Goths by allowing them to retain their plunder, and promising them a fixed annual tribute. In 253, the Goths again invaded the Roman Empire, but they were driven back by Aemilianus, whose troops proclaimed him emperor in Moesia. Aemilianus thereupon marched into Italy; and Gallus was put to death by his own soldiers, together with his son Volusianus, before any collision had taken place between the opposing armies. The name of Gallus is associated with nothing but cowardice and dishonour. In addition to the misery produced by the inroads of the barbarians during this reign, a deadly pestilence broke out in 252, and continued its ravages over every part of the Empire for fifteen years.

A famous river of India, which, in the language of Hindustan, is called Padda, and is also named Burra Gangâ, or the <cb /> Great River, and Gangâ, or the river, by way of eminence; and hence the European name of the stream is derived. The Sanskrit name of the Ganges (Padda) signifies “foot,” because the Brahmins, in the <title>Vishnu-Purana</title>, make the river to flow from the great toe of the left foot of Vishnu, the preserving deity. This mighty stream, together with the Brahmaputra, whose twin-sister it has been denominated, has its source in the vast mountains of Thibet. This river was unknown to Herodotus, as he does not mention it, though it became famous a century afterwards. Its source was for a long period involved in obscurity. A survey, however, was made by the Anglo-Indian government, and it was found to issue in a small stream, under the name of Bhagirathi, from under a mass of perpetual snow, accumulated on the southern side of the Himalayah Mountains. It is computed to be 1557 miles in length, and at five hundred miles from its mouth is, during the rainy season, four miles broad and sixty feet deep. Its principal tributaries are the Jumna, the Jahnavi, and the Brahmaputra. The whole number of streams which flow into it is eleven.</p>

It was, however, an important and strongly-fortified place, as being situated so near the borders of that country. Alexander took and pillaged it, after it had made a powerful resistance for the space of three months (Arrian, ii. 27; Quintus Curtius, iv. 6). Antiochus the Great sacked it, and it was several times taken from the Syrians by the Maccabees (Iosephus, <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xiii. 21).

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aulus</hi>. A Latin grammarian, born at Rome in the early part of the second century, and who died at the beginning of the reign of Marcus Aurelius. We have but few particulars of his life, though it is known that he studied rhetoric under Antonius Iulianus and Sulpicius Apollinaris at Rome, and philosophy under Favorinus at Athens, and that, on his return to Rome, while still at an early age, he was made one of the centumviri or judges in civil causes (<title>Noct. Att.</title> xiv. 2). Gellius has left behind him one work, entitled <cb /> <title>Noctes Atticae</title>, “Attic Nights.” It was written, as he informs us in the preface, during the winter evenings in Attica, to amuse his children in their hours of relaxation. It appears from his own account that he had been accustomed to keep a commonplace book, in which he entered whatever he heard in conversation, or met with in his private reading, that appeared worthy of remembrance. In composing his <title>Noctes Atticae</title>, he seems merely to have copied the contents of his commonplace book, with a little alteration in the language, but without any attempt at classification or arrangement. It is, in fact, a huge scrap-book containing anecdotes and arguments, bits of history and pieces of poetry, and dissertations on various points in philosophy, geometry, and grammar. Amid much that is trifling and puerile, it gives information on many subjects relating to antiquity of which we must otherwise have been ignorant. It is divided into twenty books, which are still extant, excepting the eighth and the first part of the preface to the whole. Of the eighth book, the table of contents has come down. He mentions, in the conclusion of his preface, his intention of continuing the work, which purpose he probably, however, never carried into effect. The style of Aulus Gellius is in general unfit for imitation. In his fondness for archaisms, he is often carried too far, and introduces too many forms of expression from the earlier comic poets, whom he seems most anxious to take for his models in this respect. That he invented, however, any new terms himself seems hardly probable. His language, in fact, belongs to the so-called African style of Latinity, with a mingling of archaic forms and those that are characteristic of the plebeian speech. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossafrican-period-of-latinity">African Period of Latinity</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.)

<div2 id="crossgelon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Gelon">Gelon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γέλων</foreign>). (1) A native of Gela in Sicily, who rose from the station of a private citizen to be supreme ruler of Gela and Syracuse. He was descended from an ancient family, which originally came from Telos, an island off the coast of Caria, and settled at Gela, when it was first colonized by the Rhodians. During the time that Hippocrates reigned at Gela (B.C. 498-491), Gelon was appointed commander of the cavalry, and greatly distinguished himself in the various wars which Hippocrates carried on against the Grecian cities in Sicily. On the death of Hippocrates, who fell in battle against the Siculi, Gelon seized the supreme power (B.C. 491). Soon afterwards a more splendid prize fell in his way. The nobles and landholders (<foreign lang="greek">γάμοροι</foreign>) of Syracuse, who had been driven from the city by an insurrection of their slaves, supported by the rest of the people, applied to Gelon for assistance. This crafty leader, gladly availing himself of the 
<pb n="717" /><cb /> opportunity of extending his dominions, marched to Syracuse, into which he was admitted by the popular party (B.C. 485), who had not the means of resisting so formidable an opponent ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 154" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 154</bibl> foll.). Having thus become master of Syracuse, he appointed his brother Hiero governor of Gela, and exerted all his endeavours to promote the prosperity of his new acquisition. In order to increase the population of Syracuse, he destroyed Camarina, and removed all its inhabitants, together with a great number of the citizens of Gela, to his favourite city. By his various conquests and his great abilities, he became a very powerful monarch; and therefore, when the Greeks expected the invasion of Xerxes, ambassadors were sent by them to Syracuse, to secure, if possible, his assistance in the war. Gelon promised to send to their aid two hundred triremes, twenty thousand heavyarmed troops, two thousand cavalry, and six thousand light-armed troops, provided the supreme command were given to him. This offer being indignantly rejected by the Lacedaemonian and Athenian ambassadors, Gelon sent, according to Herodotus, an individual named Cadmus to Delphi, with great treasures, and with orders to present them to Xerxes if he proved victorious in the coming war ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 157" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 157</bibl>-164). This statement, however, was denied by the Syracusans, who said that Gelon would have assisted the Greeks, if he had not been prevented by an invasion of the Carthaginians, with a force amounting to three hundred thousand men, under the command of Hamilcar. This great army was entirely defeated near Himera by Gelon and Theron, monarch of Agrigentum, on the same day, according to Herodotus, on which the battle of Salamis was fought ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 165" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 165</bibl> foll.). An account of this expedition is also given by Diodorus Siculus (xi. 21), who states that the battle between Gelon and the Carthaginians was fought on the same day as that at Thermopylae. There seems, indeed, to have been a regular understanding between Xerxes and the Carthaginians, in accordance with which the latter were to attack the Greeks in Sicily, while the Persian monarch was to move down upon Attica and the Peloponnesus.</p>
 <p>Gelon appears to have used with moderation the power which he had acquired by violence, and to have endeared himself to the Syracusans by his just government, and by the encouragement he gave to commerce and the fine arts. Plutarch states that the Syracusans would not allow his statues to be destroyed together with those of the other tyrants, when Timoleon became master of the city ( <title>Timol.</title>). He died B.C. 478, and was succeeded by his brother Hiero (Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> v. 12).

The layers of the stone were so treated that the figures stood out vividly on a dark ground. Mnesarchus of Samos, the father of the philosopher Pythagoras (about B.C. 600) is the oldest Greek jeweller whose name has come down to us. In the fourth century B.C. <figure id="fig.00717.4">

<pb n="718" /><cb /> the most celebrated master was Pyrgoteles, the only artist whom Alexander the Great would allow to cut his likeness. In the age of Augustus we hear of Dioscorides, who cut the emperor's likeness on a stone which was used as a seal by the succeeding Caesars. The Etruscans and Romans took up the art very early, but never attained the same perfection as the Greeks, importing gems largely from both Greece and Egypt. The scarab or beetle-shaped gems, so little valued by the Greeks, were intensely admired by the Etruscans, whose art in so many respects exhibits Egyptian characteristics. <figure id="fig.00718">

 <p>The fashion of making collections of beautiful gems arose as early as the first century B.C. The intaglios, or cut stones, have come down to us in greater numbers than any of the monuments of ancient art. Those which belonged to the advanced periods of style present examples of the most beautiful workmanship, the most original composition, and the most interesting subjects, the latter being mainly taken from mythology. Among the remaining Greek cameos an important place, both for size and beauty, must be given to the Gonzaga Cameo in St. Petersburg. This, it has been conjectured, represents the bust of Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoé, his sister and wife; though it more probably commemorates Nero and Agrippina. The largest and most splendid of the cameos which have come down from the Roman period are those at Vienna and Paris, representing, in groups and figures, the family of Augustus. Gems engraved with humorous designs were called <seg lang="la">grylli.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossantiphilus">Antiphilus</ref>.) These usually combined half a dozen incongruous forms arranged <figure id="fig.00718.2">
<head orig="Gryllus. (King Collection.)">Gryllus. (King Collection.)</head>
</figure> into the semblance of some well-known object, and occasionally with a hidden meaning. Thus, the accompanying example from a gem in the King Collection is made up of a wolf, a boar, and a lizard so blended as to form a helmet, the emblems respectively of Mars, Minerva, and Mercury.</p>
 <p>Whole vessels were sometimes made of single stones, and adorned with reliefs. An instance is the Mantuan Vase now at Brunswick, 6 1/3 inches high, 2 1/3 inches thick, consisting of a single onyx. The lid, handle, and base are of gold. Two parallel lines of gold divide the surface into three parts, the middle one of which has twelve figures, representing the festival of the Thesmophoria, in three groups; while the highest and lowest are adorned <cb /> with leaves, flowers, ears of corn, fruits, bulls' heads, and other objects connected with the worship of Demeter. Works of this kind were sometimes made of coloured glass. The most celebrated instance of this sort is the Portland Vase, found filled with ashes in the tomb of Alexander Severus, and now in the British Museum. Its height is about 10 inches. The material is a dark blue transparent glass, with beautiful reliefs in white opaque enamel.</p>
 <p>Herodotus (vii. 69) speaks of a sharp stone as being used in engraving gems. Many of the ancient gems, especially those used as coins, were engraved with obsidian, of which knives were made. A minute metal disk with a sharp edge and worked by a drill was used in cutting the deeper parts of the pattern. (Cf. Pliny, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 27. 76" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxvii. 76</bibl>; and Murray, <title>Handbook of Greek Archaeology</title>, pp. 147-148). A sort of emery-powder (<seg lang="la">smyris</seg>) was employed to charge the tools. The <seg lang="la">crustae</seg> of diamonds and fragments of <seg lang="la">ostracitis</seg> were used as diamond-points.</p>
 <p>For some account of the extraordinary profusion of precious stones in the East and among the successors of Alexander, see <bibl n="Diod.  18. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xviii. 26</bibl>; Athen. xi. p. 781; <bibl n="Strab.  15." default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.xv.</bibl> p. 718, and other passages quoted by Krause, <title>Pyrgoteles</title>, p. 113.

 <p>Pearls and emeralds were the favourite stones of the Romans. Iulius Caesar gave Servilia, the mother of Brutus, a pearl worth 6,000,000 sesterces ($240,000). The famous pearl which Cleopatra dissolved and drank was one of a pair set in ear-rings, and worth 10,000,000 sesterces ($400,000). Claudius Aesopus, son of the great actor, in imitation of this feat, did the same thing, snatching, however, the gem from the ear of Caecilia Metella, a beauty of the day. Caligula wore pearls on his shoes; Nero had them sprinkled over his bed-coverings. Pliny tells how, at a wedding party—a rather quiet affair—Lollia Paulina, the wife of Caligula, was covered with pearls and emeralds which shone in alternate rows on her head, neck, and fingers, and of which the cost was 40,000,000 sesterces ($1,600,000), as she proved by showing to him the receipted bills for them. “Pearls,” he says in another place, “are the quintessence of extravagance.” Claudius used an emerald as an eye-glass with

 which to watch the circus games. The opal was also much admired, and Pliny tells how one Nonius was proscribed by Antony the triumvir so that he might be robbed of a magnificent opal in his possession. Pliny also speaks of the ruby (<seg lang="la">carbunculus</seg>) and the amethyst as much esteemed. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamethystus">Amethystus</ref>.) The ancients perhaps knew of the diamond, but could not have properly valued it, since the art of polishing and cutting it was not learned until it was discovered in modern times by Berquier of Bruges in the fifteenth century. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossadamas">Adamas</ref>.) Besides being worn in rings, gems were set in <seg lang="la">armillae</seg> or bracelets in many forms, including spirals and bangles; in <seg lang="la">monilia</seg> or necklaces of consecutive rows, one found at Pompeii having seventy-one pendants; and in ear-rings. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossinauris">Inauris</ref>.) Jewels also profusely adorned the drinking-cups used at banquets, and the dainty little boxes of gold and silver used by the ladies in the mysteries of their toilets.</p>
 <p>As might be expected, there was a large traffic in imitations of the precious stones, executed in both paste and glass, and with much fidelity. Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37. 197" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 197</bibl>) speaks of “glass jewels in cheap rings” for the lower classes; and there exist <figure id="fig.00719.2">
<head orig="The Portland Vase. (British Museum.)">The Portland Vase. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> to-day at Rome collections of these imitations which cannot be distinguished from the genuine stones by the eye. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvitrum">Vitrum</ref>.) The stone most successfully copied was the emerald, but we hear of counterfeits of the amethyst, ruby, and sapphire.</p>
 <p>This passion on the part of the wealthy for precious stones was naturally favourable to the growth of mineralogical knowledge. Pliny quotes a large number of writers who had treated of gems between Theophrastus and himself. Some of these writers seem to have had a personal knowledge of India. Pliny devotes the final book of his <title>Historia Naturalis</title> to gems, regarding them as the most perfect works of nature. The book consists of an historical introduction ( 1-5); of an account of the most important gems, arranged by colours ( 6-54); and an account of minor gems in alphabetical order. The book concludes with a few general instructions for detecting fraud. This book, which is the best representative of ancient science in this branch of mineralogy, shows us that the ancients were remarkably close observers of gems, availing themselves of all methods, short of chemical analysis and other instruments of modern physical research. Moreover, in the case of precious stones, minuteness of observation was stimulated by the desire of guarding against or of committing a fraud ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.  197" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 197</bibl> foll.). Besides a minute study of colours of gems, frequently illustrated by Pliny 's felicitous comparisons, the tests enumerated involve a study of weight, consistency (<seg lang="la">corpus</seg>), hardness, conductivity, transparency, diffractive power, friction, taste, and smell.</p>
 <p>There are no traces in Theophrastus of magical <figure id="fig.00719.3">
<head orig="Intaglio, with head of Africa. (King Collection.)">Intaglio, with head of Africa. (King Collection.)</head>
</figure> properties attributed to gems. In Pliny, the doctrines of the Magi are frequently quoted, but usually with ridicule. Some of the medicinal virtues of gems apparently accepted by Pliny may appear little better than the doctrines of the Magi. But while Pliny is not in a position to criticise the alleged virtues of gems applied as medicine, he consistently rejects their supernatural powers under other conditions. The magical system is seen fully developed in the <title>Lithica</title> of Orpheus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamuletum">Amuletum</ref>.) This poem claims to be a statement of the magic properties of gems made by the seer Theodamas to the poet Orpheus. The work is generally assigned to a time subsequent to the edict of Constantius against magic, in A.D. 357, and not long after Valens, although Krause (<title>Pyrgoteles</title>, p. 6) ascribes it to the fifth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c.;</hi> and King dates it “at least as early as the second century B.C.” The latter scholar gives an English verse translation (<title>Precious Stones</title>, p. 375).</p>
 <p>Much confusion and uncertainty exist as to the true nomenclature of gems. Both in ancient and modern times there has been considerable looseness of usage as to the meaning of names. In many 
<pb n="720" /><cb />
 instances where the ancient word exists in modern language, it denotes a stone entirely different from that originally signified. For example, <foreign lang="greek">σάπφειρος</foreign> is certainly the <seg lang="la">lapis lazuli</seg>, and has no connection with the sapphire, which was called <seg lang="la">hyacinthus.</seg></p>

<div2 id="crossgenius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Genius">Genius</head>

 <p> (“creator, begetter,” from <seg lang="la">gigno</seg>). The Italian peoples regarded the Genius as a higher power which creates and maintains life, assists at the begetting and birth of every individual man, determines his character, tries to influence his destiny for good, accompanies him through life as his tutelary spirit, and lives on in the Lares after his death. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslares">Lares</ref>.) As a creative principle, the Genius is attached, strictly speaking, to the male sex only. In the case of women his place is taken by Iuno, the personification of woman's life. Thus, in a house inhabited by a man and his wife, a Genius and a Iuno are worshipped together. <cb /> But in common parlance, it was usual to speak of the Genius of a house, and to this Genius the marriage bed (<seg lang="la">lectus genialis</seg>) was sacred. A man's birthday was naturally the holiday of his attendant Genius, to whom he offered incense, wine, garlands, cakes, everything, in short, but bloody sacrifices, and in whose honour he gave himself up to pleasure and enjoyment; for the Genius wishes a man to have pleasure in the life that he has given him. Hence <figure id="fig.00720">
<head orig="Genius of Wine. (Pompeian Mosaic.)">Genius of Wine. (Pompeian Mosaic.)</head>
</figure> the Romans spoke of enjoying one's self as indulging one's Genius, and of renunciation as spiting him ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>iii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 14</bibl>; <bibl n="Pers.  4. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iv. 27</bibl>). Men swore by their Genius as by their higher self, and by the Genius of persons whom they loved and honoured. The philosophers originated the idea of a man having two Genii, a good and a bad one; but in the popular belief the notion of the Genius was that of a good and beneficent being. Families, societies, cities, and peoples had their Genius as well as individuals. The Genius of the Roman people (<title>Genius Publicus</title> or <title>Genius Populi Romani</title>) stood in the Forum, represented in the form of a bearded <figure id="fig.00720.2"><head>Harpocrates, and Snake as Genius Loci.

<pb n="721" /><cb />
 man crowned with a diadem, a cornucopia in his right hand, and a sceptre in his left. An annual sacrifice was offered to him on the 9th of October. Under the Empire the Genius of Augustus, the founder of the Empire, and of the reigning emperor, were publicly worshipped at the same time. Localities also, such as open spaces, streets, baths, and theatres, had their own Genii <bibl default="NO">(Inscr. Orell. 343, 1697)</bibl>. These were usually represented under the form of snakes; and hence the common habit of keeping tame snakes. See <ref type="cross" target="crossanguis">Anguis</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Greeks also had a similar belief in Genii, calling them <foreign lang="greek">δαίμονες</foreign>, or daemons, of whom Hesiod mentions the number as 30,000, who are appointed to be the ministers of Zeus and the guardians of men. He regards them as the souls of the righteous. Pindar speaks of a <foreign lang="greek">γενέθλιος δαίμων</foreign>, which seems to be exactly the equivalent of the Roman Genius.

These families consisted of some thirty houses, who referred their origin and name to a common ancestor, and observed a common worship, with special priests to superintend it. The objects of this worship were Zeus Herkeios (the god of house and home), Apollo Patroös (the god of the family), the heroes of the family, and other tutelary deities. In case a family worship rose to the dignity of a state ceremonial, the priestly office remained hereditary in the family (<foreign lang="greek">γέννα</foreign>). If there were no nearer relations, the members of the <foreign lang="greek">γέννα</foreign> had a law of inheritance which they observed among themselves.

<head orig="Gens">Gens</head>

 <p> (from the root <hi rend="SmallCaps">gen</hi> of <hi rend="italic">geno=gigno</hi>). A Roman family in the widest sense of the word, descended on the male line from a common ancestor, and therefore bearing a common name. So long as the patricians were the only citizens with full rights, there could of course be no gentes not patrician. The oldest gentes belonged to the tribes of the Latin Ramnes and the Sabine Tities. Besides these there were the gentes belonging to the Alban families, brought to Rome by King Tullus Hostilius; and embodied by the other gentes in the community as a third tribe, the Luceres. These, the most ancient, were called <seg lang="la">gentes maiores</seg> as distinguished from the <seg lang="la">gentes minores</seg>, which included the plebeians whom Tarquinius Priscus raised to the rank of patricians. There were in later times instances of plebeian gentes being raised to patrician rank; but these became rarer and rarer, so that the number of patrician gentes was finally much reduced. During the last years of the Republic we hear of only fourteen still in existence, <cb /> including thirty <seg lang="la">familiae</seg> (or families in the narrower sense). Many large gentes were divided into houses (<seg lang="la">stirpes</seg>) who had a common cognomen in addition to the name of their gens; thus the gens Cornelia included the Cornelii Maluginenses, Cornelii Cossi, Cornelii Scipiones, Cornelii Rufini, Cornelii Lentuli, Cornelii Dolabellae, Cornelii Cethegi, Cornelii Cinnae, Cornelii Sullae. Among the plebeians, as among the patricians, the <seg lang="la">familia</seg> naturally developed into a larger circle of relationship; but gentes in the old sense were not formed by the process. Though the plebeian had his gentile name, and afterwards his <seg lang="la">cognomen</seg>, he had not the real <seg lang="la">ius gentilicium.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossius">Ius</ref>.</p>
 <p>All <seg lang="la">gentiles</seg>, or members of a gens, had a right to its common property, which included a common burial-place. They also had a testamentary law of their own which lasted on into the imperial period. When a member of a gens died without heirs of his body, the next to inherit (as in the case of the plebeians) were the <seg lang="la">agnati</seg>, or <seg lang="la">gentiles</seg> on the male side, who could prove their relationship: failing these, the <seg lang="la">gentiles</seg> divided the inheritance. The existence of this law rendered it, in old times, necessary to obtain the <seg lang="la">consensus</seg> of the whole gens in cases of adoption and testamentary bequest. Another consequence of it was, that it was the duty of the <seg lang="la">gentiles</seg> to provide a <seg lang="la">curator</seg> for insane persons and spendthrifts, and a guardian for minors. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurator">Curator</ref>.</p>
 <p>Every gens had its meetings, at which resolutions were passed binding its individual members in matters affecting the gens. It was a decree of the gens Manlia, for instance, which forbade any one of its members to bear the praenomen Marcus. As every <seg lang="la">familia</seg>, whether patrician or plebeian, had certain sacrifices which it was bound to perform, so had every gens, as a larger or extended <seg lang="la">familia.</seg> All members of the gens were entitled, and indeed bound, to take part in the <seg lang="la">sacra gentilicia</seg>, or common worship of the gens. These <seg lang="la">sacra</seg> ceased to exist with the extinction of a gens; and if a member of a gens left it, this right and duty also came to an end. It should be added that certain public religious services were assigned to particular gentes, that of Hercules, for instance, to the gens Pinaria.

<head orig="Gensĕric">Genseric</head>

 <p> (more correctly <hi rend="bold">Gaiserich</hi>). A king of the Vandals, was the illegitimate son of Godigiselus, succeeding his brother Gonderic in A.D. 429. In the same year he left Spain, which had been partly conquered by the Vandals, and crossed over into Africa, at the solicitation of Boniface, governor of that province, who had been induced, by the arts of his rival Aetius, to rebel against Valentinian III., emperor of the West. Boniface soon repented of the step he had taken, and advanced to meet the invader. But his repentance came too late. The Moors joined the standard of Genseric, and the powerful sect of the Donatists, who had been bitterly attacked by the Catholics, assisted him against their adversaries. Boniface was defeated, and obliged to retire into Hippo Regius, where he remained till he obtained a fresh supply of troops. Having ventured upon a second battle, and being again defeated, he abandoned the province to the barbarians, and sailed away to Italy. Hippo Regius fell after a siege of thirteen months, and was sacked with an almost infernal fury, which laid waste indiscriminately churches, fields, and houses, 
<pb n="722" /><cb /> and earned for the name of Vandal the enduring infamy which a proverb can confer. A peace was concluded between Genseric and the Emperor of the West, by which all Africa to the west of Carthage was ceded to the Vandals. This peace, however, did not long continue, and the city of Carthage was taken by the Vandals, by surprise, A.D. 439. The Emperors of the West and East made great preparations for the recovery of the province, but an alliance which Genseric made with Attila, king of the Huns, effectually secured him against their attempts. Genseric's next object was the formation of a naval power. An immense number of ships were built, and his fleets ravaged the shores of Sicily and Italy. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossattila">Attila</ref>.) Invited by the empress Eudoxia, he sailed up the Tiber, A.D. 455, and permitted his soldiers, for the space of fourteen days, to pillage Rome. In A.D. 460 he destroyed the fleet which the emperor Majorian had collected for the invasion of Africa; and, as his power increased, his ravages became more extensive. The island of Sardinia was conquered, and Spain, Italy, Sicily, Greece, Egypt, and Asia Minor were plundered every year by the Vandal pirates. Leo, the emperor of the East, at last resolved to make a vigorous effort for the recovery of Africa. A great army was assembled, and the command was given to Basilicus. He landed at Bona, and at first met with considerable success, but was at length obliged to retire from the province. After this victory Genseric met with no further opposition, but remained undisturbed master of the sea till his death, which happened A.D. 477. He was succeeded by his son Hunneric. Genseric was an Arian, and is said to have persecuted the Catholics with great cruelty (Procopius, <title>De Bell. Vand.;</title> Gibbon, <title>Decline and Fall</title>, chaps. xxxiii.-xxxvi.).

<head orig="Geographia">Geographia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γεωγραφία</foreign>). The world, as conceived of in the <title>Iliad</title>, is a round plain encircled by a great river, Oceanus—not the Atlantic, of which Homer seems to have no knowledge at all, but a purely mythical stream. The sky is a great concave roof propped up by pillars which the mighty <ref type="cross" target="crossatlas">Atlas</ref> (q.v.) upholds. On the large, flat disc of the earth is a sort of belt or zone, of which Homer appears to have a definite notion. It includes Greece, <cb /> for which, however, he has no collective name, since with him Hellas denotes only a district of Thessaly (<title>Iliad</title>, ii. 683). Acarnania and Epirus are not mentioned by name. On the north of the Aegean, the Thracians are known, including the Paeonians along the Axius (ii. 850). In Asia Minor, the topography of the Troad is familiar to the poet; Lydia is mentioned as Maeonia; while his references to the interior of Asia Minor—Phrygia, Pamphylia, etc.—are vaguely indefinite. Of the Aegean islands, Crete, Rhodes, Tenedos, Imbros, Samothrace (Samos), Lesbos, and Lemnos are specifically mentioned. Beyond this belt, Homer knows little or nothing of the world. In the North, the milk-fed nomads are noted (xiii. 5); in the South, the Aethiopes, “remotest of men,” are indicated. Near the banks of Oceanus dwell the Pygmies. The Egyptian Thebes (ix. 381) and Sidon (vi. 289) occur, and the word “Phoenician” appears once (xxiii. 744).</p>
 <p>The <title>Odyssey</title> represents a more extended geographical knowledge. Chios is mentioned; and so are Delos, the Dorians, Ithaca, and Sicily. The Phoenicians are now well known; the Aethiopes <figure id="fig.00722">
<head orig="The World according to Homer.">The World according to Homer.</head>
</figure> are now clearly defined and divided into two sections, the eastern and the western. Scylla and Charybdis, the Lotus-eaters, and the Phaeacians are new. All this, however, is hazy and obscure. (See Jebb, <title>Homer</title>, ch. ii. [Glasgow, 1887].)</p>
 <p>The Phoenicians and their kinsmen, the Carthaginians, by their commercial enterprise, did much to secure a knowledge of the coast of Africa, and sailed westward as far as the Canaries. Herodotus speaks of them as circumnavigating Africa. A famous voyage was that of <ref type="cross" target="crosshanno">Hanno</ref> (q.v.), the Carthaginian, who seems to have gone beyond what is now Sierra Leone. But geographical study and geographical literature took their rise, like historical literature, among the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor. Their extensive commerce and their activity in founding colonies enlarged their geographical horizon. The necessity was thus felt of utilizing and recording the knowledge already 
<pb n="723" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00723">
<head orig="The World as known to the Romans.">The World as known to the Romans.</head>
</figure>
 acquired for the purpose of discovering the form and constitution of the earth. The first attempt at outlining a map of the world was made by Aristagoras of Miletus about B.C. 550. His kinsman Hecataeus, one of the writers called <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign>, who flourished about fifty years later, corrected and enlarged this map and added a commentary. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslogographi">Logographi</ref>.) This commentary, of which only fragments are preserved in quotations, is the oldest piece of purely geographical writing in Greek. The geographical chapters in the history of Herodotus (about B.C. 450) compensate us to a certain extent for the loss of this work, and of the other works of the <foreign lang="greek">λογογράφοι</foreign> on history and geography; but they treat only the eastern half of the then known world. It became, indeed, in the absence of a regular tradition of geographical science, <cb /> a usual thing for historians to insert geographical disquisitions into their works. The writings of Thucydides, Xenophon, Ctesias, Ephorus, Theopompus, Timaeus, and others down to the time of Polybius, afford examples of this.</p>
 <p>The first purely geographical work which has come down to us in a complete state is the <title>Periplus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περίπλους</foreign>), bearing the name of Scylax, written in the first part of the fourth century B.C. It is a description of the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. About the same time the astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus made a great advance in the theory of physical geography. It was he who first adduced mathematical proof of the spherical shape of the earth, which had been asserted before his time by Pythagoras. The division of the globe into five zones (two frigid, two temperate, and one torrid) is also 
<pb n="724" /><cb />
 due to him. About B.C. 330, Pytheas of Massilia (Marseilles) explored towards the northwest as far as the northern end of the British Islands and the coasts of the German Ocean. About the same time, the campaigns of Alexander the Great opened up Asia as far as India to Greek research. Nearchus made a report of exceptional value on his coast voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. All these discoveries were embodied, about B.C. 320, in a new map by Dicaearchus of Messana, a disciple of Aristotle. He was the first scholar who treated physical geography in a scientific manner. He assumed the existence of a southern hemisphere, and made an estimate of the earth's circumference, to which he gave the exaggerated measurement of 40,000 miles. His map remained for a long time the standard work of the kind. The southern and eastern parts of India were still further opened out under Alexander's successors, in consequence of the campaigns of the Seleucidae, and several journeys were undertaken by ambassadors, among which that of Megasthenes should be mentioned. The commercial expeditions of the Ptolemies resulted in fresh knowledge of the coasts of Arabia and East Africa.</p>
 <p>The first person to arrange the mass of geographical material, hitherto collected, into a really scientific system, was <ref type="cross" target="crosseratosthenes">Eratosthenes</ref> (q.v.) of Cyrené (about B.C. 276-175). He found his materials in the rich collections of the Alexandrian Library, Alexandria being then the central point of the commerce of the world. He was fully equipped for his task by his acquirements both in physical science and mathematics, and in history and philology. He endeavoured for the first time to estimate the earth's circumference by a measurement of degrees carried out over a space of fifteen degrees of latitude, though the imperfection of his method brought out too large a quantity. The name of Hipparchus of Nicaea (about B.C. 140) marks a considerable advance. He may be called the founder of mathematical geography, as he applied geographical length and breadth to determine the position of places on the earth's surface. He also superseded the rectangular and equidistant projection of parallels and meridians, hitherto used in maps, by a projection which, with few modifications, is identical with the one now in use. The parallels were represented by segments of a circle, the meridians by straight lines or curves, corresponding with the <figure id="fig.00724">
<head orig="The World according to Ptolemy.">The World according to Ptolemy.</head>
</figure> <cb /> portion of surface to be represented, drawn at distances corresponding to the actual distances on the surface of the globe. The estimate of the earth's circumference, which was accepted as correct down to the tenth century A.D., was that of Posidonius of Apamea (about B.C. 90). Taking as his basis the measurement of the shortest distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, he brought out the result as 4500 geographical miles, or too little by nearly one-sixth.</p>
 <p>Only fragments remain of the writings of these geographers, and others contemporary with them; but we possess the great work of Strabo of Amasia, finished about A.D. 20, the most important monument of descriptive geography and ethnology which has come down from Greek antiquity. Thanks to the Roman conquest, he was in a position to give a more accurate description of the West than his predecessors. Up to this time all that the Romans had done for geographical research was to open up Western Europe and Northern Africa to the Greek scientists. An immense service was rendered to science by Agrippa, under the direction of Augustus. He measured and indicated on a map the distance between the stations on the great military roads and along the coasts of the Roman Empire, thus contributing enormously to our knowledge of ancient topography, and laying a foundation for our maps. These data formed the basis of a new map of the world, which was first set up in Rome. Numerous copies were probably taken for the larger cities of the Empire, and smaller portable ones distributed among the military and the administrative officers. It is probably upon copies of this kind that the <title>Itineraria</title> and the <title>Tabula Peutingeriana</title> are based. See <ref type="cross" target="crossitineraria">Itineraria</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the first century A.D. much was added to geographical knowledge by the expeditions of the Romans into the interior of North Africa and the North of Europe. About A.D. 50 Apollonius of Antioch explored India, going beyond the Punjab and possibly as far as the Ganges. The most important literary works of the Romans on geography belong to this period. These are (1) the compendium of Pomponius Mela;</p>
 <p>(2) the geographical books of Pliny the Elder's great encyclopaedia (<title>Historia Naturalis</title>), an uncritical compilation, but the only representative we have of a number of lost works; and</p>
 <p>(3) the <title>Germania</title> of Tacitus, an essay mainly of an ethnographic character. The last great contribution made to geographical science in antiquity is the work of the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy (about A.D. 150). This consists mainly of lists of the places marked on the current maps which he makes his authorities, with their latitude and longitude. After Ptolemy, the geographical literature of the Greeks and Romans alike has nothing to show but compilations and extracts. Towards the end of the sixth century, Stephanus of Byzantium compiled a dictionary of geography, which is valuable for the quantity of information 
<pb n="725" /><cb /> taken from the older and lost writings which it embodies. The book of Pausanias (about A.D. 175) is valuable as bearing on the special topography of Greece. Cosmus, called Indicopleustes, wrote in the reign of Justinian a work called <title>Topographia Christiana</title>, giving an account of India. In it occurs the first mention by name of China.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γερμανία</foreign>). The Roman name for the territory bounded on the west by the river Rhenus (Rhine); on the east by the river Vistula and the Carpates (Carpathian) Mountains; on the south by the river Hister or Danubius (Danube); <figure id="fig.00726">
<head orig="Germania. (Kiepert.)">Germania. (Kiepert.)</head>
</figure> and on the north by the German Ocean. The northern and northeastern parts of Gallia Belgica were also called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Germania Prima</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Germania Secunda</hi> under the Empire, in contrast to which Germany Proper was styled <hi rend="SmallCaps">Germania Magna, Germania Barbăra</hi>, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Germania Transrhenāna</hi>.</p>
 <p>The Roman writers describe it as a dreary waste, covered for the most part with dense forests and morasses, and subject to heavy frosts and almost continuous cold, so that it is probable that <cb /> the clearing of the soil and the draining of the swamps have, since the days of the Roman Empire, considerably modified the climate of the country. The wooded mountains of Southern Germany were usually called Silvae by the Romans, the most famous being the Hercynia Silva or Hercynius Saltus, including the modern Schwarzwald or Black Forest, the Odenwald, the Thüringerwald, the Erzgebirge, the Harz, and the Riesengebirge (cf. <title>B. G.</title> vi. 24). The chief rivers of Germany were the Rhenus, Danubius, Vistula, Amisia (Ems), Visurgis (Weser), Albis (Elbe), and Viadus (Oder).</p>
 <p>The people whom the Romans called Germani were a branch of the Teutonic race, and are first mentioned in history in the fourth century B.C. The name is of uncertain etymology, being by some derived from a Keltic root, meaning “the shouters” (i. e. <foreign lang="greek">βοὴν ἀγαθοί</foreign>), by others from a second Keltic root meaning “neighbours,” and by others from the German <hi rend="italic">ger, gwer</hi>—i. e. <title>Heer</title>, =“the warriors.” Tacitus says (<title>Germania</title>, 2) that the name Germani was applied to the Tungri, the first German people to cross the Rhine, and appears to have been extended in its use by the Gauls to the whole race. The name Teutones was not the generic name for them in the time of the Romans, but is the base of the modern appellation <title>Deutsch;</title> the same with the Gothic <title>Thiuda</title>, “the people.” The modern French name for the Germans, <title>Allemands</title>, is derived from the name of the tribes, who formed a league on the upper Rhine under the appellation Alemanni or Alamanni (<title>alle Männer</title>).</p>
 <p>The Germans, though having no common name, regarded themselves as having a common descent from Mannus, the first man, son of the god Tuisco. 
<pb n="727" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Mannus was fabled to have had three sons, from whom sprang the three great German peoples— the Istaevones, Ingaevones, and the Herminones. The first of these are the people with whom the Romans were oftenest brought into contact, since they held both banks of the Rhine. Subdivisions of this race were the Ubii (near Cologne); the Usipetes, Tencteri, Sicambri, and Bructeri (from the Lippe to the Ruhr); the Chatti or Catti (Hesse), and the <ref type="cross" target="crossbatavi">Batavi</ref> (q.v.). Famous groups of the Ingaevones were the Frisii, the Chauci, and the Cherusci, along the North Sea and the banks of the Weser and the Ems. The most numerous of the three great divisions were the Herminones in Central Germany, extending to the east as far as the Vistula and the Carpathians. They included the powerful Suevi (to whom belonged the Marcomanni of Bohemia and the Semnones of Brandenburg), the Hermunduri of the Thüringerwald, the Lombardi or Langobardi at the mouth of the Elbe, the Vandali along the upper banks of the same river, the Heruli west of the Vistula, and the Quadi in what is now Moravia. See Böttger, <bibl default="NO"><title>Wohnsitze der Deutschen in dem von Tacitus beschriebenem Lande</title> (Stuttgart, 1877)</bibl>; and the accompanying map.</p>
 <p>The Germani were a stalwart, vigorous, and warlike race, with long, blond hair, fresh complexions, and blue eyes, living in wooden huts, which they often shared with their cattle, and engaging in the chase and in the fierce joys of warfare. Though violent and often cruel, they were not given to treachery, but were, as a rule, kindly and hospitable. Chastity was highly esteemed in women and was rarely lacking among them. The wife was wholly subject to the husband, but was treated with great consideration by him and consulted in the important affairs of life. The children were bred up to be hardy and enduring, the boys being taught at an early age the use of weapons. The majority of the people were free (<seg lang="la">ingenui</seg>), though there was a second class, described by Tacitus as <seg lang="la">liberti </seg> (<seg lang="la">leti</seg>, A. S. <hi rend="italic">laet</hi>), who had no political rights, and a third class composed of slaves (<seg lang="la">servi</seg>) who were either prisoners taken in war or those persons who had been sold for debt. Some tribes had kings, and there was a small body of nobles (<seg lang="la">nobiles</seg>). All freemen, however, were equal in respect to their political equality, the only difference between them being in the amount of the blood-money (A. S. <hi rend="italic">wergild</hi>) imposed as a fine for the killing of a king, a noble, or an ordinary <seg lang="la">ingenuus.</seg> The special privilege of the famous warriors of the tribe was to gather around them bands of young men emulous of the fame of their chieftains (<seg lang="la">principes</seg>). Such bands are called by Tacitus <seg lang="la">comitatus</seg>, and contain the germ of the later feudal system. The central governing body was the general assembly of the freemen in arms, they constituting the <seg lang="la">civitas</seg> or nation. The king was elected from the nobles, and did not succeed by inheritance. The divisions of the people were hardly territorial, but corresponded to the divisions of the armed host. The <seg lang="la">pagus</seg> and <seg lang="la">vicus</seg>, of which the Roman historians speak, were in reality divisions of the people. At the time when Caesar wrote, the Germans were in a state of transition, passing from the nomadic to an agricultural, settled condition. In Tacitus, they have entirely ceased to be nomadic, but have become attached to a definite territory.</p>
 <p>As to the religion of the Germans, the notices that have reached us are scanty. The chief deity <cb /> <figure id="fig.00727">
<head orig="Head of Ancient German. (Baumeister.)">Head of Ancient German. (Baumeister.)</head>
</figure> was Wotan, the same as the Scandinavian Odin, the god of the sky and the air, delighting in warfare and the chase, and represented as riding upon a white horse. Donar, the Scandinavian Thor, the god of thunder, was identified by the Romans with Hercules and afterwards with Iupiter. A third deity was Tyr or Ziu, the god of war, regarded by Tacitus as Mars. A goddess, Nerthus, was worshipped by the tribes along the Baltic, presiding over marriage, the household, the children, and the realm of the dead. She is the same as the Saxon Fria or Frigg, and the Frankish Holda. There were also three fatal sisters—two fair and beneficent, one dark and malign; besides giants, elves, and dwarfs. After death, the brave were believed to enter Walhalla. The priests were very influential among the Germans, offering sacrifices, and predicting the future from the neighing of horses and the flight of birds.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—The Germans first appear in history in the campaigns of the Cimbri and Teutones (B.C. 113), the latter of whom were undoubtedly a Germanic people. About fifty years afterwards, Ariovistus, a German chief, crossed the Rhine with a vast host of Germans and subdued a great part of Gaul; but he was defeated by Caesar with great slaughter in B.C. 58 and driven beyond the Rhine. Caesar twice crossed this river (in 55 and 53), but made no permanent conquest on the eastern bank. 
<pb n="728" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the reign of Augustus, his step-son Drusus carried on war in Germany with great success for four years (B.C. 12-9), and penetrated as far as the Elbe. In the course of his operations he cut a canal between the Yssel and the Rhine, and built no less than fifty forts along the latter river. On his death (B.C. 9), his brother Tiberius succeeded to the command; and under him the country between the Rhine and the Visurgis (Weser) was entirely subjugated, and seemed likely to become a Roman province. But in A.D. 9, the impolitic and tyrannical conduct of the Roman governor Quinctilius Varus provoked a general insurrection of the various German tribes, headed by <ref type="cross" target="crossarminius">Arminius</ref> (q.v.), the Cheruscan, who had himself been a soldier of Rome, and for his bravery had been made a knight.

</figure> and the Romans lost all their conquests east of the Rhine. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvarus">Varus</ref>.) The defeat of Varus was avenged by the successful campaigns of Germanicus (q. v.), who would probably have recovered the Roman dominions east of the river, had not the jealousy of Tiberius recalled him to Rome in A.D. 16. (See Knoke, <title>Die Kriegszüge des Germanicus in Deutschland</title> [Berlin, 1887].) From this time the Romans abandoned all further attempts to conquer Germany; but in consequence of the civil dissensions which broke out there soon after the departure of Tiberius, they were enabled to obtain peaceable possession of a large portion of Southwestern Germany between the Rhine and the Danube, to which they gave the name of the <ref type="cross" target="crossagri-decumates">Agri Decumates</ref> (q.v.). On the death of Nero, several of the tribes in Western Germany joined the Batavi in their insurrection against the Romans (A.D. 69- 71). Domitian and Trajan were forced to repel <cb /> the attacks of various German clans; but in the reign of Antoninus Pius, the Marcomanni, joined by other tribes, made a more formidable attack upon the Roman dominions, and even threatened the Empire with destruction. For thirteen years Marcus Aurelius with difficulty held in check the vast hordes of barbarians, who were striving to overwhelm the Roman lines of defence, which comprised powerful fortresses and a great wall, remains of which are still to be seen in Southern Germany. Around these forts sprang up towns, such as Vindobona (Vienna) and Iuvavum (Salzburg) in the east, and Moguntiacum (Mayence), Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), Argentoratum (Strassburg) and Bonna (Bonn) in the west. From this time the Romans were often called upon to defend the left bank of the Rhine against their dangerous neighbours, especially against the two powerful confederacies of the Alemanni and Franci; and in the fourth and fifth centuries the Germans obtained possession of some of the fairest provinces of the Empire.</p>
 <p>The influence of the Germans upon the Romans was great and continued to increase as time went on. Large numbers of the northern warriors enlisted in the legions even as early as the time of Iulius and Augustus Caesar, and gradually the whole army became permeated with German customs. Brunner even regards the history of the later Empire as the history of a continual conflict between the Germans and the Western Iberian elements; and has massed a great number of curious and striking facts to support his view. See his <title>Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte</title>, I. pp. 32-39 <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1887)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The Goths founded a great Germanic kingdom in the fourth century; the Burgundians conquered the whole of the valley of the Rhone; and the Vandals swept over Spain. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgothi">Gothi</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvandali">Vandali</ref>.) The West Goths crossed the Danube, penetrated into Italy, and under Alaric captured Rome itself. In the fifth century they conquered Southern Gaul and nearly the whole of Spain. In the invasion of the Huns under Attila, the Goths fought against him with the Romans, routing him at Châlons (A.D. 451), and soon after, Odoacer, chief of the Heruli, became master of Italy in 476.

 grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus, born B.C. 15. In A.D. 7 he became quaestor, five years before the legal age; and in the same year served with distinction in the war against the Pannonians and Dalmatians. In the year 11 he accompanied Tiberius in his campaigns against the Germans, who were flushed with the pride of their recent exploit in annihilating the Roman legions of Varus; but after a few desultory incursions he returned to Rome. In A.D. 14, however, he was put in command of eight legions stationed on the Rhine. He was first called upon to quell a formidable revolt of the Roman troops, who on the death of Augustus mutinied for increased pay and a shorter term of service. Tact and firmness, united to great affability of demeanor, on the part of Germanicus, made him successful in his task, and he became the idol of the army, though for a long time the disaffection smouldered and at times broke out into open rebellion. At last, however, a campaign against the enemy was begun. Germanicus crossed the Rhine and fell upon the hostile Marsi, laying waste their territory for fifty miles and sparing neither age nor sex. On his return he routed the formidable tribes of the Bructeri, the Tubantes, and the Usipetes, who tried to block his way. In A.D. 15 he attacked the Catti, took their chief town (Mattium), and treated the foe with the same unsparing severity. Soon afterwards, he took prisoner Thusnelda, the patriotic wife of the German hero Arminius. She was pregnant at the time, and her husband, infuriated at her capture, roused up not only his own people, the Cherusci, but all the neighbouring tribes, and hurled his forces upon the Romans. Near the Teutoburg Forest, where bleached the bones of Varus and his legions, Germanicus again met the <cb /> Germans. The conflict was long and doubtful. The Romans finally prevailed over the undisciplined valour of the barbarian hosts; yet so uncertain was the result that the victors decided to retire to the Rhine, which was done amid continuous fighting. In the next year, with a flotilla of 1000 vessels, he undertook another campaign on the lower Rhine. A great battle was fought on the plain of Idistavisus (near Hausberg), in which Arminius and his warriors were utterly routed. Arminius himself only escaped by disguising his person. It was on the occasion of this battle that eight eagles were seen hovering over the forest. “Come!” cried Germanicus to his troops, “Follow the birds of Rome, your own divinities!”—an exhortation that excited the courage of the legions to the highest pitch. Later, he once more devastated the country of the Marsi and the Catti.</p>
 <p>In A.D. 16, Tiberius, who was jealous of his growing fame, recalled him to Rome. The whole population poured out to meet him, and on the 26th of May he celebrated his triumph with great splendour, Thusnelda being led along the Via Sacra among the captives. Soon afterwards, Germanicus was placed over the Eastern Provinces with the highest <seg lang="la">imperium;</seg> but Tiberius set Cn. Piso in command of Syria, probably with secret instructions to thwart and embarrass Germanicus in every possible way. Piso's wife Plancina, also, a haughty and imperious woman, was incited by the ex-empress Livia, mother of Tiberius, to annoy, in innumerable petty ways, the noble wife of Germanicus, Agrippina, who had been his companion in all his campaigns, and whose influence had on one occasion even quelled a revolt of the soldiery ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 41</bibl>). As was to be expected, a bitter quarrel soon arose between Germanicus and Piso, and when Germanicus fell ill in A.D. 19, rumours that Piso had poisoned him were rife; though Germanicus himself attributed his illness to sorcery. His death took place on October 9th of the same year. <figure id="fig.00729.2">

 <p>Tacitus says that his body bore no marks of poison ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 2. 73" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>ii. 73</bibl>). Never had Rome more deeply lamented the death of an illustrious son. His liberal views, unostentatious demeanour, and kind heart, combined with courage and military genius, made the whole people his admirers. Unusual honours were granted to him on his death—a public tomb, a triumphal arch, and the insertion of his name in the Salian Hymns. He left six children, among whom were Gaius (Caligula), and Agrippina, the mother of Nero.</p>
 <p>Distinguished as much for culture as for military accomplishments, he was an orator and author as well as a general. Ovid, who dedicated to him the second edition of his <title>Fasti</title>, praises his poetry. His paraphrase of the <title>Phaenomena</title> of Aratus in 725 lines, and three fragments (246 lines) of a paraphrase of the same writer's <title>Prognostica</title>, still survive. They are remarkable for learning, command of metre, and a pleasing style. The <title>Phaenomena</title> is dedicated to Tiberius, and described by the author himself as the work of a beginner. These poems used erroneously to be attributed to Domitian, who did not, however, take the title of Germanicus until he was emperor. Three collections of scholia upon them, by no means without value, have also survived. The best edition of the <title>Aratea</title> of Germanicus, with the scholia, is that of Breysig <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1867)</bibl>.

<head orig="Gigantes">Gigantes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γίγαντες</foreign>). In Homer the Gigantes are a wild and gigantic race of aborigines, kinsmen of the gods, as are the Cyclopes and Phaeacians. With their king Eurymedon, they are destroyed for their wickedness. Hesiod makes them the sons of Gaea, sprung from the blood of the mutilated Uranus. Neither Hesiod nor Homer knew anything of their struggle with the gods (<title>Gigantomachia</title>), the story of which seems to be a reflection of the myth of the Titans and their contest with the gods, and to be associated with local legends. The two are often confused by later poets. The place of the contest was Phlegra, or the place of burning; and Phlegra was always localized in volcanic regions. In the earlier stories it is on the Macedonian peninsula of Pallené; and in later times on the Phlegraean plains in Campania between Cumae and Capua, or again at Tartessus in Spain. Led on by Alcyoneus and Porphyrion, they hurled rocks and burning trunks of trees against heaven. But the gods called Heracles to their assistance, a prophecy having warned them that they would be unable to destroy the giants without the aid of a mortal. Heracles slew not only Alcyoneus, but gave the others, whom the gods had struck down, their death-blow with his arrows. As Enceladus was flying, Athené threw the island of Sicily upon him. Polybotes was buried by Poseidon under the island of Nisyros, a piece of the island of Cos, which Poseidon had broken off with his trident, with all the giants who had fled there. Besides these, the following names are given among others: Agrius, Ephialtes, Pallas, Clytius, Eurytus, Hippolytus, Thoön.</p>
 <p>In the oldest works of art the Giants are represented in human form and equipped with armour and spears; but in course of time their attributes became terrific—awful faces, long hanging hair and beard, the skins of wild animals for garments, trunks of trees and clubs for weapons. In the latest representations, but not before, their bodies end in two scaly snakes instead of feet, as in the <figure id="fig.00731">

In the Gigantomachia of Pergamus, the grandest representation of the subject in antiquity, we find a great variety of forms; some quite human, others with snakes' feet and powerful wings, others with still bolder combinations of shape; some are naked, some clothed with skins, some fully armed, and others slinging stones.

<head orig="Gladiatōres">Gladiatores</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μονομάχοι</foreign>). Persons who fought with swords (<seg lang="la">gladii</seg>) in the circus, the forum, or in later times in the amphitheatre, for the amusement of the Roman people (Quintil. <title>Declam.</title> 302). <figure id="fig.00732">

</figure> They are said to have been first exhibited by the Etruscans, and to have had their origin from the custom of killing slaves and captives at the funeral pyres of the deceased (Tertull. <title>De Spectac.</title> 12; <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 10. 519" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>x. 519</bibl>). A show of gladiators was called <seg lang="la">munus</seg>, and the person who exhibited it, the <seg lang="la">editor, munerator</seg>, or <seg lang="la">dominus</seg>, who was honoured during the day of exhibition, if a private person, with the insignia of a magistrate ( <bibl n="Flor.  3. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.iii. 20</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Gladiators were first exhibited at Rome in B.C. 264, in the Forum Boarium, by Marcus and Decimus Brutus, at the funeral of their father (Val. Max. ii. 4, 17). They were at first confined to public funerals (<seg lang="la">bustuarius</seg>), but afterwards fought at the funerals of most persons of consequence, and even at those of women ( <title>Iul.</title> 26). Private persons sometimes left a sum of money in their will to pay the expenses of such an exhibition at their funerals ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 84" default="NO"> Sat., 84</bibl>). Combats of gladiators were also exhibited at entertainments by the degraded nobles of Campania (Sil. Ital. xi. 51), though not at Rome, and especially at public festivals by the aediles and other magistrates, who sometimes exhibited immense numbers with the view of pleasing the people. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaediles">Aediles</ref>.) Under the Empire the passion of the Romans for this amusement rose to its greatest height, and the number of gladiators who fought on some occasions appears almost incredible. After Trajan's triumph over the Dacians, there were more than 10,000 exhibited (Dio Cass. lxviii. 15).</p>
 <p>Gladiators consisted either of captives, slaves, and condemned malefactors, or of freeborn citizens who fought voluntarily. Of those who were condemned, some were said to be condemned <seg lang="la">ad gladium</seg>, in which case they were obliged to be killed at least within a year; and others <seg lang="la">ad ludum</seg>, who might obtain their discharge at the end of three years. Freemen who be <cb /> came gladiators for hire were called <seg lang="la">auctorati</seg>, and their hire <seg lang="la">auctoramentum</seg> or <seg lang="la">gladiatorium</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>7</bibl>). They also took an oath on entering upon the service, similar to that which is preserved by Petronius (117): <title>In verba Eumolpi sacramentum iuravimus, uri, vinciri, verberari, ferroque necari, et quicquid aliud Eumolpus iussisset, tamquam legitimi gladiatores, domino corpora animasque religiosissime addicimus.</title> Even under the Republic, freeborn citizens fought as gladiators (<bibl n="Liv.  28. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxviii. 21</bibl>), but they appear to have belonged only to the lower orders, and the profession was considered degrading (cf. Mommsen, <title>C. I. L.</title> i. 1418), though to some it had many attractions. Under the Empire, however, both knights and senators fought in the arena ( <title>Iul.</title> 39; <bibl n="Cic. Aug. 43" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>43</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 12" default="NO"> <title>Ner.</title>12</bibl>), and even women ( <bibl n="Suet. Dom. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Dom.</title>4</bibl>); a practice which was at length forbidden in the time of Severus (Dio Cass. lxxv. 16).</p>
 <p>Gladiators were kept in schools (<seg lang="la">ludi</seg>), where they were trained by persons called <seg lang="la">lanistae.</seg> The whole body of gladiators under one <seg lang="la">lanista</seg> was frequently called <seg lang="la">familia.</seg> They sometimes were the property of the <seg lang="la">lanistae</seg>, who let them out to persons who wished to exhibit a show of gladiators; but at other times belonged to citizens, who kept them for the purpose of exhibition, and engaged <seg lang="la">lanistae</seg> to instruct them. Thus <ref type="cross" target="crossspartacus">Spartacus</ref> (q.v.) belonged to the school of Lentulus at Capua ( <bibl n="Flor.  3. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Flor.iii. 8</bibl>), and Caesar had one at the same place. Domitian built four <seg lang="la">ludi</seg> at Rome, and there were several others in Italy and the provinces. The number of gladiators which any citizen might keep was limited by the Senate in B.C. 68 ( <title>Iul.</title> 10), but Caligula did away with the restriction (Dio Cass. lix. 14). The superintendence of the <seg lang="la">ludi</seg>, which belonged to the emperors, was intrusted to a person of high rank, called <seg lang="la">curator</seg> or <seg lang="la">procurator.</seg> The arrangements of a <seg lang="la">ludus gladiatorius</seg> are now known to us from one excavated at Pompeii. See illustration on next page.</p>
 <p>The gladiators fought in these schools with wooden swords, called <seg lang="la">rudes</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 32. 54" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>xxxii. 54</bibl>). Great attention was paid to their diet, in order to increase the strength of their bodies, and they were fed with nourishing food, called <seg lang="la">gladiatoria sagina.</seg></p>
 <p>Gladiators were sometimes exhibited at the funeral pyre, and sometimes in the forum, but more <figure id="fig.00732.2">

<pb n="733" /><cb />
 frequently in the amphitheatre. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</ref>.) The person who was to exhibit a show of gladiators published some days before the exhibition bills (<seg lang="la">libelli</seg>), containing the number and sometimes the names of those who were to fight; e. g. at Pompeii we have (<title>C. I. L.</title> iv. 1189): <hi rend="SmallCaps">A. Suettii Certi aedilis familia gladiatoria pugnabit Pompeiis prid. Kal. Iun. venatio et vela erunt;</hi> and similar notices. When the day came, <figure id="fig.00733">

</figure> they were led along the arena in procession, and matched by pairs; and their swords were examined by the <seg lang="la">editor</seg> to see if they were sufficiently sharp ( <bibl n="Suet. Tit. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tit.</title>9</bibl>). At first there was a kind of sham battle, called <seg lang="la">praelusio</seg>, in which they fought with wooden swords, or the like ( <title>Epist.</title> 117), and afterwards at the sound of the trumpet the real battle began. When a gladiator was wounded, the people called out “Habet!” or “Hoc habet!” and the one who was vanquished lowered his arms in token of submission. His fate, however, depended upon the people, who turned up their thumbs if they wished him to be killed ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 18</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 66</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  3. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 36</bibl>), and ordered him to receive the sword (<seg lang="la">ferrum recipere</seg>), which gladiators usually did with the greatest firmness. A relief has been discovered at Cacillargues, showing a combat between a Samnite and a <seg lang="la">retiarius</seg>, with four spectators, one of whom, a woman, is holding up her thumbs. There is no clear evidence that the wish that mercy should be shown was expressed by pressing down the thumbs (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 28.  25" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxviii. 25</bibl> is barely to the point); this was indicated rather by waving handkerchiefs ( <bibl n="Mart.  12. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 7</bibl>). If the life of a vanquished gladiator was spared, he obtained his discharge for that day, which was called <seg lang="la">missio</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  12. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 7</bibl>); and hence in an exhibition of gladiators <seg lang="la">sine missione</seg>, the lives of the conquered were never spared. This kind of exhibition, however, was forbidden by Augustus ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Palms were usually given to the victorious gladiators, and hence a gladiator who had frequently conquered is called <seg lang="la">plurimarum palmarum gladiator</seg> ( <title>Pro Rosc. Amer.</title> vi. 17); money also was <cb /> sometimes given ( <title>Claud.</title> 21). Old gladiators, and sometimes those who had only fought for a short time, were discharged from the service by the <seg lang="la">editor</seg> at the request of the people, who presented each of them with a rudis or wooden sword; whence those who were discharged were called <seg lang="la">rudiarii</seg> ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>ii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Phil., 74</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 2</bibl>). If a person was free before he entered the ludus, he became on his discharge free again; and if he had been a slave, he returned to the same condition again, unless he received the cap of freedom (<seg lang="la">pilleus</seg>). A man, however, who had been a gladiator, was always considered to have disgraced himself, and consequently it appears that he could not obtain the equestrian rank even if he afterwards acquired sufficient property to entitle him to it; and a slave who had been sent into a <seg lang="la">ludus</seg> and there manumitted, merely acquired the status of a <seg lang="la">peregrinus dediticius.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossdediticii">Dediticii</ref>.</p>
 <p>Shows of gladiators were abolished by Constantine, but appear notwithstanding to have been generally exhibited till the time of Honorius, by whom they were finally suppressed.</p>
 <p>Gladiators were divided into different classes, according to their arms and different mode of fighting, or other circumstances. The names of the most important of these classes are given in alphabetical order:</p>
 <p><title>Andabatae</title> ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> vii. 10) wore helmets without any aperture for the eyes, so that they were obliged to fight blindfold, and thus excited the mirth of the spectators. They are generally believed to have fought on horseback, but this is denied by Orelli (<title>Inscr.</title> 2577) and Friedländer; the name cannot be derived from <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβάτης</foreign>. It is perhaps Keltic, with the meaning “blind-fighter” (Whitley Stokes, in <title>Academy</title>, Feb. 9, 1889). <figure id="fig.00733.2">
<head orig="Andabatae. (From the Amphitheatre, Pompeii.)">Andabatae. (From the Amphitheatre, Pompeii.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p><title>Bustuarii</title> were those who fought on the funeral pyre. See illustration, p. 732.</p>
 <p><title>Catervarii</title> was the name given to gladiators when they did not fight in pairs, but when several fought together ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>Dimachaeri</title> appear to have been so called, because they fought with two swords ( <bibl n="Artemid.  2. 32" default="NO">Artemid.ii. 32</bibl>; Orelli, <title>Inscr.</title> 2584).</p>
 <p><title>Equites</title> were those who fought on horseback (Orelli, <title>Inscr.</title> 2569, 2577). 
<pb n="734" /><cb /></p>
 <p><title>Essedarii</title> fought from chariots (<seg lang="la">esseda</seg>), like the Gauls and Britons. They are frequently mentioned in inscriptions (Orelli, 2566, 2584, etc.; cf. <bibl n="Petron.  45" default="NO">Petron.45</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>Fiscales</title> were those under the Empire who were trained and supported from the <seg lang="la">fiscus</seg> (Capitol. <title>Gord.</title> 33).</p>
 <p><title>Hoplomachi</title> appear to have been those who fought in a complete suit of armour ( <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>35</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 74</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>Laquearii</title> were those who used a noose (<seg lang="la">laqueus</seg>) to catch their adversaries ( <bibl n="Isid.  18. 56" default="NO">Isid.xviii. 56</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>Meridiani</title> were those who fought in the middle of the day, after combats with wild beasts had taken place in the morning. These gladiators were very lightly armed ( <title>Claud.</title> 34).</p>
 <p><title>Myrmillones</title> are said to have been so called from their having the image of a fish (<hi rend="italic">mormyr</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">μορμύρος</foreign>) on their helmets ( Fest. s. v. <title>Retiarii</title>). Their arms were like those of the Gauls, and they did not differ much from the kind called Galli. They were usually matched with the <seg lang="la">retiarii</seg> or Thracians ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 3. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>iii. 12</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Phil., 31</bibl>; vii. 6<bibl n="Cic.

 <p><title>Ordinarii</title> was the name applied to all the regular gladiators who fought in pairs in the ordinary way ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>, <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>26</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>Postulaticii</title> were such as were demanded by the people from the <seg lang="la">editor</seg>, in addition to those who were exhibited ( <title>Epist.</title> 7).</p>
 <p><title>Provocatores</title> fought with the Samnites ( <title>Pro Sest.</title> 64. 134), but we do not know anything respecting them except their name.</p>
 <p><title>Retiarii</title> carried only a three-pointed lance, called <seg lang="la">tridens</seg> or <seg lang="la">fuscina</seg>, a dagger (Val. Max. i. 7, 8), and a net (<seg lang="la">rete</seg>), which they endeavoured to throw over their adversaries, and then to attack them with the fuscina while they were entangled. The <seg lang="la">reti-</seg> <figure id="fig.00734">

</figure> <cb /> <hi rend="italic">arius</hi> was dressed in a short tunic, and wore nothing on his head. If he missed his aim in throwing the net, he betook himself to flight, and endeavoured to prepare his net for a second cast, while his adversary followed him round the arena in order to kill him before he could make a second attempt. His adversary was usually a <seg lang="la">secutor</seg> or a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo</hi> ( <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>30</bibl>, <title>Claud.</title> 34; Orelli, 2578). In the following illustration a combat is represented between a <seg lang="la">retiarius</seg> and a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo;</hi> the former <figure id="fig.00734.2">
<head orig="Myrmillo and Retiarius. (Mosaic in the Library at Madrid.)">Borghese Gladiator (?) of Agasias. (Louvre.)</head>
</figure> has thrown his net over the head of the latter, and is proceeding to attack him with the <seg lang="la">fuscina.</seg> The <seg lang="la">lanista</seg> stands behind the <seg lang="la">retiarius.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Samnites</title> were so called because they were armed in the same way as that people, with a helmet with a high crest ( <bibl n="Juv.  6. 256" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 256</bibl>), and were particularly distinguished by the oblong <seg lang="la">scutum.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Secutores</title> are supposed by most writers to be so called because the <seg lang="la">secutor</seg> in his combat with the <seg lang="la">retiarius</seg> pursued the latter when he failed in securing him by his net. Other writers think that they were the same as the <seg lang="la">suppositicii</seg>, mentioned by Martial (v. 24), who were gladiators substituted in the place of those who were wearied or were killed ( <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>30</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  6. 108" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.vi. 108</bibl>, with the Schol. viii. 210). If the old reading in a letter of Cicero's (<title>Ad Att.</title> vii. 14) is correct, Iulius Caesar had no less than 600 <seg lang="la">secutores</seg> in his <seg lang="la">ludus</seg> at Capua; but we probably ought to read <seg lang="la">scutorum</seg> instead of <seg lang="la">secutorum.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Suppositicii.</title> See <title>Secutores.</title></p>
 <p><title>Thraces</title> or <title>Thraeces</title> were armed, like the Thracians, with a round shield or buckler ( Fest. s. v. <title>Thraeces</title>), and a short curved sword or dagger (<seg lang="la">sica</seg>,  <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>32</bibl>), which is called <seg lang="la">falx supina</seg> by Juvenal (viii. 201), and wore greaves on both legs. They were usually matched, as already stated, with the <hi rend="italic">myrmillones.</hi></p>
 <p><title>Velites</title> had light spears (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Ib. 45" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ib.</title>45</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Paintings of gladiatorial combats, as well as of the other sports of the amphitheatre, were favourite subjects with the Roman artists (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  52" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 52</bibl>). Several statues of gladiators have come down to us, which are highly admired as works of 
<pb n="735" /><cb />
 art; of these, the most celebrated is the athlete by Agasias of the Borghese Collection, now in the Museum of the Louvre, and the Dying Gladiator, in the Capitoline Museum. The latter, which inspired the famous stanza in <title>Childe Harold</title>, is now, however, regarded as a wounded Gaul. Gladiatorial combats are represented in the bas-reliefs on the tomb of Scaurus at Pompeii, and illustrate in many particulars the brief account which has been given in this article of the several classes of gladiators. These bas-reliefs are represented in the following illustrations from Mazois ( <bibl n="D. H. Pomp. 1." default="NO"> <title>Pomp.</title>i.</bibl> pl. 32; and <figure id="fig.00735">
<head orig="Gladiators.">Gladiators.</head>
</figure> Overbeck, <title>Pompeii</title>, p. 165). The figures are made of stucco, and appear to have been moulded separately, and attached to the plaster by pegs of bronze or iron. In various parts of the frieze are written the name of the person to whom the gladiators belonged, and also the names of the gladiators themselves, and the number of their victories. The first pair of gladiators on the left hand represents an equestrian combat. Both wear helmets with visors, which cover the whole face, and are armed with spears and round bucklers. In the second pair the gladiator on the left has been wounded; he has let fall his shield, and is imploring the mercy of the people by raising his hands towards them. His antagonist stands behind him waiting the signal of the people. Like all the other gladiators represented on the frieze, they wear the <seg lang="la">subligaculum</seg> or short apron tied above the hips. The one on the left appears to be a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo</hi>, and the one on the right, with an oblong shield (<seg lang="la">scutum</seg>), a Samnite. The third pair consists of a Thracian and a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo</hi>, or Samnite, the latter of whom is defeated. The fourth group consists of four figures; two are <seg lang="la">secutores</seg> and two <seg lang="la">retiarii.</seg> The <seg lang="la">secutor</seg> on his knee appears to have been defeated by the <seg lang="la">retiarius</seg> behind him; but as the <seg lang="la">fuscina</seg> is not adapted for producing certain death, the other <seg lang="la">secutor</seg> is called upon to do it. The <seg lang="la">retiarius</seg> in the distance is probably destined to fight in his turn with the surviving <seg lang="la">secutor.</seg> The last group consists of a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo</hi> and a Samnite; the latter is defeated.</p>
 <p>In the second illustration two combats are represented. In the first a Samnite has been conquered by a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo;</hi> the former is holding up <cb /> his hand to the people to implore mercy, while the latter apparently wishes to become his enemy's executioner before receiving the signal from the people; but the <seg lang="la">lanista</seg> holds him back. In the other combat a <hi rend="italic">myrmillo</hi> is mortally wounded by a Samnite. It will be observed that the right arm of every figure is protected by rings of armour, which the left does not require on account of the shield.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ξίφος</foreign>; poet. <foreign lang="greek">ἄορ, φάσγανον</foreign>). A sword, by the Latin poets called <seg lang="la">ensis.</seg> The ancient sword had generally a straight, two-edged blade (<foreign lang="greek">ἄμφηκες</foreign>), rather broad, and of nearly equal width from hilt to point. Gladiators, however, used a sword which was curved like a scimitar. In times of the remotest antiquity swords were made of bronze, but afterwards of iron. The Greeks and Romans wore them on the left side, so as to draw them out of the sheath (<foreign lang="greek">κόλεος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">vagina</seg>) by passing the right hand in front of the body to take hold of the hilt with the thumb next to the blade. Hence Aeschylus <figure id="fig.00735.2">

<pb n="736" /><cb /> distinguishes the army of Xerxes by the denomination of <foreign lang="greek">μαχαιροφόρον ἔθνος</foreign>, alluding to the obvious difference in their appearance in consequence of the use of the <seg lang="la">acinaces</seg> instead of the sword. See <ref type="cross" target="crossacinaces">Acinaces</ref>.</p>
 <p>The early Greeks used a very short sword. Iphicrates, who made various improvements in armour about B.C. 400, doubled its length, so that an iron sword found in a tomb at Athens, and represented by Dodwell, was two feet five inches long, including the handle, which was also of iron. The Roman sword, as was the case also with their other offensive weapons, was larger, heavier, and more formidable than the Greek. Its length gave occasion to the joke of Lentulus upon his son-in-law, who was of very low stature, “Who tied my sonin-law to his sword?” To this Roman sword the Greeks applied the term <foreign lang="greek">σπάθη</foreign>, which was the name of a piece of wood of the same form used in weaving. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstela">Tela</ref>.) The ancient British sword was still larger than the Roman. The principal ornamentation of the sword was bestowed upon the hilt. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapulus">Capulus</ref>. <figure id="fig.00736">

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γλαῦκος</foreign>). (1) A sea deity, probably only another form of Poseidon, whose son he is, according to some accounts. Like the marine gods in general, he had the gift of prophecy; and we find him appearing to the Argonauts (<bibl n="A. R. 1.1310" default="NO" valid="yes">Apoll. Rh. i. 1310</bibl> foll.), and to Menelaüs (Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 356" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orest.</title>356</bibl> foll.), and telling them what had happened, or what was to happen. In later times sailors were continually making reports of his soothsaying (Pausan. ix. 22). Some said that he dwelt with the Nereides at Delos, where he gave responses to all who sought them. According to others, he visited each year all the isles and coasts, with a train of monsters of the deep (<foreign lang="greek">κήτεα</foreign>), and, unseen, foretold in the Aeolic dialect all kinds of evil. The fishermen watched for his approach, and endeavoured by fastings, prayer, and fumigations to avert the ruin with which his prophecy menaced the fruits and cattle. At times he was seen among the waves, and his body appeared covered with mussels, seaweed, and stones. He was heard evermore to lament his fate in not being able to die ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 10. 611" default="NO">Plato <title>Rep.</title>x. 611</bibl>). This last circumstance refers to the common legendary history of Glaucus. He was a fisherman, it is said (Pausan. l. c.; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 13. 904" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xiii. 904</bibl> foll.), of Anthedon, in Boeotia. Observing one day the fish which he had caught and thrown on the grass to bite it, and then to jump into the sea, his curiosity incited him to taste it also. Immediately on his doing so he followed their example, and thus became a sea-god. Another account made him to have obtained his immortality by tasting the grass, which had revived a hare he had run down in Aetolia. He was also said to have built and steered the Argo, and to have been made a god of the sea by Zeus during the voyage. An account of the story of his love for Scylla will be found under <ref type="cross" target="crossscylla">Scylla</ref>.

 <p>(3) A son of Minos and Pasiphaë, who, when a child, pursuing a mouse, fell into a vessel of honey and was smothered. His father, ignorant of his fate, consulted the oracle to know where he was, and received for answer that there was a three-coloured cow in his herd, and that he who could best tell what she was like could restore his son to life. The soothsayers were all assembled, and Polyidus, the son of Coiranus, said that her colour was that of the berry of the briar, green, red, and, lastly, black. Minos thereupon desired him to find his son; and Polyidus, by his skill in divination, discovered where he was. Minos then ordered him to restore him to life; and, on his declaring his incapacity so to do, shut him up in a chamber with the body of his child. While here, the soothsayer saw a serpent approach the body, and he struck and killed it. Another immediately appeared, and seeing the first one dead, retired, and came back soon after with a plant in its mouth, and laid it on the dead one, which instantly came to life. Polyidus, by employing the same herb, recovered the child. Minos, before he let him depart, insisted on his communicating his art to Glaucus. He did so, but as he was taking leave he desired his pupil to spit into his mouth. Glaucus obeyed, and lost the recollection of all he had learned ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3. 3. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii. 3. 1</bibl>). Hyginus makes him to have been restored to life by Aesculapius (<title>Poet. Astron.</title> ii. 14).</p>
 <p>(4) The grandson of Bellerophontes, and son of Hippolochus, prince of the Lycians. With his kinsman Sarpedon, he was leader of the Lycian auxiliaries of Priam, and met Diomedes in the <seg lang="la">mêlée.</seg> The two chieftains recognized each other as friends and guests of their grandfather Bellerophontes and Oeneus, and exchanged armour, Glaucus parting with his golden suit for the brazen arms of Diomedes. When the Greek intrenchments were stormed, Glaucus had reached the top of the wall when he was put to flight by an arrow shot by Teucer. He protected Hector when wounded by Achilles; with Apollo's aid he avenged Sarpedon, and took a prominent part in the struggle for the body of Patroclus. He finally met his death at the hand of Aias.

<head orig="Glossa">Glossa</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσα</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Glossēma</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γλώσσημα</foreign>). In the language of text-criticism, a “gloss.” The word underwent a gradual development of meaning, which may be described with brevity. By the earliest Greek commentators and editors of texts, <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσα</foreign> denoted any word in an author that required definition or explanation. Such were (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) archaisms; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</foreign> and newly-coined words; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) provincialisms; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) barbarisms; and (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) technical terms (cf.  <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 21. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Poet.</title>21. 4</bibl>-6; <bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 3. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title>iii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Rhet. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> Rhet., 2</bibl>; <bibl n="Quint.  1. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.i. 8</bibl>). In editing or transcribing a text it was usual for the editor or transcriber to define the <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσα</foreign> by writing opposite to it in the margin the more familiar synonym (<foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα κύριον</foreign>). The term <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσα</foreign> soon came to be applied to the pair of words—the word in the text and the <cb /> definition in the margin—the two being regarded as constituting a single whole. Finally, the explanation alone was called a <foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσα</foreign>. With these glosses begins the history of lexicography; for collections of them began to be made, and published separately as <seg lang="la">glossaria</seg> or glossaries. Such was the compilation of the elegiac poet Philetas of Cos, whose collection was the first attempt at an Homeric glossary (cf. Susemihl, <title>Geschichte d. griech. Lit. in d. alexandr. Zeit</title>, i. p. 174 foll.). We know of glosses as early as the fifth century B.C., for Democritus of Abdera is said to have written a treatise <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ὁμήρον ἢ Ὀρθοεπέιης καὶ Γλωσσάων</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslexicon">Lexicon</ref>.) Glosses soon ceased to be purely lexical, and from definitions became commentary— geographical, historical, philosophical, or philological—according to the taste or purpose of the glossographer. When these explanatory glosses are fairly brief, they are usually styled <hi rend="italic">scholia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σχόλια</foreign>); when long, they constitute <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομνήματα</foreign> or regular commentaries, such as the Alexandrians wrote. See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>.</p>
 <p>The principal glossographers among the Greeks were Philetas (about B.C. 290), Zenodotus of Ephesus (about B.C. 280), compiler of <foreign lang="greek">Γλῶσσαι Ὁμηρικαί</foreign>; Aristophanes of Byzantium (B.C. 200), whose glosses are partly preserved by Pollux; Diodorus, Artemidorus, Nicander of Colophon, Aristarchus of Samothrace, Crates of Mallos, Zenodotus of Mallos, Didymus Chalcenteros, Apollonius Sophista (about B.C. 20), Neoptolemus, known distinctively as <foreign lang="greek">ὁ γλωσσογράφος</foreign>; Apion (at Rome under Claudius), Erotion, Pamphilus, Aelius Herodianus, Pollux, Phrynichus in the second century A.D., Ammonius of Alexandria in the fourth century, the famous <ref type="cross" target="crosshesychius">Hesychius</ref> (q.v.), Photius, Suidas, Zonaras, and the author of the <title>Etymologicum Magnum</title> (q. v.). Of the Romans, Aurelius Opilius, Aelius Stilo, Varro, Verrius Flaccus, and Festus deserve especial mention. Of technical glosses, those on the legal compilations of Justinian are very important. Of these, two famous compilers were Cyrillus and Philoxenus.</p>

<head orig="Gnostĭci">Gnostici</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γνοστικοί</foreign>). A religious sect which flourished in the first century of the Christian era. In the New Testament, <foreign lang="greek">γνῶσις</foreign> denotes the profound appreciation of Christian truth; with the Gnostics it means a sort of transcendental and mystic understanding, which saw and knew the allegories and subtleties which they professed to find in the sacred writings. They claimed a kinship between all the religions of the world, and asserted their possession of special traditions from certain of Christ's disciples, and the gift of prophecy. The sources of Gnosticism were three —Greek idealism, Oriental pantheism, and Christian revelation, and it was always a heresy of the learned rather than of the masses whom its subtleties repelled. The four points upon which nearly all the Gnostics agreed were as follows: (1) God is incomprehensible;</p>
 <p>(2) Matter is eternal and antagonistic to God in that it conditions and limits the divine efficiency;</p>
 <p>(3) Creation is the work of a Demiurgus, either subordinate to God or perhaps actually opposed to him;</p>
 <p>(4) The human nature of Christ was only a deception. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaeon">Aeon</ref>.</p>
 <p>Gnosticism reached its highest point A.D. 150, after which it rapidly declined. Its importance is to be found in the fact that its arbitrary treatment of the Scriptures forced the Church to a more thorough study of the historical tradition, and to establish the principle that nothing is to be regarded as true Christianity which is not shown to be derived from Christ and his apostles.

He also cultivated literature, and wrote several poems, among others one in which he celebrated the virtues of the two Antonines. Being intrusted with the government of several provinces, he conducted himself in such a manner as to <figure id="fig.00738.3">
<head orig="The Elder Gordianus. (Capitoline Museum.)">The Elder Gordianus. (Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure> gain universal approbation. He was proconsul of Africa in A.D. 237. When an insurrection broke out in that province against Maximinus, on account of his exactions, and the insurgents saluted Gordianus as emperor, he prayed earnestly to be excused, on account of his age, being then past eighty, and to be allowed to die in peace; but, the insurgents 
<pb n="739" /><cb /> threatening to kill him if he refused, he accepted the perilous dignity, naming his son Gordianus as his colleague, and both made their solemn entry into Carthage amid universal applause. The Senate cheerfully confirmed the election, proclaiming the two Gordiani as emperors, and declaring Maximinus and his son to be the enemies of their country. Meantime, however, Capellianus, governor of Mauritania, collected troops in favour of Maximinus, and marched against Carthage. The younger Gordianus came out to oppose him, but was defeated and killed, and his aged father, on learning the sad tidings, strangled himself. Their reign had not lasted two months altogether, yet they were greatly regretted, on account of their personal qualities.</p>

Alexander Severus advanced him subsequently to the consulship. He afterwards passed into Africa as lieutenant to his father, and, when the latter was elevated to the throne, shared that dignity with him. But, after a reign of not quite two months, he fell in battle, at the age of forty-six, against Capellianus, a partisan of Maximinus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgordianus">Gordianus</ref>, 1.)</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Antonīnus Pius</hi>, grandson, on the mother's side, of the elder Gordianus, and nephew of Gordianus the younger, was twelve years of age when he was proclaimed Caesar by general acclamation of the people of Rome, after the news had arrived of the death of the two Gordiani in Africa. The Senate named him colleague of the two new emperors Maximus and Balbinus, but in the following year (A.D. 238) a mutiny of the Praetorians took place at Rome, Balbinus and Maximus were murdered, and the boy Gordianus was proclaimed emperor. His disposition was kind and amiable, but at the beginning of his reign he trusted to the insinuations of a certain Maurus and other freedmen of the palace, who abused his confidence, and committed many acts of injustice. In the second year of his reign a revolt broke out in Africa, where a certain Sabinianus was proclaimed emperor, but the insurrection was soon put down by the governor of Mauritania. In the following year Gordianus, being consul with Claudius Pompeianus, married Furia Sabina Tranquillina, daughter of Misitheus, a man of the greatest personal merit. Misitheus disclosed to Gordianus the disgraceful conduct of Maurus and his friends, who were immediately deprived of their offices and driven away from court. From that moment Gordianus placed implicit trust in his father-in-law, on whom the Senate conferred the title of “Guardian of the Republic.” In the next year, news came to Rome that the Persians under Sapor had invaded Mesopotamia, had occupied Nisibis and Carrhae, entered Syria, and, according to Capitolinus, had taken Gordianus opened the temple of Ianus, according to an ancient custom which had been long disused, and, setting out from Rome at the head of a fine army, marched through Illyricum and Moesia, where he defeated the Goths and Sarmatians, and drove them beyond the Danube. Gordianus presently crossed the Hellespont, and proceeded into Syria, delivered Antioch, defeated the Persians in several battles, retook Nisibis and <cb /> Carrhae, and drove Sapor back to his own dominions. The Senate voted him a triumph. In the year after, A.D. 244, Gordianus advanced into Persian territory, and defeated Sapor on the banks of the Chaboras; but while he was preparing to pursue him, Philippus, an officer in the Guards, who had contrived to spread discontent among the soldiers by attributing their privations to the inexperience of a boyish emperor, was proclaimed by the army his colleague in the Empire. Gordianus consented, but soon after was murdered by Philippus. Gordianus was about twenty years old when he died. His body, according to Eutropius, was carried to Rome, and he was numbered among the gods (Herodian, vii. 10 foll.; viii. 6 foll.; Eutrop. ix. 2).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γοργίας</foreign>). (1) A Greek sophist and rhetorician, known as “the Nihilist,” a native of Leontini in Sicily. In B.C. 427, when already advanced in years, he came to Athens on an embassy from his native city, to implore aid against the Syracusans. The finished style of his speaking excited general admiration. He was successful in the object of his mission, and immediately returned home; but he soon came back to Athens, which he made his headquarters, travelling through Greece, like the other sophists, and winning much popularity and profit from a large number of disciples. He survived Socrates, who died in 399, and ended his days at Larissa in Thessaly in his hundred and fifth year.</p>
 <p>His philosophy was a nihilistic system, which is summed up in three propositions: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Nothing exists; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) If anything existed, it could not be known; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) If anything did exist, and could be 
<pb n="740" /><cb />
 known, it could not be communicated. He declined to assume the name of sophist, preferring that of rhetorician. He professed not to teach virtue, but the art of persnasion; in other words, to give his disciples such absolute readiness in speaking, that they should be able to convince their hearers independently of any knowledge of the subject. He did not found his instruction on any definite rhetorical system, but gave his pupils standard passages of literature to learn by heart and imitate, practising them in the application of rhetorical figures. He appeared in person, on various occasions, at Delphi, Olympia, and Athens, with model speeches which he afterwards published. It must be remembered that it was Gorgias who transplanted rhetoric to Greece, and who helped to diffuse the Attic dialect as the literary language of prose. There remain two works ascribed to him, but not genuine—the so-called <title>Apology of Palamedes</title>, and the <title>Encomium on Helen.</title> See the article by Baumstark in the <title>Rheinisches Museum</title> for 1860, pp. 624-626; and Blass, <title>Attische Beredsamkeit</title>, pp. 44-72.</p>

<head orig="Gorgo">Gorgo</head>

 <p>or Gorgon (<foreign lang="greek">Γοργώ</foreign>).</p>
 <p> (1) The wife of Leonidas, king of Sparta. A fine repartee of hers is given by Plutarch. When a woman, a stranger, observed to her, “You Spartan women are the only ones that rule men,” she replied, “True, for we are the only ones that give birth to men” ( <title>Lacon. Apophth.</title>).</p>
 <p> (2) (<foreign lang="greek">Γοργώ</foreign>). The capital of the Chorasmii in Bactriana. It is supposed to correspond to the modern Urghenz.</p>
 <p> (3) (<foreign lang="greek">Γοργώ</foreign>). Homer makes mention of the terrible head of the Gorgon, a formidable monster (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.633" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Odyss.</title> xi. 633</bibl>). This head is a terror in Hades, and in the aegis of Zeus. Hesiod speaks of three Gorgons: Stheno (Valeria, the mighty), Euryalé (Lativolva, the wide-wandering), and Medusa (Guberna, the ruler). They are the daughters of the aged sea-god Phorcys and Ceto, and sisters of the Graiae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgraeae">Graiae</ref>.) They dwell on the farthest shore of Ocean, in the neighbourhood of Night and of the Hesperides. They are awful beings, with hair and girdles of snakes, whose look turns the beholder to stone. They are also often represented with golden wings, brazen claws, and enormous teeth. Medusa is mortal, but the other two immortal. When Perseus cut off Medusa's head, Chrysaor and the winged horse Pegasus, with whom she was with child by Poseidon, sprang forth from the streaming blood. The head was given by Perseus to Athené, who set it in her shield. Heracles received a lock of the hair from Athené as a present. When endeavouring to persuade Cephalus of Tegea to take part in his expedition against Hippocoön of Sparta, the king represented that he feared an attack from his enemies the Argives in Heracles's absence. Heracles accordingly gave to Steropé, the daughter of Cephalus, the lock of Medusa's hair in a brazen urn, bidding her, <cb /> <figure id="fig.00740">
<head orig="Rondanini Medusa. (Glyptothek, Munich.)">Rondanini Medusa. (Glyptothek, Munich.)</head>
</figure> in case the enemy approached, to avert her head and hold it three times over the walls, for the mere aspect of it would turn the enemy to flight.</p>
 <p>In consequence of the belief in this power of the Gorgon 's head, or Gorgoneion, to paralyze and terrify an enemy, the Greeks carved images of it in its most terrifying forms, not only on armour of all sorts, especially shields and breastplates, but also on walls and gates. Thus, on the south wall of the Athenian Acropolis, a large gilded Gorgoneion was set on an aegis (Pausan. i. 21. 4). In the popular belief the Gorgon 's head was also a means of protection against all enchantment, whether of word or act, and we thus find it throughout Greek history employed as a powerful amulet, and often carved with graceful settings on decorative furniture and costly ornaments. But the Greek artists, with their innate sense of beauty, knew, even in the case of the Gorgon , how to give adequate expression to the idea which lay at the root of the story. The story said that Medusa had been a fair maiden, whose luxuriant hair had been turned by Athené into snakes in revenge for the desecration of her sanctuary. Accordingly the head of Medusa is represented in works of art with a countenance of touching beauty, and a wealth of hair wreathed with snakes. The face was imagined as itself in the stillness of death, and thus bearing the power to turn the living to stone. The most beautiful surviving instance of this conception is the Rondanini Medusa now at Munich. The story of Medusa has suggested several fine bits of English verse, among them D. G. Rossetti's <title>Aspecta Medusa</title> and Hake's sonnet, <title>The Infant Medusa.</title>

An ancient city in Crete on the southern shore of the island, and situated on the banks of the river Lethaeus. By its two harbours, Metallum and Lebena, it communicated with the sea. Here were temples to Zeus, Apollo, and Artemis; and near the fountain of Saurus was a spring overhung by a palm-tree, a spot which tradition declared to be the scene of the loves of Zeus and <ref type="cross" target="crosseuropa">Europa</ref> (q.v.). Next to Cnossus, Gortyn was the most powerful town of Crete, and between these two cities there existed an almost continuous feud. Under the 
<pb n="741" /><cb /> Romans, Gortyn became the capital of the island. In 1884, an archaic inscription was found on the site of Gortyn, by Halbherr, in the bed of a millstream. Two fragments of the same inscription had been previously found, the new discovery making a practically complete record of a collection of laws regulating the private relations of the people of the city, with regard to such subjects as inheritance, adoption, heiresses, marriage, and divorce. The inscription is regarded as a little earlier than the year B.C. 400.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Gothōnes</hi> (in their own language <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gutans</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Gutôs</hi>). A powerful northern nation, who acted an important part in the overthrow of the Roman Empire. The name Gothi, or Goths, appears first in history in the third century, and it was then used by the Roman writers as synonymous with the more ancient one of Getae, a people who lived on the banks of the lower Danube, near the shores of the Euxine; but the identity of the two races, though maintained by Jakob Grimm, is now generally rejected. The old Scandinavian tradition in the Eddas makes their chief, Odin or Woden, to have come from the banks of the Dniester to the shores of the Baltic many centuries before the Christian era.</p>
 <p>About the middle of the third century of our era, the Goths are recorded to have crossed the Dniester, and to have devastated Dacia and Thrace. The emperor Decius lost his life in opposing them in Moesia (A.D. 251), after which his successor Gallus induced them by money to withdraw again to their old dwellings on the Dniester. They then seem to have spread eastward, and to have occupied the country about the Cimmerian Bosporus, whence they sailed across the Euxine, occupied Trebizond, and ravaged Bithynia. In the year 269 they landed in Macedonia, but were defeated by the emperor Claudius II., hence styled Gothicus. Three years after, Aurelian gave up Dacia to a tribe of Goths, who are believed to have been the Visigoths or Western Goths, while those who ravaged Asia Minor were the Ostrogoths or Eastern Goths. This distinction of the race into two grand divisions appears about this time. Under Constantine I. the Goths from Dacia invaded Illyricum, but were repelled. Constantine II. afterwards allowed a part of them to settle in Moesia, who seem to have soon after embraced Christianity, as it was for them that Ulphilas (Wulfila) translated the Scriptures, about the middle of the fourth century, into the dialect called Moeso-Gothic. About the year 375, the Huns, coming from the East, fell upon the Ostrogoths, and drove them upon the Visigoths, who were living north of the Danube. The latter, being hard pressed, implored permission of the Roman commander to be allowed to cross that river, and take shelter in the territory of the Empire. The emperor Valens consented, and a vast multitude of them were allowed to settle in Moesia, where soon afterwards they quarrelled with the Roman authorities, invaded Thrace, and defeated and killed Valens, who came to oppose them (A.D. 378). From that time they exercised great influence over the Byzantine court, either as allies and mercenaries, or as formidable enemies. Towards <cb /> the end of the fourth century, Alaric, being chosen king of the Visigoths, invaded Northern Italy, but was defeated by Stilicho near Verona (A.D. 402). He came again, however, about six years after, and plundered Rome (A.D. 410). His successor Ataulphus (Atawulf) made peace with the Empire, and repaired to the south of Gaul, where the Visigoths founded the kingdom of Toulouse, from which they afterwards passed into Spain, where a Visigothic dynasty reigned for more than two centuries, till it was conquered by the Moors.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile the Ostrogoths or Eastern Goths, who had settled in Pannonia, after the destruction of the kingdom of the Huns, extended their dominion over Noricum, Rhaetia, and Illyricum, and about the year 489 they invaded Italy, under their king, Theodoric, and defeated Odoacer, king of the Heruli, who had assumed the title of King of Italy, a title which Theodoric then took for himself, with the consent of the Eastern emperor. Theodoric was an able prince: his reign was a period of rest for Italy, and his wise administration did much towards healing the wounds of that country. But his successors degenerated, and the Gothic dominion over Italy lasted only till 553, when it was overthrown by Narses, the general of Justinian.</p>
 <p>From this time the Goths figure no longer as a power in the history of Western Europe, except in Spain. Their name, however, is found perpetuated long after in Scandinavia, where a kingdom of Gotha existed until the twelfth century, distinct from Sweden Proper, until both crowns were united on the head of Charles Swerkerson <bibl default="NO">(A.D. 1161)</bibl>, who assumed the title of King of the Swedes and the Goths. It is probable, however, that the Gothland of Sweden is etymologically not “the land of the Goths,” but “the land of the Gauts,” a distinct though kindred people. An Ostrogothic people also settled the Crimea in the fourth century, so that the peninsula was officially styled Gothia by the Greek Church down to the eighteenth century. In 1750, the Jesuit Mondorf learned from a native of the Crimea that his countrymen spoke a dialect bearing some likeness to German. The Gothic language is now classed with the Scandinavian in the “East Germanic group.” See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.</p>

<head orig="Gracchus">Gracchus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Sempronius</hi>, the father of the Gracchi, married Cornelia, daughter of Scipio Africanus the Elder. He died while his sons were young, having twice filled the office of consul, and, according to Plutarch, obtained two triumphs. He was censor in B.C. 169. As a soldier he carried on war with distinction against the Celtiberi in Spain (B.C. 181) and the Sardinians (177). He had twelve children by Cornelia. After the death of her husband, Cornelia refused all offers of marriage, and devoted herself to the charge and education of her children, who, as Plutarch tells us, were less the inheritors of manly virtue by being sprung from the noblest blood in Rome than they were its possessors from the careful nurture of their mother Cornelia ( <title>Gracch.</title>).</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosstiberius">Tiberius</ref>, elder son of the preceding, was born B.C. 163. Tiberius served his first campaign in Africa under his uncle Scipio, and having obtained the office of consul's quaestor, we find him next under Mancinus, the unfortunate commander in the Numantine War. His name, which the Numantines respected from remembering his father's virtues, is said to have procured the terms under which Mancinus obtained safety for his army; but the Senate, on his return, was so much displeased at the unfavourable nature of these conditions that it resolved on giving up all the principal officers to the Numantines. By the good-will, however, of the popular assembly, influenced, as it would seem, by the soldiers and their connections in the lower classes, it was decided to send Mancinus as the real criminal, and to spare the other officers for the sake of Gracchus. Treatment of this nature was likely to rouse Gracchus against the Senate, and make him the friend of the poor; and accordingly, in three years afterwards, we find him beginning his short career as a political agitator. He was elected tribune of the people B.C. 128, and immediately began to attempt the revival of the Licinian Rogations. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossagrariae-leges">Agrariae Leges</ref>; Rogationes Liciniae.) In so doing he appears to have had in view the two grand principles which that law involved—namely, the employment of freemen in preference to slaves in cultivating the soil, and especially the more generally recognized principle of the equitable division of the public land. Three commissioners were appointed to superintend the working of the new law which Gracchus had proposed, if Plutarch may be trusted, with the approval of some of the most eminent persons of the times, among whom were Mucius Scaevola and Crassus the orator. Such general interest was excited by the question, that crowds arrived from all parts of the country to support either side; and there appeared no doubt which way the matter would go when left to the tribes. The aristocracy, however, secured the veto of M. Octavius, one of the tribunes, and thereby quashed the proceedings whenever the law was brought on, which violent mode of opposition led Gracchus to exercise his veto on other questions, stop the supplies, and throw the government into the most complete helplessness.</p>
 <p>Thus far the contest had been constitutional; but now, Gracchus, irritated by continual opposition, invited Octavius to propose his [Gracchus's] ejection from the office of tribune; and on his refusal, pleading the utter uselessness of two men so different in sentiment holding the same office, he put the question to the tribes that Octavius be <cb /> ejected. When the first seventeen out of the thirty-five tribes had voted for it, Gracchus again implored him to resign; and, on his entreaty proving unsuccessful, polled another tribe, constituting a majority, and sent his officers to drag Octavius from the tribune's chair. The Agrarian Law was forthwith passed; and Gracchus himself, his brother Caius, and his father-in-law Appius Claudius, were appointed the commissioners. But the Senate, to show their opinion of the whole proceeding, withheld from him the usual allowance for a public officer. While things were in this state, Attalus, king of Pergamus, bequeathed his kingdom and treasures to the Roman people; and, to enhance his own popularity, Gracchus proposed to divide the treasure among the recipients of land under the new law, to enable them to stock their farms, and to commit the management of the kingdom of Pergamus to the popular assembly. This brought matters to a greater pitch of distrust than ever. Gracchus was accused by one senator of aspiring to tyranny, and by another of having violated the sanctity of the tribunitian office in deposing Octavius. On this point Gracchus strove to justify himself before the people, but his opponent seemed to have gained an advantage so great as to induce him to postpone the assembly. When at last he did make his defence, it rested, if Plutarch is correct, on false analogies, and on avoiding the question of the inviolability of a public officer. At this juncture Gracchus seems to have trembled for that popularity which alone preserved him from impeachment; and, lest it should fail, endeavoured to secure his own reëlection to the office of tribune. The other party had demurred as to his eligibility to the office two years in succession, and on the day of election this point occupied the assembly till nightfall. Next morning, accompanied by a crowd of partisans, he went to the Capitol; and, on hearing that the Senate had determined to oppose him by force, armed his followers with staves, and prepared to clear the Capitol. At this juncture, Publius Scipio Nasica, having in vain called on the consul to take measures for the safety of the State, issued from the Temple of Faith, where the Senate had assembled, followed by the whole nobility of Rome. He put the mob to flight, seized their weapons, and attacked all who fell in his way. About three hundred perished, and among the slain was Gracchus, who was killed by repeated blows on the head, B.C. 133 ( <title>Tib. Gracch.</title>). See Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, vol. ii. pp. 92-126 <bibl default="NO">(American ed. 1888)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, was nine years younger than his brother Tiberius, and at his death was left with Appius Claudius as commissioner for carrying out the Agrarian Law. By the death of Appius, and of Tiberius's successor, Licinius Crassus, the agrarian commission consisted of Fulvius Flaccus, Papirius Carbo, and himself; but he refrained from taking any part in public affairs for more than ten years after the death of Tiberius. During this time the provisions of his brother's law were carried out by Carbo and Flaccus; but Gaius does not seem to have begun his career as an independent political leader until the year B.C. 123, when, on his return from Sardinia, where he had been for two years, he was elected tribune of the people. His first act was to propose two laws, one of which, directed against the degraded tribune Octavius, disqualified all who had been thus degraded from holding any magistracy; and 
<pb n="743" /><cb /> the other, having in view Pompilius, a prominent opponent of the popular party, denounced the banishment of a Roman citizen without trial as a violation of the Roman laws. The first was never carried through; to the latter was added a third, by which Pompilius was banished from Italy, or, according to technical phraseology, interdicted from fire and water. These measures were followed by others, by which he aimed at establishing his own popularity. One of them was a poor-law, by which a monthly distribution of corn was made to the people at an almost nominal price. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfrumentariae-leges">Frumentariae Leges</ref>.) The effect of this law was to make the population of Rome paupers, and to attract all Italy to partake of the bounty. Next came organic changes, as they would now be called; and of these the most important was the transference of the judicial power from the senators, wholly or in part, to the equestrian order. This measure, according to Cicero, worked well; but, in weighing his opinion, we must remember his partiality for the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, and add to this the fact that his eulogies occur in an advocate's speech (<title>In Verr. Act.</title> i.).</p>
 <p>Gracchus now possessed unlimited power with the populace; and, at the end of the year, not more than ten candidates for the office of tribune having appeared, he was again elected. His second tribuneship was mostly employed in passing laws respecting the colonies, in which matter the aristocratic agent, Livius Drusus, outdid him; and, having won the confidence of the people by his apparent disinterestedness, ventured (being himself a tribune) to interpose his veto to one of Gracchus's measures. The appointment of Gracchus, soon after, to the office of commissioner for planting a colony near Carthage removed him from the scenes of his popularity; and, soon after his return, a proposal was made to repeal the very law which he had been engaged in carrying out, relative to the colony in Africa. This law was not his own measure, but that of one Rubrius, another of the tribunes, and was one of those enactments which had alienated from Gracchus the favour of the people, it having been represented by his opponents as an impious act to build again the walls of Carthage, which Scipio had solemnly devoted to perpetual desolation. Gracchus was now a private person, his second tribuneship having expired; but yet, as such, he opposed the proposition to repeal, and, unfortunately for himself, united with M. Fulvins Flaccus, one of the commissioners of the Agrarian Law, and a man whose character was respected by no party in the Republic. The reputation of Gracchus had already suffered from his connection with Fulvius; and now he took part with him in designs which could be considered as nothing less than treasonable. Charging the Senate with spreading false reports, in order to alarm the religious scruples of the people, the two popular leaders assembled a numerous body of their partisans armed with daggers, and, being thus prepared for violence, they proceeded to the Capitol, where the people were to meet in order to decide on the repeal of the law of Rubrius. Here, before the business of the day was yet begun, a private citizen, who happened to be engaged in offering a sacrifice, was murdered by the partisans of Fulvius and Gracchus for some words or gestures which they regarded as insulting. This outrage excited a general alarm; the assembly broke up in consternation; and the popular leaders, <cb /> after trying in vain to gain a hearing from the people, while they disclaimed the violence committed by their followers, had no other course left than to withdraw to their own homes. There they concerted plans of resistance, which were considered by the people as an open rebellion against the government of the country. The consul Opimius, exaggerating, perhaps, the alarm which he felt from the late outrage, hastily summoned the Senate together; the body of the murdered man was exposed to the view of the people, and the Capitol was secured at break of day with an armed force. The Senate, being informed by Opimius of the state of affairs, proceeded to invest him with absolute power to act in defence of the commonwealth, in the usual form of a resolution, “that the consul should provide for the safety of the Republic.” At the same time Gracchus and Fulvius were summoned to appear before the Senate to answer for the murder laid to their charge. Instead of obeying, they occupied the Aventine Hill with a body of their partisans in arms, and invited the slaves to join them, promising them their freedom. Opimius, followed by the senators and the members of the equestrian order, who, with their dependants, had armed themselves by his directions, and accompanied by a body of regular soldiers, advanced against the rebels, who had made two fruitless attempts at negotiation, by sending to the consul the son of Fulvius. In the meantime the conduct of Gaius Gracchus was that of a man irresolute in the course which he pursued, and with too much regard for his country to engage heartily in the criminal attempt into which he had suffered himself to be drawn. He had left his house, it is said, in his ordinary dress; he had already urged upon Fulvius to propose the terms of a compromise to the Senate; and now, when the Aventine was attacked, he took personally no part in the action. The contest, indeed, was soon over. The rebels were presently dispersed. Fulvius was dragged from the place to which he had fled for refuge, and was put to death; while Gracchus, finding himself closely pursued, fled across the Tiber, and, taking shelter in a grove sacred to the goddess Furrina, was killed, at his own desire, by a servant who had accompanied his flight. His head, together with that of Fulvius, was cut off and carried to the consul, in order to obtain the price which had been set upon both by a proclamation issued at the beginning of the conflict; and the bodies, as well as those of all who had perished on the same side, were thrown into the Tiber. In addition to this, the houses of Gracchus and Fulvius were given up to plunder, their property was confiscated, and even the wife of Gracchus was deprived of her dowry. It is said that in this sedition there perished altogether of the partisans of the popular leaders about 3000, partly in the action and partly by summary executions afterwards, under the consul's orders.</p>
 <p>There is little doubt that Gracchus aimed at monarchical power, but many writers, among them Mommsen, justify his purpose on the plea that an absolute monarchy is a less evil than an absolute oligarchy such as that which existed at Rome in the second century B.C.

<head orig="Graffiti">Graffiti</head>

 <p> (plural of the Italian <hi rend="italic">graffito</hi>, “a scratching”). A name used of the inscriptions, drawings, and scrawls found upon the walls, doorposts, pillars, and tombs of Rome, Pompeii, and other ancient cities. They are the work of idlers—schoolboys, slaves, loungers, etc.—and are valuable as giving an insight into the daily life, habits, and thoughts of the common people, as well as furnishing, at times, valuable hints as to the nature of 
<pb n="745" /><cb />
 the popular language. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.) They are usually scratched with some sharp instrument—for instance, a <seg lang="la">stilus</seg>, or written with charcoal or red chalk—and are of the most varied character, as might be expected, comprising quotations from the poets, doggerel verses, insulting, coarse, and often obscene words and figures, caricatures, popular catchwords, and amatory effusions, in each of the three languages common in southern Italy—Greek, Latin, and Oscan. They are often of a more serious character, intended as handbills. Of this class, we find advertisements of plays, election notices, public announcements, and admonitions to servants. The following is an example of the political <hi rend="italic">graffito:</hi> VETTIVM FIRMVM <figure id="fig.00745">

PILICREPI FACITE (<title>Aulum Vettium Firmum aedilem, oro vos faciatis, dignum re publica virum oro vos. facite pilicrepi, facite!</title>), an appeal to the <seg lang="la">pilicrepi</seg> or ball-players of the city to rally round a kindred spirit and friend of sport. Many quotations from the poets appear, Ovid and Propertius being great favourites, but only one complete line from Vergil is found among the <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> collected by Garrucci. Of the poetic quotations from the <title>Aeneid</title>, the following (i. 1) is interesting as throwing light on the vulgar pronunciation of the letter R: ALMA VILVMQVE CANO TLO—. Occasionally a line from some poet is altered to suit the purposes of the writer, as the following: CANDIDA ME DOCVIT NIGRAS ODISSE PUELLAS, evidently a variation of the Propertian line: <title>Cynthia me docuit castas odisse puellas</title>, and intended to flatter some blonde. A love-quarrel between Virgula and her lover Tertius is indicated by the following: VIRGVLA TERTIO SVO: INDECENS ES. There are many allusions to athletic and gladiatorial games. One Epaphras, whose name often appears, is told that he “doesn't know how to play ball” (EPAPHRA PILICREPVS NON ES), and some friend of Epaphras has drawn a line through the last three words. School-boys have scratched their lessons by way of practice on <figure id="fig.00745.2">

</figure> <cb /> the walls, since there are long lists of nouns, verbs, etc., and alphabets repeated again and again.</p>
 <p>An interesting <hi rend="italic">graffito</hi> is that represented in the preceding illustration. It was first published by Father Garrucci in 1857, and is now in the Kircherian Museum of the Jesuit College at Rome. Apparently it belongs to the third century A.D., and is in ridicule of a person, one Alexamenos, who is represented as worshipping a crucified figure depicted with the head of an ass. Beneath is scrawled in Greek the sentence <foreign lang="greek">ΑΛΕΞΑΜΕΝΟΣ ΣΕΒΕΤΕ [ΣΕΒΕΤΑΙ] ΘΕΟΝ</foreign>, “Alexamenos worships (his) God.” It was found in one of the subterranean chambers of the Palatine in 1856. Scholars are not wholly agreed as to the subject of this caricature, some believing it to be a blasphemous representation of Christ, while others think it refers to Anubis, the jackal-headed god of Egypt. Prof. Lanciani in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries</title> (Boston, 1888)</bibl> mentions an interesting collection of <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> discovered in 1868 on the walls of an <seg lang="la">excubitorium</seg>, or station-house, and made by the Roman policemen when off duty. These can be seen in the <title>Annali dell' Instituto</title> for 1869, edited by Henzen.</p>
 <p>Another well-executed drawing from the Palatine walls is that given above. It represents an ass turning a mill with the inscription, LABORA ASELLE QVOMODO EGO LABORAVI ET PRODERIT TIBI (“Toil on, little ass, as I have done, and much good may it do you!”), possibly written by a slave who had been made to do a turn at the mill (<seg lang="la">pistrinum</seg>) as a punishment (cf.  <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 1. 2. 28" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Andr.</title>i. 2. 28</bibl>). The subjoined <hi rend="italic">graffito</hi>, which resembles the attempt of a modern school-boy, is from the bar<figure id="fig.00745.3">

It caricatures one Nonius Maximus, whose name appears elsewhere on the same walls coupled with insulting words, and who was probably a centurion whose strictness had made him unpopular.</p>
 <p>Another Pompeian wall-caricature refers to a fierce town-andcountry fight in the amphitheatre between the Pompeians and Nucerians, as the result of which Nero forbade the Pompeians to open the amphitheatre for a period of ten years. The <hi rend="italic">graffito</hi> represents an armed man descending into the arena bearing the palm of victory, while on the other side a prisoner is being dragged away in bonds. The legend in the corner gives a clue to the meaning of the caricature. It reads: CAMPANI VICTORIA VNA CVM NVCERINIS PERISTIS

 <p>The first notice of this class of inscriptions appeared in the <title>Journal de Fouilles</title> for October 18th, 1765; and in 1792 the German archaeologist Murr published at Nuremberg a collection of <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> that had been transcribed for him by a friend.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματεύς</foreign>). The Greek word for a writer, secretary, or clerk. At Athens the officials had numerous clerks attached to them, who were paid by the State and belonged to the poorer class of citizens. But there were several higher officials who bore the title of grammateus. The Boulé, or Senate, for instance, chose one of its members by show of hands to be its clerk or secretary for one year. His duty was to keep the archives of the Senate. So, too, a secretary was chosen by lot from the whole number of senators <cb /> for each prytany to draft all resolutions of the Senate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossprytanis">Prytanis</ref>.) His name is therefore generally given in the decrees next to that of the president and the proposer of the decree. The name of the grammateus of the first prytany was also given with that of the archon, as a means of marking the year with more accuracy. At the meetings of the Ecclesia, a clerk, elected by the people, had to read out the necessary documents. The office of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιγραφεῖς</foreign>, or checking clerks, was of still greater importance. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιγραφεύς</foreign> of the Senate, elected at first by show of hands, but afterwards by lot, had to take account of all business affecting the financial administration. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιγραφεύς</foreign> of the administration had to make out, and lay before the public, a general statement of income and expenditure, and exercised a certain amount of control over all financial officials. In the Aetolian and Achaean leagues the grammateus was the highest officer of the league after the <seg lang="la">strategi</seg> and <hi rend="italic">hipparchi.</hi>

<head orig="Grammatĭca">Grammatica</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματική</foreign>, <seg lang="la">litteratura</seg>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">In Greece</hi>.—The term <foreign lang="greek">γραμματική</foreign>, in the scientific sense, included, in antiquity, all the main philological branches, grammar proper, lexicography, prosody, the lower and higher criticism, antiquities —everything, in short, necessary to the understanding and explanation of <foreign lang="greek">γράμματα</foreign>, or the treasures of literature, whether their form or their matter be in question. It was first developed into a special science during the Alexandrian Age, in Alexandria and Pergamum, where the great libraries gave ample opportunity for philological studies on the scale above indicated. It was the restoration of the text of the Homeric poems and the explanation of their words and contents that primarily exercised the minds of the scholars. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>.) Hesiod, the lyric poets, the dramatists, and certain prose writers next engaged their attention. The progress and development of philology is marked by the names of Zenodotus (about B.C. 280), Aristophanes of Byzantium (260-183), and Aristarchus (about 170), the three chief representatives of the Alexandrian School. To these must be added Crates (about 160), the head of the school of Pergamum, and the opponent of the Alexandrians. The name of <ref type="cross" target="crossaristarchus">Aristarchus</ref> (q.v.) represents the highest point of philological learning and criticism in antiquity. He was the founder of the celebrated school of Aristarcheans, which continued to exist and to maintain an uninterrupted tradition down to the first century of the imperial age. His disciple, Dionysius Thrax, wrote the oldest manual of grammar that we possess, and his work compiled for the use of his students at Rome (<foreign lang="greek">Τέχνη Γραμματική</foreign>) became the basis of all subsequent grammars and was used for centuries either in the original or in Latin translations. From it, through the Latin equivalents, came most of the technical terms of modern grammar. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysius">Dionysius Thrax</ref>.) He did not, however, originate these terms. Some of them are 
<pb n="747" /><cb /> as old as the time of Plato, who recognizes two parts of speech, the noun (<foreign lang="greek">ὄνομα</foreign>) and the verb (<foreign lang="greek">ῥῆμα</foreign>). Aristotle names four—noun, verb, article (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρθρον</foreign>), and conjunction (<foreign lang="greek">συνδεσμός</foreign>). The Stoic grammarians give six—noun, verb, article, conjunction, proper noun (<foreign lang="greek">προσηγορία</foreign>), and adverb. Aristarchus raised the number to eight—noun, verb, article, conjunction, pronoun (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντωνομία</foreign>), adverb (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίρρημα</foreign>), participle (<foreign lang="greek">μετοχή</foreign>), and preposition (<foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>). The Greeks, who were accustomed to see in Homer all possible wisdom, claimed that he knew of the eight parts of speech, citing in proof of it two lines (<title>Iliad</title>, i. 185; xxii. 59), each of which contains them all. By far the most celebrated of the later Aristarcheans was Didymus Chalcenterus, born about B.C. 63. His writings are the chief foundation of the Byzantine collections of <hi rend="italic">scholia.</hi> The science of <foreign lang="greek">γραμματική</foreign> gradually narrowed its scope till it confined itself to grammar in the restricted sense of the word—namely, accidence and syntax, combined with lexical researches into the dialects, and into the usages of special periods of literature and special groups of authors. The most eminent scholars of the Empire are Apollonius Dyscolus (about A.D. 150), the founder of scientific syntax, who endeavoured to reduce the whole of empirical grammar to a system, and his son, Aelius Herodianus, a still more important personage. The writings of the latter form one of the chief authorities of the later grammarians, such as Arcadius. The lexical writings of the earlier scholars were often very comprehensive, and have only survived in fragments or in later extracts, such as that of Hesychius. They had consisted mainly of collections of glosses (<foreign lang="greek">γλῶσσαι</foreign>) or strange and antiquated expressions. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossglossa">Glossa</ref>.) But in the second century A.D. the influence of the reviving sophistic literature and education turned the attention of lexicographers to the usage of the Attic writers. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslexicon">Lexicon</ref>.) This tendency is represented in the surviving works of Pollux, Harpocration, and others. To the same period belongs Hephaestion's manual of prosody, which is the only complete treatise on this subject. Athenaeus, at the beginning of the third century, wrote a work (the <title>Deipnosophistae</title>) of inestimable value to the student of antiquities. Longinus, who died A.D. 273, may be regarded as the last considerable scholar of the ancient world. The later grammarians restricted themselves to compiling extracts from the works of earlier ages.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">At Rome</hi>.—After the middle of the second century B.C. a lively interest in the history of literature and the study of language arose in Rome. It had been excited by the lectures on Greek authors given by Crates of Mallos during his sojourn in Rome as ambassador (B.C. 159). Not only writers of repute, such as Attius and Lucilius, but men like Aelius Stilo, a member of the equestrian order, who was actively engaged in public life, took up these studies with eagerness. What was afterwards known of the primitive Latin language we owe mainly to Aelius Stilo. He was the master of the great encyclopaedist, Marcus Terentius Varro, Cicero's contemporary. This great scholar left his mark on every department of philological research, and his writings were the storehouse from which the following generations mainly drew their information. Besides Varro, other men of note occupied themselves with grammatical study in the Ciceronian age, notably Nigidius Figulus. Iulius Caesar was the author of a treatise on accidence. <cb /> There were numerous scholars in the Augustan Age, among whom Verrius Flaccus and Hyginus deserve especial notice. In the first century A.D. we have Remmius Palaemon, Asconius Pedianus, Valerius Probus, and the elder Pliny. It was Remmius Palaemon who is mainly responsible for having made Vergil the centre of scholastic instruction for the Latin world, as Homer was for the Greek. During the second century A.D., under Hadrian and the Antonines, we notice a revived interest in the older literature. This period is distinguished by the names of Suetonius, Terentius Scaurus, and Aulus Gellius. Suetonius aspired to the mauy-sided learning of Varro, and, like Varro, was much quoted by later writers.</p>
 <p>After this time, the grammarians tended more and more to confine their studies to points of language, to abandon independent research, and to depend on the labours of their predecessors. The chief value of their writings consists in the fact that they have preserved many fragments of ancient learning. Their extracts are usually made for school purposes, and put together in <seg lang="la">artes</seg>, or manuals of accidence, orthography, prosody, and metre. Such are the books of Marius Victorinus, Donatus, Servius, Charisius, Diomedes, who are all to be assigned to the fourth century A.D. Nonius Marcellus belongs to the same period. He is the author of a work (<title>De Compendiosa Doctrina</title>) which, though dreary and uncritical, is invaluable for the stores of old Latin which it has preserved. The sixth century is marked by the name of Priscian, whose work in eighteen books (<title>Institutiones Grammaticae</title>) is the most important grammatical treatise that has come down to us from the Romans. It was the standard book on the subject through the Middle Ages, and more than 1000 MSS. of it have been preserved. We may further notice Terentianus Maurus, the author of a versified treatise on metre in the third century; Macrobius, who in the fifth century composed a miscellany of antiquities called <title>Saturnalia;</title> and Isidorus, bishop of Seville, in the seventh century, whose <title>Origines</title> is the last work founded on a real study of ancient authorities.</p>

<head orig="Gratiānus">Gratianus</head>

 <p> (1) The eldest son of Valentinian I., succeeding, after his father's death, A.D. 375, to a share of the Western Empire, having for his portion Gaul, Spain, and Britain. His brother, Valentinian II., then an infant under five years of age, had Italy, Illyricum, and Africa, under the guardianship, however, of Gratianus, who was therefore, in reality, ruler of all the West. His uncle Valens had the Empire of the East. Gratianus began his reign by punishing severely various prefects and other officers who had committed acts of oppression and cruelty during his father's reign. At the same time, through some insidious charges, Count Theodosius, father of Theodosius the Great, and one of the most illustrious men of his age, was beheaded at Carthage. In the year 378, Valens perished in the battle of Adrianople against the Goths, and Gratianus, who was hastening to his assistance, was hardly able to save Constantinople from falling into the hands of the enemy. In consequence of the death of his uncle, <cb /> Gratianus, finding himself ruler of the whole Roman Empire during the minority of his brother Valentinian, called to him young Theodosius, who had distinguished himself in the Roman armies. Gratianus appointed him his colleague, a choice equally creditable to both and fortunate for the Empire, and gave him the provinces of the East. Gratianus now returned to Italy, but was obliged soon after to hasten to Illyricum to the assistance of Theodosius, and repelled the Goths, who were threatening Thrace. Thence he was forced to march to the banks of the Rhine, to fight the Alemanni and other barbarians. Having returned to Mediolanum in the year 381, he had to defend the frontiers of Italy from other tribes, who were advancing on the side of Rhaetia. Gratianus showed himself stern and unyielding towards the remains of the heathen worship. At Rome he overthrew the altar of Victory and confiscated the property attached to it, as well as all that which belonged to the other priests and the vestals. He also refused to assume the title and insignia of Pontifex Maximus, a dignity till then considered as annexed to that of emperor. These measures gave a final blow to the old worship of the Empire; and although the senators, who, for the most part, were still attached to it, sent him a deputation, at the head of which was Symmachus, they could not obtain any mitigation of his decrees. In the year 383, a certain Maximus revolted in Britain, and was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers, to whom he promised to re-establish the temples and the old religion of the Empire. He invaded Gaul, where he found numerous partisans. Gratianus advanced to meet him, but was forsaken by most of his troops, and obliged to hasten towards Italy. He was seized at Lugdunum, and put to death by the partisans of Maximus. He was little more than twenty-four years of age, and had reigned about eight years.</p>

<head orig="Greek, Pronunciation of">Greek, Pronunciation of</head>

 <p> Three different methods of pronouncing Greek have been followed in the schools of America and England. They may be called, respectively, the English method; the Reuchlinian or modern Greek method; and the Erasmian method.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. The English method</hi> gives the letters their ordinary English sounds, but follows the Latin rules of accent (accenting the penult if it is long 
<pb n="749" /><cb />
 in quantity, but otherwise the antepenult). This method is still current in England, but has almost disappeared in the United States.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. The Reuchlinian method</hi>, called after <ref type="cross" target="crossreuchlin">Reuchlin</ref> (q.v.), a great scholar of the fifteenth century, who was one of its earliest advocates, aims to follow the pronunciation of the modern Greeks. Of the vowels, <foreign lang="greek">η, υ, ει, οι</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">υι</foreign>, all have the sound of <seg lang="la">i</seg> in <hi rend="italic">machine;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αι</foreign> is pronounced much like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <seg lang="la">fate.</seg> In the diphthongs <foreign lang="greek">αυ, ευ, ηυ</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ωυ, υ</foreign> is pronounced like <hi rend="italic">v</hi> when the diphthong stands before a vowel, or <foreign lang="greek">β, γ, δ, ζ, λ, μ, ν, ρ</foreign>; otherwise like <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">π, κ, τ</foreign>, after nasals, are pronounced like <seg lang="la">b, g, d.</seg> <foreign lang="greek">χ</foreign> has the two sounds of German <hi rend="italic">ch.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">δ</foreign> is pronounced like <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in German <hi rend="italic">ach</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign> like English <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> It has been argued that scholars ought to agree to pronounce Greek as the Greeks of today pronounce it, but many changes and corruptions have crept in during the centuries since the classical period; so that the pronunciation which prevails in Athens at present differs widely from that of ancient times. This method has therefore found few adherents in England or America, though it has been strongly advocated by a number of eminent men.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. The Erasmian method</hi>, first proposed by Erasmus in a humorous dialogue published at Basle in 1528 (see below), is the one which is now prevalent in the United States and on the continent of Europe, though with various modifications. In the United States the ordinary pronunciation is as follows: <foreign lang="greek">α</foreign> like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <hi rend="italic">father;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> like <seg lang="la">a</seg> in <seg lang="la">fate;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ε</foreign> like <seg lang="la">e</seg> in <seg lang="la">met;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> like <seg lang="la">i</seg> in <hi rend="italic">machine;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign> like <seg lang="la">o</seg> in <seg lang="la">note;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign> the same sound, but shorter; <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign> as French <hi rend="italic">u</hi> or German <hi rend="italic">ü;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αι</foreign> like <seg lang="la">ai</seg> in <hi rend="italic">aisle;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign> like <seg lang="la">ei</seg> in <hi rend="italic">freight</hi> (or more often like <seg lang="la">ei</seg> in <hi rend="italic">height</hi>); <foreign lang="greek">οι</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> in <hi rend="italic">boil;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">υι</foreign> like <seg lang="la">ui</seg> in <hi rend="italic">quit;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αυ</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> in <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ευ</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">eu</hi> in <hi rend="italic">feud;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ου</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> in <hi rend="italic">soup;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ</foreign> like <foreign lang="greek">α, η, ω</foreign>. The consonants are pronounced as in English, except that <foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> is always hard; before a palatal it is pronounced like <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in <hi rend="italic">anxious;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">dz;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">θ</foreign> like <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> (not like <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <seg lang="la">this</seg>); <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign> never like <hi rend="italic">z;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">τ</foreign> never aspirated; <foreign lang="greek">χ</foreign> like German <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in <hi rend="italic">ach.</hi> The written accent is followed in pronunciation.</p>
 <p>We have so far been describing the methods of pronunciation generally followed by modern scholars. How the ancient Greeks pronounced is very difficult to determine, but on many points a tolerable degree of certainty can be arrived at. When the comic poets transcribed the cry of a sheep with <foreign lang="greek">βῆ, βῆ</foreign>, it is plain that <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign> was not pronounced like <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, or <foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> like <seg lang="la">i</seg> in <hi rend="italic">machine</hi>, as in modern Greek. So, too, <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign> cannot have been pronounced like <seg lang="la">i</seg> in <hi rend="italic">machine</hi>, as is seen from the description of the two sounds in Dion. Hal. ( <bibl n="D. H. Comp. 14. 96" default="NO"> <title>Comp.</title>xiv. 96</bibl>), and from the existence of the diphthong <foreign lang="greek">υι</foreign>. It is probable that <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign> originally received the sound of <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">boot</hi>, later that of French <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (German <hi rend="italic">ü</hi>), and not until the ninth or tenth century of our era the sound of <seg lang="la">i</seg> in <hi rend="italic">machine.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">οι</foreign> were true diphthongal sounds until a late period (<foreign lang="greek">αι</foreign>=<hi rend="italic">ah-ee=i</hi> in <hi rend="italic">pine;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">οι</foreign>=<hi rend="italic">o-ee =oi</hi> in <hi rend="italic">boil</hi>, nearly). <foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign> was at first a true diphthong (<foreign lang="greek">ε-εε</foreign>=<seg lang="la">e</seg> in <seg lang="la">ere</seg>, nearly); about B.C. 400 it came to be the simple sound of <seg lang="la">ei</seg> in <hi rend="italic">rein;</hi> and not till much later was it sounded like <seg lang="la">ei</seg> in <hi rend="italic">seize.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">αυ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ευ</foreign> were true diphthongs (<hi rend="italic">ah-oo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ĕ-oo</hi>). <foreign lang="greek">ου</foreign> was originally a diphthongal sound, but later assumed the sound of <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> in <hi rend="italic">youth.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">υι</foreign> was probably like French <seg lang="la">ui</seg> in <seg lang="la">lui.</seg> In the so-called improper diphthongs, <foreign lang="greek">ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> was probably pronounced <cb /> until about the second century B.C., when it became silent, and was often omitted, even in writing. Of the consonants <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>, which in modern Greek has the sound of <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, was reckoned a mute by the ancient Greeks, and hence must have been sounded as in English. The same argument proves that <foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δ</foreign> received their English, rather than their modern Greek, sounds. But <foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign> before palatals had the sound of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in <hi rend="italic">anxious.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign> was pronounced like <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sink</hi>, except before middle mutes and liquids, when it was pronounced like <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in <hi rend="italic">as.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign> had the sound of <hi rend="italic">sd</hi> or <hi rend="italic">zd</hi>, as is seen from such compounds as <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθήναζε</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">Ἀθήνας-δε</foreign>), and from the fact that the preposition <foreign lang="greek">συν</foreign> loses <foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign>, just as before <foreign lang="greek">στ, σπ</foreign>, etc. The aspirates <foreign lang="greek">φ, χ, θ</foreign> were pronounced as two sounds (<hi rend="italic">p-h, k-h</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">τ</foreign>-<hi rend="italic">h</hi>), as in English <hi rend="italic">uphill, block-house, hothouse.</hi> This conclusion is drawn from the fact that these consonants were classed as mutes and not as spirants. The ancient consonant called <seg lang="la">digamma</seg> or <hi rend="italic">vau</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign>) was probably pronounced like English <hi rend="italic">w</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, as the strong <hi rend="italic">v</hi>-sound would not have disappeared so quickly or completely as the digamma did.</p>
 <p>The accent in ancient Greek consisted in a raising of the pitch, and not in the stress or duration of the sound. But the latter element was added at the period of the decay of the language, and the Greeks of to-day make all accented vowels long and all unaccented vowels short. When this change took place can be determined only approximately, but it must have been during the Alexandrian period and before the beginning of our era, as may be gathered from some of the rules of prosody observed by such poets as Babrius and Nonnus. The difference between high pitch and low pitch, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, amounted to almost a fifth (Dion. Hal. <bibl n="D. H. Comp. 58" default="NO"> <title>Comp.</title>58</bibl>).</p>

Among his fellow students was Julian , the future emperor, and Basil, with the latter of whom he formed a most intimate friendship. Gregory remained at Athens about six years (350-356), and then returned home. Having received ordination, 
<pb n="750" /><cb />
 he continued to reside at Nazianzus, where he discharged his duties as a presbyter, and assisted his father, who was bishop of the town. In A.D. 372 he was associated with his father in the bishopric; but after the death of the latter in 374, he refused to continue Bishop of Nazianzus, as he was averse to public life and fond of solitary meditation. After living some years in retirement, he was summoned to Constantinople in 379, in order to defend the orthodox faith against the Arians and other heretics. In 380 he was made Bishop of Constantinople by the emperor Theodosius; but he resigned the office in the following year (381), and withdrew altogether from public life. He lived in solitude at his paternal estate at Nazianzus, and died there in 389 or 390. His extant works are about 45 orations or sermons, 243 letters, and 407 poems of a very varied description, comprising hymns, prayers, epitaphs, epigrams, etc. His discourses, though sometimes really eloquent, are generally little more than favourable specimens of the rhetoric of the schools, more earnest than Chrysostom, but less attractive. The Benedictine edition was published at Paris <bibl default="NO">(1778-1842)</bibl>. See the monographs by Ullmann <bibl default="NO">(Eng. trans. 1851)</bibl>; and by A. Benoît <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1876)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Nyssēnus</hi>, bishop of Nyssa in Cappadocia, was the younger brother of Basil, and was born at Caesarea in Cappadocia, about A.D. 331. He was made bishop of Nyssa about 372, and, like his brother Basil and their friend Gregory Nazienzen, was one of the pillars of orthodoxy. He died soon after A.D. 394. Like his brother, he was an eminent rhetorician, though his oratory often offends by its extravagance. His works are printed in Migne's <title>Patrologia</title>, vols. xliv.-xlvi.</p>
 <p>(3) Styled <hi rend="SmallCaps">Thaumaturgus</hi>, from his miracles, was born at Neocaesarea in Cappadocia, of heathen parents. He was converted to Christianity by Origen about A.D. 234, and subsequently became the bishop of his native town. He died about the year 265. His celebrated <foreign lang="greek">Ἔκθεσις</foreign>, or confession of faith, is a summary of the theology of Origen. It is said to have been divined by him through a revelation from the Virgin Mary and the Apostle John. Other treatises of doubtful authenticity are attributed to him. His works are printed in vol. x. of the Patristic collection of the Abbé Migne. See Ryssel, <bibl default="NO"><title>Gregorius Thaumaturgus: sein Leben und seine Schriften</title> (Leipzig, 1880)</bibl>; and Harnack, <title>Dogmengeschichte</title>, vol. i. <bibl default="NO">(Freiburg im Breisg. 1888)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Of Tours</hi>, called “the Father of Frankish History,” was born at Arverna (Clermont), about A.D. 540, his baptismal name being Georgius Florentius. He became Bishop of Tours in 573, and after the death of Chilperic, whom Gregory calls “the Nero and the Herod of our times,” and by whom he was much harassed, he enjoyed general esteem and consideration down to the end of his life in 594. He is best known by his <title>Historiae sive Annalium Francorum Libri X.</title>, which is the chief authority for the history of Gaul in the sixth century, beginning with an epitome of universal history, and developing the narrative with greater fulness as he proceeds. In it the author shows himself unskilled in literary composition, and his Latinity is especially interesting as a specimen of the gradual blending of the classic Latin into the rustic Latin from which the Romance languages emerged. His works are printed in vol. lxxi. of the Abbé Migne's collection. There is a French translation by Bordier, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1859-61)</bibl>, and Jacobs, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1861)</bibl>. <cb /> See Löbell, <bibl default="NO"><title>Gregor von Tours und seine Zeit</title> (2d ed. 1869)</bibl>; Pattison, <title>Essays</title>, vol. i. <bibl default="NO">(1889)</bibl>; and on his language, <bibl default="NO">Bonnet, <title>Le Latin de Grégoire de Tours</title> (1891)</bibl>.

 <p> The peculiar type or character of the Teutonic languages, distinguishing them as a class from the other Indo-European languages, is prominently determined by a general change in the pronunciation of those consonants commonly known as mutes or explosives. The other consonants remain in general unchanged, thus: <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, Lat. <seg lang="la">novus; m</seg> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, Lat. <hi rend="italic">nōmen; r</hi> in Eng. <seg lang="la">acre</seg>, Lat. <seg lang="la">ager; l</seg> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">light</hi>, Lat. <seg lang="la">lux; w</seg> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, Lat. <seg lang="la">velle; y</seg> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">yoke</hi>, Lat. <seg lang="la">jugum; s</seg> in Eng. <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>, Lat. <seg lang="la">septem;</seg> but the explosives (<seg lang="la">k, t, p, g, d, b, gh, dh, bh</seg>) occupied so prominent a place in the mechanism of the parent speech, one or more of them appearing in almost every word, that the changes which they underwent in passing into the Teutonic form could not fail to impress upon the Teutonic languages a distinct mark of individuality. The credit of first discovering the uniformity of these changes is largely due to a Danish scholar, Rasmus Kristian Rask <bibl default="NO">(1787-1832)</bibl>, but the formulation of them in the shape of a general law and the exhibition of the parallelism contained in the second or High German shifting are the work of Jakob Grimm <bibl default="NO">(1785-1863)</bibl>, first made public in the second edition of the first volume of his <bibl default="NO"><title>Deutsche Grammatik</title> (1822)</bibl>.</p>

 <p>(1) The Indo-European voiced aspirates (<hi rend="italic">gh, dh, bh</hi>) represent an explosion of voiced breath followed by an after-puff; the pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">dh</hi>, e. g. may be crudely illustrated by the sound of <hi rend="italic">d-h</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sandhill.</hi> These sounds passed readily and very early into the <hi rend="italic">affricatae gg, dd</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italic">dž</hi> in the pronunciation of Eng. <hi rend="italic">j, bb</hi>, which double sounds were then unified into the pure spirants <seg lang="la">g, d, b.</seg> The first of these (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) is the voiced form of German <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>, and equivalent to the Modern Greek medial gamma, and may be produced by driving voiced breath over the tongue set nearly in the position for English <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The sound <hi rend="italic">d</hi> lies between English <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">then</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z (ž) </hi> in <hi rend="italic">azure.</hi> Finally, <seg lang="la">b</seg> may be produced by pronouncing English <hi rend="italic">v</hi> with the two lips instead of with the under lip and upper teeth. These three spirants, <seg lang="la">g, d, b</seg>, became quite generally changed to voiced explosives or mediae (<seg lang="la">g, d, b</seg>) in the West Germanic dialects (i. e. all except Scandinavian and Gothic), though the spirants <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <seg lang="la">b (v)</seg> remained medially in all but the High German dialects; contrast Eng. <seg lang="la">la<hi rend="bold">y,</hi> da<hi rend="bold">y</hi></seg> with <seg lang="la">Germ. le<hi rend="bold">g</hi>en, ta<hi rend="bold">g</hi></seg>, and Eng. <seg lang="la">ra<hi rend="bold">v</hi>en, ha<hi rend="bold">v</hi>e</seg> with <seg lang="la">Germ. ra<hi rend="bold">b</hi>e, ha<hi rend="bold">b</hi>en.</seg> With the understanding, therefore, that <seg lang="la">g, d, b</seg> represent sometimes spirants and sometimes explosives we may set the formula, Indo-European <hi rend="italic">gh, dh, bh</hi>&gt;Teutonic <seg lang="la">g, d, b.</seg> The regular correspondences in the cognate languages are as follows:

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. The High German</hi> or second shifting. This affects only a portion of the West Germanic dialects. It began in the fifth century A.D. in the extreme south, affecting most powerfully the dialects of the Lombards, Allemans, Bavarians, and Southern Franks, but losing its force as it spread towards the north (cf. Braune, <title>Paul-Braune's Beitr.</title> i. 1 foll.). The frontier between the present High German and Low German dialects is formed without any reference to the older dialectal divisions by the final halt in the shifting of the <seg lang="la">tenues.</seg> The dialects which change initial <hi rend="italic">t</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ts (z)</hi>, medial and final <hi rend="italic">t</hi> to <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, medial <hi rend="italic">p, k</hi> to <hi rend="italic">f, ch</hi> are High German, the others Low German. This frontier crosses Germany from west to east. Its course is approximately indicated by a line drawn from Aix-laChapelle through Düsseldorf, Siegen, Cassel, Magdeburg, Lübben, Fürstenberg (south of Frankfurton-the-Oder) to the Slavic language-frontier at Birnbaum on the Warthe. The most prominent features of this second shifting may be exhibited by a comparison of the sounds concerned as they at present stand in English and modern German. The English retains these sounds approximately in their original West Germanic values. The modern German as a normalized standard language occupies 
<pb n="752" /><cb />
 in its adoption of the results of shifting a middle position between the south German dialects which shifted most and the northern which shifted least. The second shifting affected the dentals most radically.

 <p> The measuring instrument used by land-surveyors, who were from it called <seg lang="la">gromatici.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossagrimensores">Agrimensores</ref>.</p>
 <p>The groma is represented on the gravestone of a <seg lang="la">gromaticus</seg> found some years ago at Ivrea (Rossi, <figure id="fig.00752">
<head orig="Groma. (From a gravestone at Ivrea.)">Groma. (From a gravestone at Ivrea.)</head>
</figure> <title>Groma e Squadro</title>, 1877, p. 43). The design is not in perspective, but, if allowances be made for the inexperience of the artist, it explains fairly well the nature of the instrument. Two small planks crossing one another at right angles are supported on a column or post (<seg lang="la">ferramentum</seg>). Plummets (probably four, though there are only two in the monument) are suspended from the planks to guide the operator in securing a vertical position of the column, and a horizontal for the cross-pieces. The small circles at the point of section in the drawing may represent a hole in the continuation of the column for the operator to look through, or a large hole in the cross-pieces to allow of their <cb /> being tipped up to a certain angle if necessary. The latter is the more likely, for in that case the continuation of the column would serve as a support to prevent the cross from falling. In any case it obstructs the view along the planks.</p>
 <p>The use of the instrument is obvious. It is intended to guide a surveyor in drawing real or imaginary lines at right angles to one another, more especially in fixing the <seg lang="la">cardo</seg> (or north and south line) and <seg lang="la">decumanus</seg> (or east and west line) essential to the orientation of any <seg lang="la">templum</seg> or to the laying out of a Roman camp.

 <p>He edited, with commentaries, Statius <bibl default="NO">(1653)</bibl>, Plautus <bibl default="NO">(1664)</bibl>, Livy <bibl default="NO">(1645)</bibl>, Pliny the Elder <bibl default="NO">(1669)</bibl>, Tacitus <bibl default="NO">(1672)</bibl>, the tragedies of Seneca <bibl default="NO">(1661)</bibl>, and published separately various notes upon Phaedrus, Seneca, and other authors, these being subsequently incorporated with the works of his more distinguished son. A valuable contribution to the study of numismatics is the treatise <title>De Sestertiis</title>, in four books, which appeared in 1643.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Jakob</hi>, son of the preceding, born at Deventer, October 20th, 1645. He early distinguished himself at Leyden, and in 1668 visited England, where he became intimate with Casaubon, Pocock, and Pearson. While in England he spent several months in collating a number of rare MSS. at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Soon after he declined a professorship at Deventer, and in 1671 visited France, where he made the acquaintance of some of the greatest scholars of that country. In the following year he travelled in Spain and Italy, accepting in the latter country a chair in the University of Pisa offered him by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Resigning this at the end of two years, he returned to Leyden, where he soon after accepted the professorship, which he held to the end of his life, declining several calls from foreign universities, and passing his time in congenial work, though often embroiled in literary quarrels, in which he sustained his part with extreme violence of temper and a remarkable power of vituperative scurrility. He died October 21st, 1716.</p>
 <p>His most important work is his <title>Thesaurus Antiquitatum Graecarum</title>, in thirteen vols. folio <bibl default="NO">(Leyden, 1698-1702)</bibl>, reprinted at Venice <bibl default="NO">(1732-37)</bibl>—a work modelled on the great <title>Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanarum</title> of <ref type="cross" target="crossgraevius">Graevius</ref> (q.v.).

 <p>, the distinguished historian of Greece, was born at Clay Hill in Kent, England, November 17th, 1794. Educated at the Charterhouse, he did not enter one of the universities, but connected himself with a banking-house, in which he remained for thirty-two years, devoting his leisure to literary and political pursuits. In 1823 he began the special studies necessary for an exact and critical knowledge of Greek history, and in 1846 put forth the first two volumes of the great <title>History of Greece</title>, the twelfth and last volume of which appeared in 1856 <bibl default="NO">(4th ed. London, 1872)</bibl>. It begins with the earliest period and carries on the narrative to the end of the generation contemporaneous with Alexander the Great. It is notable for its accurate geographical details, for the spirit and vigour of its passages descriptive of martial exploits, and, above all, for its obvious purpose of showing the elevating and inspiring influence of freedom upon human activity. In this last respect the history of Grote has been called a Liberal history of Greece, as that of Bishop Thirlwall is undeniably a Tory history. Each chapter is, in a way, a monograph in itself, and the work as a whole is one of the greatest masterpieces of historical research that have ever been put forth. It was followed by <title>Plato and the Other Companions of Socrates</title>, 3 vols. <bibl default="NO">(London, 1865)</bibl>; and <title>Aristotle</title>, edited by Bain and Robertson, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(London, 1872)</bibl>, forming a sort of supplement to the <title>History.</title></p>
 <p>In 1862 Grote was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of London, and in 1868 President of the Council of University College. In 1869 a peerage was offered him by Mr. Gladstone, but was declined. Grote died June 18th, 1871, and was buried near Gibbon in Westminster Abbey. His life was written by his wife <bibl default="NO">(1873)</bibl>; and a good critical review of his work as an historian by Professor Bain in the remarks prefixed to the edition of Grote's minor works <bibl default="NO">(1873)</bibl>.

 <p> The name of several archaeologists of distinction. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Georg Friedrich</hi>, born at Münden in Hanover, June 9th, 1775. He was educated at Münden, Ilfeld, and the University of Göttingen. In 1797 he became master in the Göttingen Gymnasium, and soon after wrote his treatise <bibl default="NO"><title>De Pasigraphia</title> (1799)</bibl>, which led to his being made Pro-rector of the Gymnasium at Frankfort-on-theMain, and soon after Co-rector. In 1821 he was called to the rectorship of the Gymnasium at Hanover, which he held until 1849. He died December 15th, 1853.</p>
 <p>In 1823-24 Grotefend revised Wenck's Latin grammar, and followed this publication with a smaller grammar for the use of schools <bibl default="NO">(1826)</bibl>. His <title>Rudimenta Linguae Umbricae</title>, eight parts <bibl default="NO">(1835-38)</bibl>, is an attempt to explain the remains of the Umbrian dialect (see <ref type="cross" target="crossumbria">Umbria</ref>); and soon after he put forth a similar work relating to the <bibl default="NO">Oscan, <title>Rudimenta Linguae Oscae</title> (1839)</bibl>. In 1840-42 appeared, in five parts, his work <title>Zur Geographie und Geschichte von Altitalien.</title> He will, however, be longest remembered by his brilliant work in discovering a clue to the decipherment of the Persian cuneiform <cb /> inscriptions that had so long defied all attempts at elucidation. Grotefend communicated his discovery to the Royal Society of Göttingen in 1800. The points that he was the first to establish were (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) that the Persian inscriptions contain three different varieties of cuneiform, so that the decipherment of one would give a clue to the decipherment of the others; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) that the characters of the Persian cuneiform are alphabetic and not syllabic; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that they must be read from left to right; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that the alphabet consists of forty letters, including the signs for long and short vowels. These discoveries laid a solid basis for the work of those who followed and who finally solved the remaining problems. The details of the methods that led to his discoveries are given by Grotefend in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Neue Beiträge zur Erläuterung der persepolitanischen Keilinschrift</title> (1837)</bibl>; and <bibl default="NO"><title>Neue Beiträge zur Erläuterung der babylonischen Keilinschrift</title> (1840)</bibl>.

 <p> <hi rend="SmallCaps">Hugo (Huig van Groot)</hi>. A Dutch scholar and jurist of great distinction, born at Delft, April 10th, 1583. As a boy he was extraordinarily precocious, entering the University of Leyden in his eleventh year, having already become well known for his skill in Latin versification. At Leyden he studied under Joseph JustusScaliger, and when only fifteen years of age edited the very difficult, and, in fact, encyclopaedic, work of Martianus Capella <bibl default="NO">(Leyden, 1599)</bibl>. After a year spent in travel, he was admitted to the doctorate in law, and entered upon regular practice as an advocate. Though unusually successful in his chosen profession, he still reverted to letters, and in 1600 edited the remains of Aratus with the versions of Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus. He also wrote much excellent Latin verse, and three dramas in Latin, one of which (<title>Adamus Exul</title>) is thought to have furnished a number of suggestions to Milton for his <title>Paradise Lost.</title> In 1614 he edited the <title>Pharsalia</title> of Lucan, of which edition a recension was published by Usener at Greifswald in 1862. Later, he put forth an edition of Silius Italicus, and a celebrated translation of the <title>Anthologia Graeca Planudea.</title> In 1657 he composed <title>Annales et Historiae de Rebus Belgicis</title>, an historical work of much value, and recalling by its terse and pointed style the Latinity of Tacitus. He is best known to the world at large, however, by his remarkable treatise <bibl default="NO"><title>De Iure Pacis et Belli</title> (1625)</bibl>—a work of profound and searching scholarship, which long remained the standard authority on international law. To describe his stormy career as a theologian and statesman would be beyond the scope of the present work. He died at Rostock, August 29th, 1645.</p>
 <p>Few men have shown so great an aptitude for so many fields of intellectual labour. He was profoundly learned as a classical scholar, uniting elegance to accuracy. As a theologian he was probably the most soundly critical exegete of his age.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γύγης</foreign>). A Lydian, to whom Candaules, king of the country, showed his wife with her person exposed. The latter, having discovered this, was so incensed, although she concealed her anger at the time, that, calling Gyges afterwards into her presence, she gave him his choice either to submit to instant death, or to slay her husband. Gyges chose the latter alternative, married the queen, and ascended the vacant throne, about 680 years before the Christian era. He was the first of the Mermnadae who ruled in Lydia. He reigned thirty-eight years, and distinguished himself by the presents which he made to the oracle of Delphi ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 8</bibl> foll.). The wife of Candaules above mentioned was called Nyssia, according to Hephaestion. The story of Rosamund, queen of the Lombards, as related by Gibbon, bears an exact resemblance to this of Candaules (cf. Schlosser, <title>Weltgeschichte</title>, vol. ii. pt. 1, p. 82). Plato relates a curious legend respecting this Gyges, which differs essentially from the account given by Herodotus. He makes him to have been originally one of the shepherds of Candaules, and to have descended into a chasm, formed by heavy rains and <cb /> an earthquake in the quarter where he was pasturing his flocks. In this chasm he discovered many wonderful things, and particularly a brazen horse having doors in it, through which he looked, and saw within a corpse of more than mortal size, having a golden ring on its finger. This ring he took off and reascended with it to the surface of the earth. Attending, after this, a meeting of his fellow-shepherds, who used to assemble once a month for the purpose of transmitting an account of their flocks to the king, he accidentally discovered that, when he turned the bezel of the ring inward towards himself, he became invisible, and when he turned it outward, again visible. Upon this, having caused himself to be chosen in the number of those who were sent on this occasion to the king, he murdered the monarch, with the aid of the queen, whom he previously corrupted, and ascended the throne of Lydia ( <title>De Rep.</title> ii.; cf. <title>De Off.</title> iii. 9).

Lysander sent him to Lacedaemon with the money and spoils which had been taken, the former amounting to 1500 talents (B.C. 404). But Gylippus, unable to resist the temptation, unsewed the bottom of the bags, thus leaving the seals untouched at the top, and abstracted 300 talents. His theft, however, was discovered by means of the memorandum contained in each bag, and to avoid punishment he went into voluntary exile ( <title>Nicias;</title> <bibl n="Diod.  13. 106" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.

<head orig="Gymnasium">Gymnasium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">γυμνάσιον</foreign>). Gymnastics were thought by the ancients a matter of such importance that this part of education alone occupied as much time and attention as all the others put together; and while the latter necessarily ceased at a certain period of life, gymnastics continued to be cultivated by persons of all ages. The word “gymnastics” is derived from <foreign lang="greek">γυμνός</foreign> (naked), because the persons who performed their exercises in public or private gymnasia were either entirely naked, or merely covered by the short <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The great partiality of the Greeks for gymnastic exercises was productive of infinite good. It gave to the body that healthy and beautiful development by which the Greeks excelled all other nations, and which at the same time imparted to their minds power and elasticity. The plastic art also must have found its first and chief nourishment in the gymnastic and athletic performances. Respecting the advantages of gymnastics in a medical point of view, see <ref type="cross" target="crossathletae">Athletae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmedicina">Medicina</ref>.</p>
 <p>Gymnastics, in the widest sense of the word, comprehended also the agonistic and athletic arts (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνιστική</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀθλητική</foreign>) —that is, the art of those who contended for the prizes at the great public games in Greece, and of those who made gymnastic performances their profession. In a narrower sense, however, the gymnasia had, with very few exceptions, nothing to do with the public contests, 
<pb n="756" /><cb />
 but were places of exercise for the purpose of strengthening and improving the body, or, in other words, places for physical education and training; and it is chiefly in this point of view that they will be considered in this article.</p>
 <p>Gymnastic exercises among the Greeks seem to have been as old as the Greek nation itself, as may be inferred from the fact that gymnastic contests are mentioned in many of the earliest legends of Grecian story; but they were, as might be supposed, of a rude and mostly of a warlike character. They were generally held in the open air, and in plains near a river, which afforded an opportunity for swimming and bathing. The Attic legends, indeed, referred the regulation of gymnastics to Theseus (Pausan. i. 39. 3), but according to Galen it seems to have been about the time of Clisthenes that gymnastics were reduced to a regular and complete system. Great progress, however, must have been made as early as the time of Solon, as appears from some of his laws which are mentioned below. It was about the same period that the Greek towns began to build their regular gymnasia as places of exercise for the young, with baths, and other conveniences for philosophers and all persons who sought intellectual amusements. There was probably no Greek town of any importance which did not possess its gymnasium. In many places, such as Ephesus, Hierapolis, and Alexandria in Troas, the remains of the ancient gymnasia have been discovered in modern times. The oldest remains are those of the gymnasium at Olympia, which can not be earlier than the end of the fourth century B.C. (Bötticher, <title>Olympia</title>, p. 363 foll.).</p>
 <p>Athens possessed three great gymnasia—the Lyceum (<foreign lang="greek">Λύκειον</foreign>), Cynosarges (<foreign lang="greek">Κυνόσαργες</foreign>), and the Academia (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀκαδημία</foreign>), to which, in later times, several smaller ones were added. All places of this kind were, on the whole, built on the same plan, though, from the remains, as well as from the descriptions still extant, it is evident that there were many differences in their detail. We have no detailed account of a gymnasium of the best period. The most complete description of a gymnasium <figure id="fig.00756">
<head orig="Plan of Gymnasium.">Plan of Gymnasium.</head>
</figure> <cb /> which we possess is that given by Vitruvius (v. 11), which, however, is very obscure, and at the same time defective, in so far as many parts which seem to have been essential to a gymnasium are not mentioned in it. Of the numerous plans which have been drawn, that of W. Newton, in his translation of Vitruvius, may here be given with a few alterations, although some of the details are open to criticism.</p>
 <p>The peristylium (D) in a gymnasium, which Vitruvius incorrectly calls palaestra, is in the form of a square or oblong, and is two stadia (1200 feet) in circumference. It consists of four porticoes. In three of them (A B C) spacious exedrae with seats were erected, in which philosophers, rhetoricians, and others, who delighted in intellectual conversation, might assemble. A fourth portico (E), towards the south, was double, so that the interior walk was not exposed to bad weather. The double portico contained the following apartments: The Ephebeum (F), a spacious hall with seats in the middle, and one-third longer than broad, destined for the exercises of youths. On the right is the Coryceum (G), used for exercises with the sack (<foreign lang="greek">κώρυκος</foreign>), perhaps the same room which in other cases was called Apodyterium; then came the Conisterium (H) adjoining, where the body was sprinkled with dust; and next to the Conisterium, in the returns of the portico, is the cold bath, <foreign lang="greek">λουτρόν</foreign> (I). On the left of the Ephebeum is the Elaeothesium, where persons were anointed by the aliptae (K). Adjoining the Elaeothesium is the Frigidarium (L), or more probably the Tepidarium, where there was a lukewarm bath. From thence is the entrance to the Propnigeum (M), on the returns of the portico; near which, but more inward, behind the place of the Frigidarium, is the vaulted sudatory (N), in length twice its breadth, which has on the returns the Laconicum (O) on one side, and opposite the Laconicum the hot bath (P). These are the more essential and primitive parts of a gymnasium. But in the time of Vitruvius important additions were made to it. On the outside three porticoes are built: one (Q), in passing out from the peristyle, and, on the right and left, the two stadial porticoes (R, S), of which the one (S) that faces the north is made double and of great breadth, the other (R) is single, and so designed that in the parts which encircle the walls, and which adjoin the columns, there may be margins for paths not less than ten feet; and the middle is so excavated that there may be two steps, a foot and a half in descent, to go from the margin to the plane (R), which plane should not be less in breadth than twelve feet; by this means those who walked about the margins in their apparel would not be annoyed by those who were exercising themselves. This portico is called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">ξυστός</foreign>, because in the winter season the athletae exercised themselves in these covered stadia. The <foreign lang="greek">ξυστός</foreign> had groves or plantations between the two porticoes, and walks between the trees, with seats of signine work. Adjoining the <foreign lang="greek">ξυστός</foreign> (R) and double portico (S) are the uncovered walks (U), which in Greek are called <foreign lang="greek">περιδρομίδες</foreign>, to which the athletae, in fair weather, went from the winterxystus to exercise. Beyond the xystus is the stadium (W), so large that a multitude of people might have sufficient room to behold the contests of the athletae. In this description of Vitruvius, two 
<pb n="757" /><cb />
 important parts of other Greek gymnasia (the Apodyterium and the Sphaeristerium) are not mentioned.</p>
 <p>The Greeks bestowed great care upon the outward and inward splendour of their gymnasia, and adorned them with the statues of gods, heroes, victors in the public games, and of eminent men of every class. Hermes was the tutelary deity of the gymnasia, and his statue was consequently seen in most of them.</p>
 <p>The earliest regulations which we possess concerning the gymnasia are contained in the laws of Solon. One of these laws forbade all adults to enter a gymnasium during the time that boys were taking their exercises, and at the festival of the Hermaea. The gymnasia were, according to the same law, not allowed to be opened before sunrise, and were to be shut at sunset (Lex <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> <title>c. Timarch.</title> 12). Another law of Solon excluded slaves from gymnastic exercises ( <title>c. Timarch.</title> 138; <title>Solon</title>, 1). Boys who were children of an Athenian citizen and a foreign mother (<foreign lang="greek">νόθοι</foreign>) were not admitted to any other gymnasium but the Cynosarges ( <bibl n="Plut. Them. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Them.</title>1</bibl>). Some of the laws of Solon, relating to the management and the superintendence of the gymnasia, show that he was aware of the evil consequences which these institutions might produce, unless they were regulated by the strictest rules. As we, however, find that adults also frequented the gymnasia, we must suppose that, at least as long as the laws of Solon were in force, the gymnasia were divided into different parts for persons of different ages, or that persons of different ages took their exercise at different times of the day. In the time of Plato the salutary regulations of Solon appear to have been no longer observed, and we find persons of all ages visiting the gymnasia ( <title>De Rep.</title> v. p. 452; <title>Sympos.</title> 2. 18). Athens now possessed a number of smaller gymnasia, which are sometimes called palaestrae, in which persons of all ages used to assemble, and in which even the Hermaea were celebrated by the boys, while formerly this solemnity had been kept only in the great gymnasia, and to the exclusion of all adults (  <title>Lys.</title>p. 206). These changes, and the laxity in the superintendence of these public places, caused the gymnasia to differ very little from the schools of the athletae; and it is perhaps partly owing to this circumstance that writers of this and subsequent times use the words gymnasium and palaestra indiscriminately. But K. F. Hermann (<title>Privatalt.</title> 36) seems to have proved that the gymnasium was never used for a place of training.</p>
 <p>Married as well as unmarried women were, at Athens and in all the Ionian States, excluded from the gymnasia; but at Sparta, and in some other Doric States, maidens, dressed in the short <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign>, were not only admitted as spectators, but also took part in the exercises of the youths. Married women, however, did not frequent the gymnasia.</p>
 <p>Respecting the superintendence and administration of the gymnasia at Athens, we know that Solon in his legislation thought them worthy of great attention; and the transgression of some of his laws relating to the gymnasia was punished with death. His laws mention a magistrate, called the Gymnasiarch (<foreign lang="greek">γυμνασίαρχος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">γυμνασιάρχης</foreign>), who was intrusted with the whole management of the <cb /> gymnasia, and with everything connected therewith. His office was one of the regular liturgies, like the choregia and trierarchy, and was attended with considerable expense. He had to maintain and pay the persons who were preparing themselves for the games and contests in the public festivals, to provide them with oil, and perhaps with the wrestlers' dust. It also devolved upon him to adorn the gymnasium or the place where the contests took place ( <title>De Rep. Athen.</title> 1. 13). The Gymnasiarch was a real magistrate, and invested with a kind of jurisdiction over all those who frequented or were connected with the gymnasia; and his power seems even to have extended beyond the gymnasia, for Plutarch (<title>Amator.</title> c. 9, etc.) states that he watched and controlled the conduct of the ephebi in general. He had also the power to remove from the gymnasia teachers, philosophers, and sophists, whenever he conceived that they exercised an injurious influence upon the young. Another part of his duties was to conduct the solemn games at certain great festivals, espe<figure id="fig.00757">
<head orig="Boxer. (Dresden.)">Boxer. (Dresden.)</head>
</figure> cially the torch-race (<foreign lang="greek">λαμπαδηφορία</foreign>), for which he selected the most distinguished among the ephebi of the gymnasia. The number of Gymnasiarchs was, according to Libanius on Demosthenes (<title>c. Mid.</title> p. 510) ten, one from every tribe. They seem to have undertaken their official duties in turns, but in what manner is unknown. Among the external distinctions of a Gymnasiarch were a purple cloak and white shoes ( <title>Anton.</title> 33). In early times the office of Gymnasiarch lasted for a year, but under the Roman emperors we find that sometimes they held it only for a month, so that there were twelve or thirteen Gymnasiarchs in one year. This office seems to have been considered so great an honour that even Roman generals and emperors were ambitious to hold it. Other Greek towns, like Athens, had their own Gymnasiarchs, but we do not know whether, or to what extent, their duties differed from the Athenian Gymnasiarchs. In Cyrené the office was sometimes held by women.</p>
 <p>An office which is not mentioned before the time of the Roman emperors, but was nevertheless 
<pb n="758" /><cb /> decidedly connected with the gymnasia, is that of Cosmetes. He had to arrange certain games, to register the names and keep the lists of the ephebi, and to maintain order and discipline among them. He was assisted by an Anticosmetes and two Hypocosmetae. This officer appears only after the reorganization of the gymnasia in the second century B.C., when they served also as places for intellectual instruction. See <ref type="cross" target="crosseducation">Education</ref>, p. 572.</p>
 <p>An office of very great importance, in an educational point of view, was that of the Sophronistae (<foreign lang="greek">σωφρονισταί</foreign>). Their province was to inspire the youth with a love of <foreign lang="greek">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, and to protect this virtue against all injurious influences. In early times their number at Athens was ten, one from every tribe, with a salary of one drachma per day (<title>Etym. Mag.</title> s. h. v.). Their duty not only required them to be present at all the games of the ephebi, but to watch and correct their conduct wherever they might meet them, both within and without the gymnasium.</p>
 <p>The instructions in the palaestrae, sometimes attached to gymnasia, were given by the Gymnastae (<foreign lang="greek">γυμνασταί</foreign>) and the Paedotribae (<foreign lang="greek">παιδοτρίβαι</foreign>); at a later period Hypopaedotribae were added. The Paedotribes was required to possess a knowledge of all the various exercises which were performed by the gymnasia; the Gymnastes was the superior teacher, and was expected to know the physiological effects and influences on the constitution of the youths, and therefore assigned to each of them those exercises which he thought most suitable.</p>
 <p>The anointing of the bodies of the youths, and strewing them with dust, before they commenced their exercises, as well as the regulation of their diet, was the duty of the Aliptae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaliptae">Aliptae</ref>.) These men sometimes also acted as surgeons or teachers. Galen mentions among the gymnastic teachers a <foreign lang="greek">σφαιριστικός</foreign>, or teacher of the various games at ball; and it is not improbable that in some cases particular games may have been taught by separate persons.</p>
 <p>The games and exercises which were performed in the gymnasia seem, on the whole, to have been the same throughout Greece. Among the Dorians, however, they were regarded chiefly as institutions for hardening the body and for military training; among the Ionians, and especially the Athenians, they had an additional and higher object, namely, to give to the body and its movements grace and beauty, and to make it the basis of a healthy and sound mind.</p>
 <p>Among the games we may mention: (1) The ball (<foreign lang="greek">σφαίρισις, σφαιρομαχία</foreign>, etc.), which was in universal favour, and was here, in Greece, as at Rome, played in a variety of ways, as appears from the words <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόρραξις, ἐπίσκυρος, φαινίνδα</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ἁρπαστόν</foreign>, etc. Every gymnasium contained one large room for the purpose of playing at ball in it (<foreign lang="greek">σφαιριστήριον</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Παίζειν ἑλκυστίνδα, διελκυστίνδα</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">διὰ γραμμῆς</foreign>, was a game in which one <cb /> <figure id="fig.00758">
<head orig="The Wrestlers. (Uffizi Gallery, Florence.)">The Wrestlers. (Uffizi Gallery, Florence.)</head>
</figure> boy, holding one end of a rope, tried to pull the boy who held its other end across a line marked between them on the ground.</p>
 <p>(3) The top (<foreign lang="greek">βέμβηξ, βέμβιξ, ῥομβος, στρόβιλος</foreign>), which was as common an amusement with Greek boys as in our own days.</p>
 <p>(4) The <foreign lang="greek">πεντάλιθος</foreign>, which was a game with five stones, which were thrown up from the upper part of the hand and caught in the palm.</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">Σκαπέρδα</foreign>, which was a game in which a rope was drawn through the upper part of a tree or a post. Two boys, one on each side of the post, turning their backs towards one another, took hold of the ends of the rope and tried to pull each other up. This sport was also one of the amusements at the Attic Dionysia. These few games will suffice to show the character of the gymnastic sports.</p>
 <p>The more important games, such as running (<foreign lang="greek">δρόμος</foreign>), throwing of the <foreign lang="greek">δίσκος</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">ἄκων</foreign>, jumping and leaping (<foreign lang="greek">ἅλμα</foreign>, with and without <foreign lang="greek">ἁλτῆρες</foreign>), wrestling (<foreign lang="greek">πάλη</foreign>), boxing (<foreign lang="greek">πυγμή</foreign>), the pancratium (<foreign lang="greek">παγκράτιον, πένταθλον, λαμπαδηφορία</foreign>), dancing (<foreign lang="greek">ὄρχησις</foreign>), etc., are described in separate articles.</p>
 <p>A gymnasium was, as Vitruvius observes, not a Roman institution, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (<title>Ant. Rom.</title> vii. 70-72) expressly states that the whole <foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνιστική</foreign> of the Romans, though it was practised at an early period in the Ludi Maximi, was introduced among the Romans from Greece. Their attention, however, to developing and strengthening the body by exercises was considerable, though only for military purposes. The regular training of boys in the Greek gymnastics was foreign to Roman manners, and even held in contempt ( <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 40). Towards the end of the Republic many wealthy Romans, who had acquired a taste for Greek manners, used to attach to their villas small places for bodily exercise, sometimes called gymnasia, sometimes palaestrae, and to adorn them with beautiful works of art. The emperor Nero was the first who built a public 
<pb n="759" /><cb />
 gymnasium at Rome ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 12" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>12</bibl>); another was erected by Commodus (Herodian, i. 12, 4). But although these institutions were intended to introduce Greek gymnastics among the Romans, yet they never gained any great importance, as the magnificent thermae, amphitheatres, and other colossal buildings had always greater charms for the Romans than the gymnasia.</p>

It was only after the expedition of the Ten Thousand that they came to form an essential part of a Greek army. They were generally recruited from the barbarous nations who were specially distinguished in the use of particular missiles. The archers (<foreign lang="greek">τοξόται</foreign>), for instance, were generally Cretans, the slingers (<foreign lang="greek">σφενδονῆται</foreign>) Rhodians and Thessalians, while the javelin men (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκοντισταί</foreign>) were taken from the semiHellenic populations in the west of Greece, notably the Aetolians and Acarnanians. The common characteristic of all these troops was the absence of all defensive weapons. It was among the Lacedaemonians that they were introduced latest. Alexander the Great had a corps of 2000 of them, with which he opened his campaign against the Persians. Half of these were spearmen and the other half archers.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Γυμνοσοφισταί</foreign>). “Naked Sages.” A name given by the Greek writers to a certain class of Indian ascetics belonging to the caste of the Brahmins, and who, in accordance with the prevalent belief, thought that, by subjecting <cb /> the body to sufferings and privations, and by withdrawing from all intercourse with mankind, they could effect a reunion of the spiritual nature of man with the divine essence. Most of these ascetics dispensed almost entirely with the use of clothes, and many of them went entirely naked. Hence the name applied to them by the Greeks. Many of these hermits appear in former times to have studied the abstract sciences with great success, and they have always been considered by the orthodox Hindus as the wisest and holiest of mankind. The Gymnosophists often burned themselves alive, as Calanus did in the presence of Alexander (Arrian, <bibl n="Xen.

At Sparta there were <foreign lang="greek">παιδονόμοι</foreign>, but not <foreign lang="greek">γυναικονόμοι</foreign>.

We find them at Chaeronea, Syracuse, Andania, and at Gambreion near Pergamum.</p>
 <p>They were associated with the Areopagus in the maintenance of public decency and the enforcement of sumptuary laws.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
