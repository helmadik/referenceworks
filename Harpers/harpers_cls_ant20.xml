<head orig="Taberna">Taberna</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σκηναί, γέρρα</foreign>). (1) A shop. It was so named because in Rome the shops consisted for the most part of boarded stalls projecting from the houses or raised under the colonnades which surrounded the market-places. Subsequently, however, as wealth and commerce increased, the groundstory of the rows of houses, and even palaces, in a street were appropriated for shops and let out to separate tradesmen, as in many of the great mansions in Continental towns. In the majority of cases the shop had no communication with the rest of the house, the tenant merely occupying it for the purpose of his business and dwelling himself elsewhere; but some few houses of a respectable class have been discovered at Pompeii in which the shop has an entrance from its back into the habitable parts of the mansion, and these are reasonably believed to have been in the occupancy of the persons who dwelt on the premises, and who <figure id="fig.01518">
<head orig="Roman Shop. (Pompeian painting.)">Roman Shop. (Pompeian painting.)</head>
</figure> are, in consequence, supposed to have been wealthy tradesmen. The general appearance of a Roman shop, as uniformly exhibited by the numerous examples remaining at Pompeii, resembled those of our butchers and fish-dealers, being entirely open in front with the exception of a low wall forming the counter, and were closed by wooden shutters at night. They are mostly comprised in a single room, without any other convenience; though in some instances a small back parlour and other appurtenances are added. The annexed illustration represents an elevation restored of six shop-fronts at Pompeii. <figure id="fig.01518.2">

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κλισίη, σκηνή</foreign>). (1) A tent. The first of these words was originally a hut made of boards (<seg lang="la">tabulae</seg>). Tents were regularly made of skins stretched on wooden supports, like our canvas tents; whence the name <seg lang="la">tentorium.</seg> In summer the soldiers slept in tents (<seg lang="la">sub pellibus durare</seg>, <bibl n="Liv.  5. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, v. 2</bibl>), but in winter they were lodged either in towns or, if in camp, in huts of stone or turf.

 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crosstacitus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tacĭtus">Tacitus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Publius Cornelius</hi>. (The praenomen, Publius, is given in the best MS. [Med. I.]; and in an inscription.) One of the greatest of the Roman writers of history. The time and place of his birth are unknown. He was a little older than the younger Pliny , who was born A.D. 61. His father was probably Cornelius Tacitus, a Roman <seg lang="la">eques</seg>, who is mentioned as a procurator in Gallia Belgica, and who died in 79 (Pliny , <title>Epist.</title> vii. 76). Tacitus was first promoted by the emperor Vespasian, and he received other favours from both Titus and Domitian ( <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 1</bibl>). The <cb /> most probable account is that Tacitus was appointed <seg lang="la">tribunus militum laticlavius</seg> by Vespasian, quaestor by Titus, and praetor by Domitian. In 78 he married the daughter of the famous general, C. Iulius Agricola, to whom he had been betrothed in the preceding year, while Agricola was consul. In the reign of Domitian, and in 88, Tacitus was praetor, and he assisted as one of the quindecimviri at the Ludi Saeculares which were celebrated in that year ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 11. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>xi. 11</bibl>). Agricola died at Rome in 93, but neither Tacitus nor the daughter of Agricola was then with him. It is not known where Tacitus was during the last illness of Agricola. In the reign of <bibl n="Nerva  97" default="NO">Nerva, 97</bibl>, Tacitus was appointed consul suffectus, in the place of T. Virginius Rufus, who had died in that year, and whose funeral oration he delivered. We know that Tacitus had attained oratorical distinction when the younger Pliny was commencing his career. He and Tacitus were appointed in the reign of Nerva (99) to conduct the prosecution of Marius, proconsul of Africa. Tacitus and Pliny were most intimate friends. In the collection of the letters of Pliny there are eleven letters addressed to Tacitus. The time of the death of Tacitus is unknown, but he appears to have survived Trajan, who died 117. Nothing is recorded of any children of his, though the Emperor Tacitus claimed a descent from the historian, and ordered his works to be placed in all public libraries. The following are the extant works of Tacitus: <title>(a) Vita Agricolae</title>, the life of Agricola, which was written after the death of Domitian (96), as we may probably conclude from the introduction, which was certainly written after Trajan's accession. This life is justly admired as a specimen of biography. It is a monument to the memory of a noble man and an able commander and administrator, by an affectionate sonin-law, who has portrayed, in his peculiar manner and with many masterly touches, the virtues of one of the most illustrious of the Romans. <title>(b) Historiae</title>, which were written after the death of Nerva (98) and before the <title>Annales.</title> They comprehended the period from the second consulship of Galba (68) to the death of Domitian (96), and the author designed to add the reigns of Nerva and Trajan. The first four books alone are extant in a complete form, and they comprehend only the events of about one year. The fifth book is imperfect, and goes no further than the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, and the war of Civilis in Germany. It is not known how many books of the <title>Historiae</title> there were, but it must have been a large work if it was all written on the same scale as the first five books. <title>(c) Annales</title>, which commence with the death of Augustus</p>
 <p>(14), hence <title>ab excessu divi Augusti</title>, and comprise the period to the death of Nero (68)—a space of fifty-four years. The greater part of the fifth book is lost, and also the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, the beginning of the eleventh, and the end of the sixteenth, which is the last book. These lost parts comprised the whole of Caligula's reign, the first five years of Claudius, and the last two of Nero. <title>(d) De Moribus et Populis Germaniae</title>, usually called the <title>Germania</title>, a treatise describing the Germanic nations. It is of little value as a geographical description; the first few chapters contain as much of the geography of Germany as Tacitus knew. The main subject is the description of the political institutions, the religion, and the habits of the 
<pb n="1520" /><cb />
 various tribes included under the name Germani. The value of the information contained in this treatise has often been discussed, and its credibility attacked; but we may estimate its true character by observing the precision of the writer as to those Germans who were best known to the Romans from being near the Rhine. That the hearsay accounts of more remote tribes must partake of the defects of all such evidence is obvious; and we cannot easily tell whether Tacitus embellished that which he had heard obscurely told. But to consider the Germany as a fiction, or as a purely political tract, is one of those absurdities which need only be recorded, not refuted. <title>(e) Dialogus de Oratoribus.</title> If this dialogue is the work of Tacitus, and it probably is, it must be his earliest work, for it was written in the sixth year of Vespasian. The style is more easy than that of the <title>Annales</title>—more diffuse, less condensed; but there is an obvious difference between the style of the <title>Dialogus</title> and the <title>Historiae</title>—nothing so striking as to make us contend for a different authorship. Besides this, it is nothing unusual for works of the same author, which are written at different times, to vary greatly in style, especially if they treat of different matters. The oldest MSS. also attribute the <title>Dialogus</title> to Tacitus. (See Gudeman's introduction to his edition of the work.) The treatise is an essay, in the form of a dialogue, giving an account of the decay of oratory under the Empire.</p>
 <p>The <title>Annales</title> of Tacitus, the work of a mature age, contain the chief events of the period which they embrace, arranged under their several years. There seems no peculiar propriety in giving the name of <title>Annales</title> to this work, simply because the events are arranged in the order of time. In the <title>Annales</title> of Tacitus, the Princeps or Emperor is the centre about which events are grouped. Yet the most important public events, both in Italy and the provinces, are not omitted, though everything is treated as subordinate to the exhibition of imperial power. The <title>Historiae</title>, which were written before the <title>Annales</title>, are in a more diffuse style, and the treatment of the extant part is different from that of the <title>Annales.</title> Tacitus wrote the <title>Historiae</title> as a contemporary; the <title>Annales</title> as not a contemporary. They are two distinct works, not parts of one, which is clearly shown by the very different proportions of the two works: the first four books of the <title>Historiae</title> comprise about a year, and the first four books of the <title>Annales</title> comprise fourteen years.</p>
 <p>The moral dignity of Tacitus is impressed upon his works; the consciousness of a love of truth, of the integrity of his purpose. His great power is in the knowledge of the human mind, his insight into the motives of human conduct; and he found materials for its exercise in the history of the emperors, and particularly Tiberius, whose strange career and enigmatical personality fascinated him. The <title>Annales</title> are filled with dramatic scenes and striking catastrophes. He laboured to produce effect by the exhibition of great personages on the stage; but as to the mass of the people we learn little from Tacitus. The style of Tacitns is peculiar, though it bears some resemblance to In the <title>Annales</title> it is concise, vigorous, and pregnant with meaning; laboured, but elaborated with art, and stripped of every superfluity. A single word sometimes gives effect to a sentence; and if the meaning of the word is missed, the sense of the <cb /> writer is not reached. Such a work is probably the result of many transcriptions by the author. Tacitus is generally brief and rapid in his sketches; but he is sometimes almost too minute when he comes to work out a dramatic scene; and he displays all the conscious rhetoric of his age. The condensed style of Tacitus sometimes makes him obscure, but it is a kind of obscurity that is dispelled by careful reading. Yet a man must read carefully and often, in order to understand him; and it cannot be supposed that Tacitus was ever a popular writer. He is often intensely epigrammatic, and exhibits the qualities of style that are found in the typical writers of the Silver Age. Many of his pregnant phrases have passed into the world's anthology of quotations, such as <title>Omne ignotum pro magnifico</title> and <title>Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</title> In his view of the condition of Roman society he is thoroughly pessimistic, and by contemplating only one section of it he is led into an unconscious exaggeration which the reader should correct by the reading of the contemporary and friend of Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, whose more pleasing picture of the time is a wholesome check upon any too sweeping condemnation of the imperial period of Rome's social history.</p>
 <p>The manuscripts of Tacitus are few and unsatisfactory. For the first six books of the <title>Annales</title> only one source exists—the Codex Mediceus (I.) of the ninth century, and found about 1520. From this bks. vii.-ix. are lost, as are <title>Historiae</title> v.-xiv. For what remains of these, a second Codex Mediceus (II.) of the eleventh or twelfth century is the only authority. The <title>Germania</title> and <title>Dialogus</title> are found in two manuscripts—one at Leyden (Codex Leidensis [Perizonianus]), and the other in the Vatican. The <title>Agricola</title> is found in two transcriptions of an earlier MS. Both of these are in the Vatican. On the codices of Tacitus, see the introduction to the edition of the <title>Dialogus</title> by Michaelis <bibl default="NO">(1868)</bibl>, and Gudeman <bibl default="NO">(1894)</bibl>, and in Ritter's edition <bibl default="NO">(1864)</bibl>.</p>

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Claudius</hi>. A Roman emperor, who ruled from the 25th September, A.D. 275, until April, A.D. 276. He was elected by the Senate after the death of Aurelian, the army having requested the Senate to nominate a successor to the imperial throne. Tacitus was at the time seventy years of age, and was with difficulty persuaded to accept the purple. The high character which he had borne before his elevation to the throne he amply sustained during his brief reign. He endeavoured to repress the luxury and licentiousness of the age by various sumptuary laws, and he himself set an example to all around by the abstemiousness, simplicity, and frugality of his own habits. The only military achievement of this reign was the defeat and expulsion from Asia Minor of a party of Goths who had carried their devastation across the peninsula to the confines of Cilicia. He died either at Tarsus or at Tyana, about the 9th of April, 276. His life is given in the <title>Historia Augusta.</title>

In the language of anatomists it is still called <seg lang="la">astragalus;</seg> the English name is sometimes “huckle-bone,” but more commonly “knuckle-bone.” The astragali of sheep and goats, from their peculiar squareness and

 smoothness, have been used as playthings from the earliest times, and have often been found in Greek and Roman tombs, both natural and imitated in ivory, bronze, glass, and agate (Propert. iii. 24, 13; <bibl n="Mart.  14. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 14</bibl>). They were used to play with, prin<figure id="fig.01522">

</figure> cipally by women and children ( <title>Alcib.</title> 2), occasionally by old men ( <title>de Sen.</title> 16. 58).</p>
 <p>To play at this game was sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">πεντελιθίζειν</foreign>, because five bones or other objects of a similar kind were employed ( <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 33" default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>33</bibl>M.); and this number is retained among ourselves. This game was entirely one of skill; and in ancient no less than in modern times it consisted not merely in catching the five bones on the back of the hand, as shown in the woodcut, but in a great variety of exercises requiring quickness, agility, and accuracy of sight.</p>
 <p>The name was also given to dice (cf. our slang term “the bones”) for playing games of chance (see <ref type="cross" target="crossalea">Alea</ref>). The length was greater than the breadth, so that they had four long sides and two pointed ends, one of them called <foreign lang="greek">κεραία</foreign>, the other without a name. Of the four long sides, which alone were marked, two were broader, the others narrower. One of the broad sides was convex (<foreign lang="greek">πρηνής</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πρανής</foreign>, the other concave (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπτία</foreign>); while of the narrow sides one was flat and called <foreign lang="greek">χῖον</foreign>, the other indented. This was called <foreign lang="greek">κῷον</foreign>, and, as <figure id="fig.01522.2">
<head orig="Roman Dicebox. (Rich.)">Roman Dicebox. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> the rarest was also the luckiest throw, marked 6: the <foreign lang="greek">χῖον</foreign> was marked 1, the broader sides 3 and 4, so that the numbers 2 and 5 were wanting. From the difference of their shapes they did not absolutely require to be marked, and sometimes the pips were dispensed with. It was the under side of the die, not the upper, that counted, as must be inferred from the fact of the narrowest side giving the highest throw (Marquardt, <title>Privatl.</title> 828).</p>
 <p>The Greek and Latin names of the numbers were as follows:—1. <foreign lang="greek">Μονάς, εἷς, κύων, Χῖος</foreign>: <title>Unio, Volturius, canis;</title> 3. <foreign lang="greek">Τριάς</foreign>: <title>Ternio;</title> 4. <foreign lang="greek">Τετράς</foreign>: <title>Quaternio;</title> 6. <foreign lang="greek">Ἑξάς, ἑξίτης, Κῷος</foreign>: <title>Senio.</title></p>
 <p>As the bone is broader in one direction than in the other, it was said to fall upright or prone (<foreign lang="greek">ὀρθὸς ἢ πρηνής</foreign>, <seg lang="la">rectus aut pronus</seg>), according as it rested on a narrow or a broad side.</p>
 <p>Two persons played together at this game, using four bones, which they threw up into the air, or emptied out of a dice-box (<foreign lang="greek">φιμός</foreign>, <seg lang="la">fritillus</seg>). The numbers on the four sides of the four bones admitted of thirty-five different combinations. The lowest throw of all was four aces. But the value of a throw (<foreign lang="greek">βόλος</foreign>, <seg lang="la">iactus</seg>) was not in all cases the sum of the four numbers turned up. The highest in value was that called <title>Venus, or iactus Venereus</title>, in which the numbers cast up were all different ( <bibl n="Mart.  14. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xiv. 14</bibl>), the sum of them being only fourteen. It was by obtaining this throw that the master of revels (<seg lang="la">arbiter bibendi</seg>) was chosen at <cb /> the drinking-bouts.

<div2 id="crosstantalus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tantălus">Tantalus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τάνταλος</foreign>). (1) The son of Zeus and Pluto. His wife is called by some Euryanassa, by others Taÿgeté or Dioné, and by others Clytia or Eupryto. He was the father of Pelops, Broteas, and Niobé. All traditions agree in stating that he was a wealthy king, but while some call him king of Lydia, others describe him as king of Argos or Corinth. Tantalus is particularly celebrated in ancient story for the terrible punishment inflicted upon him after his death in the lower world, the causes of which are differently stated by the ancient writers. According to the common account Zeus invited him to his table, and communicated his divine counsels to him. Tantalus divulged the secrets thus intrusted to him; and he was punished in the lower world by being afflicted with a raging thirst, and at the same time placed in the midst of a lake, the waters of which always receded from him as soon as he attempted to drink them. Over his head, moreover, hung branches of fruit, which receded in like manner when he stretched out his hand to reach them. (Ovid. <bibl n="Ov. Met. 4. 457" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>iv. 457</bibl>;  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 1" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 68" default="NO"> Sat., 68</bibl>; Hygin. <bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 82" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fab.</title>82</bibl>). Another account says that there was suspended over his head a huge rock, ever threatening to crush him ( <bibl n="Phleg. Olymp. 1. 56" default="NO"> <title>Olymp.</title>i. 56</bibl>). Another tradition relates that, wishing to test the gods, he cut his son Pelops in pieces, boiled them and set them before the gods at a repast. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspelops">Pelops</ref>.) A third account states that Tantalus stole nectar and ambrosia from the table of the gods and gave them to his friends ( <bibl n="Phleg. Olymp. 1. 60" default="NO"> <title>Olymp.</title>i. 60</bibl>); and a fourth relates the following story: Rhea caused the infant Zeus and his nurse to be guarded in Crete by a golden dog, whom Zeus afterwards appointed guardian of his temple in Crete. Pandareus stole this dog, and, carrying him to Mount Sipylus in Lydia, gave him to Tantalus to take care of. But when Pandareus demanded the dog back, Tantalus took an oath that he had never received it. Zeus thereupon changed Pandareus into a stone, and threw Tantalus down from Mount Sipylus. Others, again, relate that Hermes demanded the dog of Tantalus, and that the perjury was committed before Hermes. Zeus buried Tantalus under Mount Sipylus as a punishment; and there his tomb was shown in later times. The punishment of Tautalus was proverbial in ancient times, and from it the English language has borrowed

 the verb “to tantalize,” that is, to hold out hopes or prospects which cannot be realized. The patronymic Tantalides is frequently given to the descendants of Tantalus. Hence we find not only his son Pelops, but also Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Menelaüs, and Orestes called by this name.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of Thyestes, who was killed by Atreus. Others call him a son of Broteas. He was married to Clytaemnestra before Agamemnon, and is said by some to have been killed by Agamemnon.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τάρας</foreign>). Now Taranto; a Greek city on the western coast of Calabria in Italy with an excellent harbour, which formed a part of the Sinus Tarentinus. The surrounding country was both fertile and picturesque. Tarentum was traditionally said to have been built by the Iapygians, mingled with colonists from Crete, and to have derived its name from Taras, a son of Poseidon (Pausan. x. 10, 6). Its importance dates from the year B.C. 708, when it was captured by a body of Lacedaemonians under Phalanthus (see the article <ref type="cross" target="crosspartheniae">Partheniae</ref>), after which it became a flourishing place, holding a sort of suzerainty over the rest of the cities of Magna Graecia. Its commerce was extensive; it had a powerful fleet; and could bring into the field an army of 30,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, including the forces of its allies; its own troops numbered 22,000 men. <figure id="fig.01524">

 <p>Its government was different at different periods of its history. At the time of Darius Hystaspis it was ruled by kings; but later it became a democracy. Its later law-code was the work of Archytas, who flourished about B.C. 400. As its wealth increased, its people became luxurious and effeminate; and being attacked by the neighbouring Lucanians, it appealed to Sparta for help. In answer to this appeal Archidamus, son of Agesilaüs, came to their assistance in B.C. 338; and he fell in battle fighting on their behalf. The next prince whom they invited to succour them was Alexander, king of Epirus, and uncle to Alexander the Great. At first he met with considerable success, but was eventually defeated and slain by the Bruttii in 326 near Pandosia on the banks of the Acheron. Shortly afterwards the Tarentines had to encounter a still more formidable enemy. Having attacked some Roman ships, and then grossly insulted the Roman ambassadors who had been sent to demand reparation, war was declared against the city by the powerful Republic. The Tarentines were saved for a time by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspyrrhus">Pyrrhus</ref>), who came to their help in 281; but two years after the defeat of this monarch and his withdrawal from Italy, the city was taken by the Romans (272). In the Second Punic War Tarentum revolted from Rome to Hannibal (212); but it was retaken by the Romans in 207. and was treated by them with great severity, From this time Tarentum declined in prosperity and wealth. It was subsequently made a Roman colony, and it still continued to be a place of considerable importance in the time of Augustus ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 10</bibl>). Its inhabitants retained their love of luxury and ease; and it is described by Horace as <title>molle Tarentum</title> and <title>imbelle Tarentum.</title> Even after the downfall of the Western Empire the Greek language was still spoken at Tarentum; and it was long one of the chief strongholds of the Byzantine Empire in the south of Italy. 
<pb n="1525" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The town of Tarentum consisted of two parts, viz.: a peninsula or island at the entrance of the harbour, and a town on the mainland, which was connected with the island by means of a bridge. On the northwest corner of the island, close to the entrance of the harbour, was the citadel: the principal part of the town was situated southwest of the isthmus. The modern town is confined to the island or peninsula on which the citadel stood. The neighbourhood of Tarentum produced the best wool in all Italy, and was also celebrated for its excellent wine, figs, pears, and other fruits. Its purple dye was also much valued in antiquity. On the history of the place, see the works by Döhle <bibl default="NO">(1877)</bibl> and De Vincentis (1878 foll.); and on the topography, that by Gagliardo <bibl default="NO">(Taranto, 1886)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crosstarquinius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tarquinius">Tarquinius</head>

 <p> ( <title>Tarcho</title>). The name of a family in early Roman tradition to which the fifth and seventh kings of Rome belonged. The legend of the Tarquins ran as follows: Demaratus, their ancestor, belonged to the noble family of the Bacchiadae at Corinth, and fled from his native city when the power of his order was overthrown by Cypselus. He settled at Tarquinii in Etruria, <cb /> where he had mercantile connections. He married an Etruscan wife, by whom he had two sons, Lucumo and Aruns. The latter died in the lifetime of his father, leaving his wife pregnant; but as Demaratus was ignorant of this circumstance, he bequeathed all his property to Lucumo, and died himself shortly afterwards. But, although Lucumo was thus one of the most wealthy persons at Tarquinii, and had married Tanaquil, who belonged to a family of the highest rank, he was excluded, as a stranger, from all power and influence in the State. Discontented with this inferior position, and urged on by his wife, he resolved to leave Tarquinii and remove to Rome. He accordingly set out for Rome, riding in a chariot with his wife, and accompanied by a large train of followers. When they had reached the Ianiculum, an eagle seized his cap, and after carrying it away to a great height placed it again upon his head. Tanaquil, who was skilled in the Etruscan science of augury, bade her husband hope for the highest honour from this omen. Her predictions were soon verified. The stranger was received with welcome, and he and his followers were admitted to the rights of Roman citizens. He took the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Tarquinius</hi>, to which Livy adds <ref type="cross" target="crosspriscus">Priscus</ref>. His wealth, his courage, and his wisdom gained him the love both of Ancus Marcius and of the people. The former appointed him guardian of his children; and, when he died, the Senate and the people unanimously elected Tarquinius to the vacant throne. The reign of Tarquinius was distinguished by great exploits in war and by great works in peace. He defeated the Latins and Sabines; and the latter people ceded to him the town of Collatia, where he placed a garrison under the command of Egerius, the son of his deceased brother Aruns, who took the surname of Collatinus. Some traditions relate that Tarquinius defeated the Etruscans also. Among the important works which Tarquinius executed in peace, the most celebrated are the vast sewers by which the lower parts of the city were drained, and which still remain, with not a stone displaced, to bear witness to his power and wealth. He is also said in some traditions to have laid out the Circus Maximus in the valley which had been redeemed from water by the sewers, and also to have instituted the Great or Roman Games, which were henceforth performed in the Circus. The Forum, with its porticoes and rows of shops, was also his work, and he likewise began to surround the city with a stone wall, a work which was finished by his successor, Servius Tullius. The building of the Capitoline Temple is, moreover, attributed to the elder Tarquinius, though most traditions ascribe this work to his son, and only the vow to the father. Tarquinius also made some changes in the constitution of the State. He added one hundred new members to the Senate, who were called <seg lang="la">patres minorum gentium</seg>, to distinguish them from the old senators, who were now called <seg lang="la">patres maiorum gentium.</seg> He wished to add to the three centuries of equites established by Romulus three new centuries, and to call them after himself and two of his friends. His plan was opposed by the augur Attus Navius, who gave a convincing proof that the gods were opposed to his purpose. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnavius">Navius</ref>.) Accordingly, he gave up his design of establishing new centuries, but to each of the former 
<pb n="1526" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01526">

</figure>
 centuries he associated another under the same name, so that henceforth there were the first and second Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres. He increased the number of Vestal Virgins from four to six. Tarquinius was murdered, after a reign of thirty-eight years, at the instigation of the sons of Ancus Marcius. But the latter did not secure the reward of their crime, for Servius Tullius, with the assistance of Tanaquil, succeeded to the vacant throne (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 34</bibl>-41). Tarquinius left two sons and two daughters. His two sons, L. Tarquinius and Aruns, were subsequently married to the two daughters of Servius Tullius. One of his daughters was married to Servius Tullius, and the other to M. Brutus, by whom she became the mother of the celebrated L. Brutus, the first consul at Rome. Servius Tullius, whose life is given under <ref type="cross" target="crosstullius">Tullius</ref>, was murdered, after a reign of forty-four years, by his son-in-law, L. Tarquinius, who ascended the vacant throne.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Tarquinius Superbus</hi> commenced his reign without any of the forms of election. One of the first acts of his reign was to abolish the rights which had been conferred upon the plebeians by Servius; and at the same time all the senators and patricians whom he mistrusted or whose wealth he coveted were put to death or driven into exile. He surrounded himself by a body-guard, by means of which he was enabled to do what he liked. His cruelty and tyranny obtained for him the surname of <title>Superbus.</title> But although a tyrant at home, he raised Rome to great influence and power among the surrounding nations. He gave his daughter in marriage to Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, the most powerful of the Latin chiefs; and under his sway Rome became the head of the Latin Confederacy. He defeated the Volscians, and took the wealthy town of Suessa Pometia, with the spoils of which he commenced the erection of the Capitol which his father had vowed. In the vaults of this temple he deposited the Sibylline Books, which the king purchased from a Sibyl or prophetess. She had offered to sell him nine books for 300 pieces of gold. The king refused the offer with scorn. Therefore she went away and burned three, and then demanded the same price for the six. The king still refused. She again went away and burned three more, and still demanded the same price for the remaining three. The king now purchased the three books, and the Sibyl disappeared. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibylla</ref>.) He next engaged in war with <cb /> Gabii, one of the Latin cities, which refused to enter into the league. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquinius had recourse to stratagem. His son, Sextus, pretending to be ill-treated by his father, and covered with the bloody marks of stripes, fled to Gabii. The infatuated inhabitants intrusted him with the command of their troops; whereupon he sent a messenger to his father to inquire how he should deliver the city into his hands. The king, who was walking in his garden when the messenger arrived, made no reply, but kept striking off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick. Sextus took the hint. He put to death or banished all the leading men of the place, and then had no difficulty in compelling it to submit to his father.</p>
 <p>In the midst of his prosperity, Tarquinius fell through a shameful outrage committed by one of his sons. Tarquinius and his sons were engaged in besieging Ardea, a city of the Rutulians. Here, as the king's sons, and their cousin, Tarquinius Collatinus, the son of Egerius, were feasting together, a dispute arose about the virtue of their wives. As nothing was doing in the field, they mounted their horses to visit their homes by surprise. They first went to Rome, where they surprised the king's daughters at a splendid banquet. They then hastened to Collatia, and there, though it was late in the night, they found Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, spinning amid her handmaids. The beauty and virtue of Lucretia had fired the evil passions of Sextus. A few days afterwards he returned to Collatia, where he was hospitably received by Lucretia as her husband's kinsman. In the dead of night he entered the chamber with a drawn sword: by threatening to lay a slave with his throat cut beside her, whom he would pretend to have killed in order to avenge her husband's honour, he forced her to yield to his wishes. As soon as Sextus had departed, Lucretia sent for her husband and father. Collatinus came, accompanied by L. Brutus; Lucretius, with P. Valerius, who afterwards gained the surname of Publicola. They found her in an agony of sorrow. She told them what had happened, enjoined them to avenge her dishonour, and then stabbed herself to death. They all swore to avenge her. Brutus threw off his assumed stupidity, and placed himself at their head. They carried the corpse to Rome. Brutus, who was <seg lang="la">tribunus celerum</seg>, summoned the people, and related the deed of shame. All classes were inflamed with the same indignation. A decree was passed deposing the king, and banishing him and his family from the city. The army, encamped before Ardea, likewise renounced their allegiance to the tyrant. Tarquinius, with his two sons, Titus and Aruns, took refuge at Caeré in Etruria. Sextus repaired to Gabii, his own principality, where he was shortly after murdered by the friends of those whom he had put to death. Tarquinius reigned twenty-four years. He was banished B.C. 510. The people of Tarquinii and Veii espoused the cause of the exiled tyrant, and marched against Rome. The two consuls advanced to meet them. A bloody battle was fought, in which Brutus and Aruns, the son of Tarquinius, slew each other. Tarquinius next repaired to Lars Porsena, the powerful king of Clusium, 
<pb n="1527" /><cb />
 who marched against Rome at the head of a vast army. The history of this expedition is related under <ref type="cross" target="crossporsena">Porsena</ref>. After Porsena quitted Rome, Tarquinius took refuge with his son-in-law, Mamilius Octavius of Tusculum. Under the guidance of the latter, the Latin States espoused the cause of the exiled king, and declared war against Rome. The contest was decided by the celebrated battle of Lake Regillus, in which the Romans gained the victory by the help of Castor and Pollux. Tarquinius himself was wounded, but escaped with his life; his son Sextus is said to have fallen in this battle, though, according to another tradition, as we have already seen, he was slain by the inhabitants of Gabii. Tarquinius Superbus had now no other State to whom he could apply for assistance. He had already survived all his family; and he now fled to Aristobulus at Cumae, where he died a wretched and remorseful old man (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 121" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 121</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Such is the story of the Tarquins according to the ancient writers; but this story must not be received as a real history. It is the attempt to assign a definite origin to certain Roman institutions, to some features in the military organization, and to some ancient public works in the city, of which the history had been obscured by lapse of time. There can be no real doubt that it indicates as the time when these things were carried out a period during which a family of Etruscan origin held the chief power at Rome; and there is at least much probability (though this is denied by some writers of great authority) that this rule was imposed upon Rome by the dominant power of the Etruscans.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ταρσός</foreign>). Now Terso; the chief city of Cilicia, standing near the centre of Cilicia Campestris, on the river Cydnus, about twelve miles above its mouth. All that can be determined with certainty as to its origin seems to be that it was a very ancient city of the Syrians, who were the earliest known inhabitants of this part of Asia Minor, and that it received Greek settlers at an early period. At the time of the Macedonian invasion it was held by the Persian troops, who were about to burn it, when they were prevented by Alexander's arrival. After playing an important part as a military post in the wars of the successors of Alexander, and under the Syrian kings, it became, by the peace between the Romans and Antiochus the Great, the frontier city of the Syrian kingdom on the northwest, and still flourishes, having a population estimated at 100,000. As the power of the Seleucidae declined it suffered much from the oppression of its governors, and from the wars between the members of the royal family. At the time of the Mithridatic War, it suffered, on the one hand, from Tigranes, who overran Cilicia, and, on the other, from the pirates, who had their strongholds in the mountains of Cilicia Aspera, and made frequent incursions into the level country. From both these enemies it was rescued by Pompey, who made it the capital of the new Roman province of Cilicia, B.C. 66. Under Augustus, the city obtained immunity from taxes, through the influence of the emperor's tutor, the Stoic Athenodorus, who was a native of the place. It enjoyed the favour and was called by the names of several of the later emperors. It was the scene of important events in the wars with the Persians, the Arabs, and the Turks, and also in the Crusades. Tarsus was the birthplace of many distinguished men, among them the Apostle Paul.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστός</foreign>), a loom. Although weaving was among the Greeks and Romans a distinct trade, carried on by a separate class of persons (<foreign lang="greek">ὑφάνται</foreign>, <seg lang="la">textores</seg>, and <seg lang="la">textrices, linteones</seg>), yet every considerable domestic establishment, especially in the country, contained a loom (Cato , <title>R. R.</title> 10, 14) together with the whole apparatus necessary for the working of wool (<foreign lang="greek">ταλασία, ταλασιουργία</foreign>, <seg lang="la">lanificium</seg>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscalathus">Calathus</ref>.) These occupations were all supposed to be carried on under the protection of Athené or Minerva, specially denominated Ergané (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐργάνη</foreign>). When the farm or the palace was sufficiently large to admit of it, a portion of it called the <seg lang="la">histon</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστῶν</foreign>) (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> i. 2) or <seg lang="la">textrinum</seg> was devoted to this purpose. The work was there principally carried on by female slaves (<foreign lang="greek">ἔριθοι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">quasillariae</seg>), under the superintendence of the mistress of the house (Theocr. xv. 80). Everything woven consists of two essential parts, the warp and the woof, called in Latin <seg lang="la">stamen</seg> and <seg lang="la">subtegmen, subtemen</seg>, or <seg lang="la">trama;</seg> in Greek <foreign lang="greek">στημών</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κροκή</foreign>. The warp was called <seg lang="la">stamen</seg> in Latin (from <seg lang="la">stare</seg>) on account of its erect posture in the loom. The corresponding Greek term <foreign lang="greek">στημών</foreign>, and likewise <foreign lang="greek">ἱστός</foreign>, have 
<pb n="1530" /><cb />
 evidently the same derivation. For the same reason, the very first operation in weaving was to set up the loom (<foreign lang="greek">ἱστὸν στήσασθαι</foreign>); and the web or cloth, before it was cut down or “descended” from the loom, was called <seg lang="la">pendens</seg> or <seg lang="la">pendula tela</seg>, because it hung from the transverse beam, or <seg lang="la">iugum.</seg> These particulars are all clearly exhibited in the picture of Circé's loom given in the annexed illustration. We observe there, at about the middle <figure id="fig.01530">
<head orig="Ancient Loom. (Vatican Vergil.)">Ancient Loom. (Vatican Vergil.)</head>
</figure> of the apparatus, a transverse rod passing through the warp. A straight cane was well adapted to be so used, and its application is clearly expressed by Ovid in the words <seg lang="la">stamen secernit harundo.</seg> In plain weaving it was inserted between the threads of the warp so as to divide them into two portions, the threads on one side of the rod alternating with those on the other side throughout the whole breadth of the warp. In a very ancient form of the loom there was a roller underneath the <seg lang="la">iugum</seg>, turned by a handle, and on which the web was wound as the work advanced. The threads of the warp, besides being separated by a transverse rod or plank, were divided into thirty or forty parcels, to each of which a stone was suspended for the purpose of keeping the warp in a perpendicular position, and allowing the necessary play to the strokes of the <seg lang="la">spatha.</seg> While the comparatively coarse, strong, and much-twisted thread designed for the warp was thus arranged in parallel lines, the woof remained upon the spindle (<seg lang="la">fusus</seg>), forming a spool, bobbin, or pen (<foreign lang="greek">πήνη</foreign>). This was either conveyed through the warp without any additional contrivance, or it was made to revolve in a shuttle (<seg lang="la">radius</seg>). This was made of box-wood, brought from the shores of the Euxine, and was pointed at its extremities that it might easily force its way through the warp. All that is effected by the shuttle is the conveyance of the woof across the warp. To keep every thread of the woof in its proper place it is necessary that the threads of the warp should be decussated. This was done by the leashes, called in Latin <seg lang="la">licia</seg>, in Greek <foreign lang="greek">μίτοι</foreign>. By a leash we are to understand a thread having at one end a loop, through which a thread of the warp was passed, the other end being fastened to a straight rod called <seg lang="la">liciatorium</seg>, and in Greek <foreign lang="greek">κανών</foreign>. The warp, having been divided by the <seg lang="la">harundo</seg>, as already mentioned, into two sets of threads, all those of the same set were passed through the loops of the corresponding set of leashes, and all these leashes were fastened at their other end to the same wooden rod. At least one set of leashes was necessary to decussate the warp, even in the plainest and simplest weaving. The number of sets was increased according to the complexity of the pattern, which was called <hi rend="italic">bilix</hi> or <seg lang="la">trilix</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">δίμιτος, τρίμιτος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πολύμιτος</foreign>) according as the number was two, three, or more. The process of annexing the leashes to the warp was called <seg lang="la">ordiri telam</seg>, also <seg lang="la">licia telae addere</seg>, or <seg lang="la">adnectere.</seg> It occupied two women at the same time, one of whom took in regular succession each separate thread of the warp and handed it over to the other (<foreign lang="greek">παραφέρειν, παραδίδοναι, προσφωρεῖσθαι</foreign>); the other, as she received each thread, passed it through the loop in proper order; an act which is now called “entering,” in Greek <foreign lang="greek">διάζεσθαι</foreign>. Supposing the <cb /> warp to have been thus adjusted, and the pen or the shuttle to have been carried through it, it was then decussated by drawing forwards the proper rod so as to carry one set of the threads of the warp across the rest, after which the woof was shot back again, and by the continual repetition of this process the warp and woof were interlaced. Two staves were occasionally used to fix the rods in such a position as was most convenient to assist the weaver in drawing her woof across her warp After the woof had been conveyed by the shuttle through the warp, it was driven sometimes downwards, as is represented in the woodcut, but more commonly upwards. Two different instruments were used in this part of the process. The simplest, and probably the most ancient, was in the form of a large wooden sword (<seg lang="la">spatha</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">σπάθη</foreign>). The <seg lang="la">spatha</seg> was, however, in a great degree superseded by the comb (<hi rend="italic">pecten</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">κεκρίς</foreign>), the teeth of which were inserted between the threads of the warp, and thus made by a forcible impulse to drive the threads of the woof close together.</p>
 <p>The lyre, the favorite musical instrument of the Greeks, was only known to the Romans as a foreign invention. Hence they appear to have described its parts by a comparison with the loom, with which they were familiar. The terms <seg lang="la">iugum</seg> and <seg lang="la">stamina</seg> were transferred by an obvious resemblance from the latter to the former object; and although they adopted into their own language the Greek word <seg lang="la">plectrum</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πλῆκτρον</foreign>) they used the Latin <hi rend="italic">pecten</hi> to denote the same thing, not because the instrument used in striking the lyre was at all like a comb in shape and appearance, but because it was held in the right hand and inserted between the stamina of the lyre, as the comb was between the stamina of the loom.

<pb n="1531" /><cb />
 different aspects: (1) As cultivators of the soil and ministers of the gods, in which capacity they came from Crete to Cyprus, and from thence to Rhodes, where they founded Camirus, Ialysus, and Lindus. Rhodes, which was named after them Telchinis, was abandoned by them because they foresaw that the island would be inundated. Poseidon was intrusted to them by Rhea, and they brought him up in conjunction with Caphira, a daughter of Oceanus. Rhea, Apollo, and Zeus, however, are also described as hostile to the Telchines. Apollo is said to have assumed the shape of a wolf, and to have thus destroyed the Telchines, and Zeus to have overwhelmed them by an inundation (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 7. 367" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>vii. 367</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) As sorcerers and envious daemons, their very eyes and aspect are said to have been destructive. They had it in their power to bring on hail, rain, and snow, and to assume any form they pleased; they, further, mixed Stygian water with sulphur, in order thereby to destroy animals and plants.</p>
 <p>(3) As artists they are said to have invented useful arts and institutions, and to have made images of the gods. They worked in brass and iron, and made the sickle of Cronos and the trident of Poseidon ( <bibl n="Diod.  5. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.v. 55</bibl>; Pausan. ix. 19, 1; Strabo, pp. 472, 653; Tzetz. <title>Chil.</title> vii. 124).

He was still an infant when the Trojan War began, and when his father had been absent from home nearly twenty years, Telemachus went to Pylos and Sparta to gather information concerning him. He was hospitably received by Nestor , who sent his own son to conduct Telemachus to Sparta. Menelaüs also received him kindly, and communicated to him the prophecy of Proteus concerning Odysseus. From Sparta Telemachus returned home; and on his arrival there he found his father, whom he assisted in slaying the suitors. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossodysseus">Odysseus</ref>.) According to some <cb /> accounts, Telemachus became the father of Perseptolis either by Polycasté, the daughter of Nestor , or by Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinoüs (Eustath. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Hom. p. 1796;  <bibl n="Eur.

As soon as he was born he was exposed by his grandfather, who was angry because his daughter had broken the vows of her office. In some accounts she was set adrift, like Danaë, with her child and cast on the Mysian coast. In other versions of the story Telephus was reared by a hind (<foreign lang="greek">ἔλαφος</foreign>), and educated by King Corythus in Arcadia. On reaching manhood, he consulted the Delphic Oracle to learn his parentage, and was ordered to go to King Teuthras in Mysia ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.9.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.9.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod.  4. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.iv. 33</bibl>;  <bibl n="Hyg.

He married Laodicé or Astyoché, a daughter of Priam; and he attempted to prevent the Greeks from landing on the coast of Mysia. Dionysus, however, caused him to stumble over a vine, whereupon he was wounded by Achilles ( <title>Ol.</title> ix. 112; <title>Isth.</title> v. 52; viii. 109; Pausan. x. 28; Dict. Cret. ii. 3). Being informed by an oracle that the wound could only be cured by “the wounder,” Telephus repaired to the Grecian camp; and as the Greeks had likewise learned from an oracle that without the aid of Telephus they could not reach Troy, Achilles cured Telephus by means of the rust of the spear by which he had been wounded (Dict. Cret. ii. 10;  <bibl n="Hor. Epod. 17. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Epod.</title>xvii. 8</bibl>;  <bibl n="Ov.

According to one story, Telephus, in order to induce the Greeks to help him, went to Argos, and suatching Orestes from his cradle threatened to kill him unless Agamemnon would persuade Achilles to heal the wound.

<head orig="Telōnes, Telōnae">Telones, Telonae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τελῶναι</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>, “a tax”). Among the Athenians, the name telonae was given to the farmers of the taxes and imposts, which were not collected by State officers, but were sold at certain times by auction to the highest bidder. Smaller taxes were taken up by single persons who collected the money themselves. For larger taxes demanding a large capital, companies were often formed, represented by one person called the <foreign lang="greek">τελωνάρχης</foreign>, who concluded the contract with the State. Sureties had also to be produced on this occasion. Such companies employed subordinate officers to collect the taxes. The payments were made by the farmers at certain periods at the senate-house, or <foreign lang="greek">βουλευτήριον</foreign>, and one payment was usually made in advance when the contract was made. In default of payment, the farmer became <foreign lang="greek">ἄτιμος</foreign>, and in certain circumstances might be imprisoned. If the debt was not paid by the expiration of the ninth <hi rend="italic">prytaneia</hi>, it was doubled, and the property of the debtor and his sureties confiscated. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign> descended to the children until the debt was paid. On the other hand, the farmer was protected by the State against fraud by severe laws. He was also exempt from military service, so that he might not be hindered in performing his duties.

<head orig="Telos">Telos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign>). A tax. The taxes imposed by the Athenians and collected at home were either ordinary or extraordinary. The former constituted a regular or permanent source of income; the latter were only raised in time of war or other emergency. The ordinary taxes were held mostly upon property, and upon citizens indirectly, in the shape of toll or customs; though the resident aliens paid a poll-tax (called <foreign lang="greek">μετοίκιον</foreign>) for the liberty of residing at Athens under the protection of the State. There was a duty of two per cent. (<foreign lang="greek">πεντηκοστή</foreign>) levied upon all exports and imports. An excise was paid on all sales in the market (called <foreign lang="greek">ἐπωνία</foreign>), though it is not known what the amount was. Slave-owners paid a duty of three oboli for every slave they kept; and slaves who had been emancipated paid the same. This was for a long time a very productive tax before the fortification of Decelea by the Lacedaemonians. The justice fees (<foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖα, παράστασις</foreign>) were a lucrative tax in time of peace. The extraordinary taxes were the property-tax, and the compulsory services called “liturgies” (<foreign lang="greek">λειτουργίαι</foreign>). Some of these last were regular, and recurred annually; the most important, the <hi rend="italic">trierarchia</hi>, was a war-service, and performed as occasion required. As these services were all performed, wholly or partly, at the expense of the individual, they may be regarded as a species of tax. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosseisphora">Eisphora</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstrierarchia">Trierarchia</ref>.) The tribute (<foreign lang="greek">φόρος</foreign>) paid by the allied States to the Athenians formed, in the flourishing period of the Republic, a regular and most important source of revenue. In Olymp. 91-2, the Athenians substituted for the tribute a duty of five per cent. (<foreign lang="greek">εἰκοστή</foreign>) on all commodities exported or imported by the subject States, thinking to raise by this means a larger income than by direct taxation. <cb /> This was terminated by the issue of the Peloponnesian War, though the tribute was afterwards revived, on more equitable principles, under the name of <foreign lang="greek">σύνταξις</foreign>. Other sources of revenue were derived by the Athenians from their mines (<foreign lang="greek">μέταλλα</foreign>), and public lands, fines, and confiscations. The public demesne lands, whether pasture or arable, houses or other buildings, were usually let by auction to private persons. The conditions of the lease were engraved on stone. The rent was payable by prytaneias. These various sources of revenue produced, according to Aristophanes, an annual income of two thousand talents in the most flourishing period of Athenian hegemony. Though <foreign lang="greek">τέλος</foreign> may signify any payment in the nature of a tax or duty, it is more commonly used of the ordinary taxes, as customs, etc. <foreign lang="greek">Ἰσοτέλεια</foreign> signifies the right of being taxed on the same footing and having other privileges the same as citizens—a right sometimes granted to resident aliens; <foreign lang="greek">ἀτέλεια</foreign> signifies an exemption from taxes, or other duties and services—an honour very rarely granted by the Athenians.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τέμπη</foreign>, contr. of <foreign lang="greek">Τέμπεα</foreign>). A beautiful and romantic valley in the north of Thessaly, between Mounts Olympus and Ossa, through which the Peneus escapes into the sea. The scenery of this glen is frequently praised by poets; and it was also celebrated as one of the favourite haunts of Apollo, who had transplanted his laurel from this spot to Delphi. The whole valley is rather less than five miles in length, and opens gradually to the east into a wide plain. Tempé is also of great importance in history, as it is the only pass through which an army can invade Thessaly from the north. In some parts the rocks on each side of the Peneus approach so close to each other as only to leave room between them for the stream, 
<pb n="1533" /><cb />
 and the road is cut out of the rock in the narrowest point. Tempé is the only channel through which the waters of the Thessalian plain descend into the sea; and it was the common opinion in antiquity that these waters had once covered the country with a vast lake, till an outlet was formed for them by some great convulsion in nature which rent the rocks of Tempé asunder ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 129" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 129</bibl>; Strabo, p. 430; Caesar, <title>B.

<head orig="Templum">Templum</head>

 <p> (the Greek <foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign>). Originally a space marked out with the <seg lang="la">lituus</seg> (q. v.) by the augur (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaugur">Augur</ref>) according to a certain fixed procedure when he pitched his tent (<seg lang="la">tabernaculum capere</seg>). It was then regarded as separate from any other land (<seg lang="la">locus liberatus et effatus</seg>). Its ground-plan was a square or rectangle, having its four sides turned to the different points of the compass; its front, however, according to strict Roman custom, faced towards the west, so that any one entering the temple had his face turned towards the east. It was not until later that the front was frequently made to face the east. The building erected on this space, and corresponding to it in plan, did not become a <seg lang="la">fanum</seg>, or sanctuary of the gods, until it had been consecrated by the <hi rend="italic">pontifices.</hi> See <ref type="cross" target="crossdedicatio">Dedicatio</ref>.</p>
 <p>As, however, there were <seg lang="la">fana</seg> which were not templa—e. g., all circular buildings—so there were templa which were not <seg lang="la">fana.</seg> Of this sort were the places where public affairs were transacted, such as the Rostra in the Forum, the places where the Comitia met or the Senate assembled, and even the city of Rome itself. The sanctuaries of the gods were designed as templa if they were intended to serve for meetings of the Senate, and if the form of worship prescribed for such sanctuaries were appropriate to the definition of a templum. For the word as used to designate a building, see the next article.

<head orig="Templum">Templum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ναός</foreign>, Att. <foreign lang="greek">νεώς· ἱερόν</foreign>). A temple, the word containing the root of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign>. (See the preceding article.) In ancient times temples were regarded as the dwelling-places and treasuries of the gods to whom they were dedicated. They might contain an image or not, but the latter case was exceptional. As they were not houses of worship intended for the devotion of a great multitude, they were usually of very limited extent. There were, however, temples of considerable size, among which was that of Artemis in Ephesus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossephesus">Ephesus</ref>), 438 feet long by 226 broad; that of Heré in Samos; that begun by Pisistratus and finished by Hadrian, and dedicated to Zeus Olympius in Athens (see <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossolympieum">Olympieum</ref>); and the temple of Zeus at Agrigentum, which was never wholly completed. All of these were nearly as large as the first mentioned. Only temples like that at Eleusis, in which the celebration of the Mysteries took place, were intended to accommodate a larger number of people. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmysteria">Mysteria</ref>.) The great sacrifices and banquets shared by all the people were celebrated in the <cb /> court of the temple (<foreign lang="greek">περίβολος</foreign>), which included the altars for sacrifice, and was itself surrounded by a wall with only one place of entrance. It was a feature common to all temples that they were not built directly on the surface of the ground, but were raised on a substructure which was mounted by means of an uneven number of steps, so that people were able as a good omen to put their right foot on the first and last step (Vitruv. iii. 4, 8; cf. <bibl n="Petron.  30" default="NO">Petron.30</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The usual shape of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi> temples was an oblong about twice as long as wide, at the front and back of which was a pediment or gable-roof (<foreign lang="greek">ἀετός, ἀέτωμα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">fastigium</seg>). Round temples with dome-shaped roofs were the exception. The principal part of the temple was the chamber containing the image of the god. This stood upon a pedestal which was often placed in a small niche (<seg lang="la">aedicula</seg>) and usually stood facing the east, opposite foldingdoors which always opened outwards. Before the image stood an altar used for bloodless sacrifices. This chamber, called in Greek <foreign lang="greek">ναός</foreign>, and in Latin <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, generally received its light through the open door alone, but sometimes there was also an opening in the roof. There were also temples designated <hi rend="italic">hypaethral</hi> (from <foreign lang="greek">ὕπαιθρος</foreign>, “in the open air”); in these there was no roof to the middle chamber of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, which was separated from the lateral portions by one or more rows of pillars on each side.</p>
 <p>Generally each temple belonged to only one god; but sometimes a temple was regarded as the dwelling-place of several deities, either those who were worshipped in groups, as the Muses, or those who were supposed to stand in close alliance or other relationship to each other, such as the twins Apollo and Artemis, and Apollo, as leader of the Muses, together with the Muses themselves. Frequently only one god had an image and altar in the chief <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, while others were worshipped in adjoining chapels. Lastly, there were double temples, with two <seg lang="la">cellae</seg> built in opposite directions. Many temples had, besides the <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, a kind of Holy of Holies (<foreign lang="greek">ἄδυτον, μέγαρον</foreign>) which was entered only by the priests, and by them only at certain times, and which was sometimes under the ground. Usually an open porch or vestibule (<foreign lang="greek">πρόναος</foreign>), with pillars in front, stood before the <seg lang="la">cella</seg>, and in it were exposed the dedicatory offerings. There was often also an inner chamber behind the image (<foreign lang="greek">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign>) which served for various purposes, the valuables and money belonging to the temple being often kept there. It was surrounded by a wall, and the door was well secured by locks.</p>
 <p>The various kinds of temples are usually distinguished according to the number and arrangement of the pillars. Thus:</p>
 <p>(1) A temple <seg lang="la">in antis</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν παράστασι</foreign>) is one in which the <seg lang="la">pronaos</seg> (sometimes also the <seg lang="la">opisthodomos</seg>) was formed by the prolongation of the side walls of the temple (<foreign lang="greek">παράσταδες</foreign>, <seg lang="la">antae</seg>) and by two <figure id="fig.01533">
<head orig="Fig. 1.">Fig. 1.</head>
</figure> columns placed between the terminal pilasters of the <seg lang="la">antae</seg> (q.v.).
 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>Prostylos</title> (<foreign lang="greek">πρόστυλος</foreign>), with the columns in front (fig. 1), is an epithet descriptive of a temple, the front of whose <seg lang="la">pronaos</seg> was formed in all its breadth by a row of columns quite separate from the walls, and with the columns at the extremities standing in front of the <seg lang="la">antae.</seg>
 </p>
 <p>(3) <title>Amphiprostylos</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφιπρόστυ-</foreign> 
<pb n="1534" /><cb /></p>
 <p><foreign lang="greek">λος</foreign>) describes a temple (fig. 2) with the columns arranged at the back as well as in the front.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <title>Peripteros</title> (<foreign lang="greek">περίπτερος</foreign>) describes a temple (fig. 3) surrounded on all sides by a colonnade sup<figure id="fig.01534">
<head orig="Fig. 2.">Fig. 2.</head>
</figure> <figure id="fig.01534.2">
<head orig="Fig. 3.">Fig. 2.</head>
</figure> porting the architrave. This is the type most frequently employed by the Greeks.
 </p>
 <p>(5) <title>Pseudoperipteros</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ψευδοπερίπτερος</foreign>, “falsely <figure id="fig.01534.3">
<head orig="Fig. 4.">Fig. 4.</head>
</figure> <hi rend="italic">peripteros</hi>”) is an epithet of a temple in which the architrave appears to be carried by pilasters or by “engaged” columns in the walls of the <seg lang="la">cella.</seg> This form is seldom used by the Greeks, but often by the Romans.
 </p>
 <p>(6) <title>Dipteros</title> (<foreign lang="greek">δίπτερος</foreign>) describes a temple (fig. 5) surrounded by two ranges of columns.
 </p>
 <p>(7) <title>Pseudodipteros</title> (<foreign lang="greek">ψευδοδίπτερος</foreign>, “falsely <hi rend="italic">dipteros</hi>,” fig. 6). A temple surrounded with only a sin<figure id="fig.01534.4">
<head orig="Fig. 5.">Fig. 5.</head>
</figure> <figure id="fig.01534.5">
<head orig="Fig. 6.">Fig. 5.</head>
</figure> gle range of columns, but at such a distance that they correspond in position to the exterior range of the dipteral temple.</p>
 <p>According to the number of columns in front, which must always be an even number, since the entrance was in the middle, it is usual to distinguish temples as <seg lang="la">tetra-, hexa-, octa-, deca-</seg>, or <hi rend="italic">dodecastylos</hi> (with four, six, eight, ten, or twelve columns). The number of columns along each side was usually one more than twice the number along the front, but this was not the invariable rule. (For the architrave and for the columns of the different orders, see <ref type="cross" target="crossarchitectura">Architectura</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna">Columna</ref>.) The frieze resting on the architrave, and (in the Doric order) the metopes (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοπαι</foreign>) in particular (q. v.), as well as the two pediments (<foreign lang="greek">τύμπανα</foreign>), were decorated with sculptures, and these sculptures, as well as the walls of the temple, often had more life-like and more varied appearance given to them by appropriate colouring. The coping of the roof, as well as the angles of the pediment, was ornamented by <foreign lang="greek">ἀκροτήρια</foreign>, which consisted of statues, vases, or <foreign lang="greek">ἀνθέμια</foreign>, groups of flowers and leaves.</p>
 <p>In the plan of their temples the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Romans</hi> originally followed the Etruscans. The ground-plan of the Etruscan temple was nearly a square, the ratio of the depth to frontage being as six to five. Half of the space was taken up by the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> and the rest by the columns. The architrave was of wood, and without any special frieze. The great temple with three <seg lang="la">cellae</seg> on the Roman Capitol was built in the Etruscan style, the middle and largest <seg lang="la">cella</seg> being sacred to Iupiter, and the smaller ones on either side to Minerva and Iuno. Under <cb /> Greek influence the different forms of the Greek temple began to be imitated at Rome, the most prevalent type being that described as <hi rend="italic">prostylos</hi>, which lent itself most easily to the requirements of a templum in the strict sense of the term. An important alteration in the Greek form of temple was brought about by the introduction of vaulted arches or groined ceilings, which were seldom used by the Greeks, and never on a large scale, but were brought to great perfection by the Romans. They took the form of a cylindrical vaulting in the case of a quadrangular <seg lang="la">cella</seg> and a dome in the case of the round temples, which were frequent with the Romans. The two principal forms of the latter are (1) the <hi rend="italic">monopteros</hi>, which consisted of a single circle of columns standing on a platform mounted by steps and supporting the columns which bore a dome on a circular architrave.</p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">peripteros</hi>, with the same arrangement of columns, but with a circular <seg lang="la">cella</seg> in the middle which was covered by a dome rising from the surrounding colonnade. In a third variety, of which we have an example in the <ref type="cross" target="crosspantheon">Pantheon</ref> (q.v.), the circular body of the building is not surrounded by columns externally, but only provided on one side with an advanced portico.</p>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Tenĕdus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Τένεδος</foreign>). A small island of the Aegaean Sea, off the coast of Troas, of an importance very disproportionate to its size, on account of its position near the mouth of the Hellespont, from which it is about twelve miles distant. It appears in the legend of the Trojan War as the station to which the Greeks withdrew their fleet, in order to induce the Trojans to think that they had departed, and to receive the wooden horse ( <bibl n="Verg.

In the Persian War it <cb /> was used by Xerxes as a naval station ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 31</bibl>). It afterwards became a tributary ally of Athens, and adhered to her during the whole of the Peloponnesian War, and down to the peace of Antalcidas, by which it was surrendered to the Persians. At the Macedonian conquest the Tenedians regained their liberty. The women of the island were noted for their beauty (Athen. p. 609).

 <head><surname full="yes">Terentius Afer</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Publius</foreName>
 <p>, usually called in English <hi rend="SmallCaps">Terence</hi>. Our principal source of information regarding the life of P. Terentius Afer is an extract from Suetonius's work <title>De Viris Illustribus</title>, preserved by Donatus in the introduction to his commentary on Terence (see Suet. p. 291, Roth). Some of the statements contained in this life are confirmed by later writers, and light is thrown on the literary and personal relations of the poet by the prologues to the different plays. From these sources, chiefly, the facts of his life, so far as they are known, have been gleaned, and are in brief as follows: Terence was a native of Carthage (though his cognomen, Afer, suggests that he was of African [Libyan], not Phoenician, parentage). He came to Rome as a slave, where he became the property of the senator Terentius Lucanus, who, impressed by the natural gifts of the young African, had him educated, and afterwards gave him his freedom. How he came to Rome is uncertain. The suggestion that he was a captive taken in war is discredited by the fact that he lived within the period beginning with the close of the Second Punic War (B.C. 201), and ending with the commencement of the Third (B.C. 149)—a fact noted by Fenestella ( Suet. p. 292, Roth). It is possible, however, that he was purchased by Lucanus from a slave-dealer who either caught him or bought him in Africa (see Teuffel-Schwabe, <title>Rom. Lit.</title> 102, 3). According to the custom of the day he took the <seg lang="la">nomen</seg> of his former master; but his <seg lang="la">praenomen</seg> may have been received from another patron, who, it has been thought, was Scipio Africanus the Younger. He is described as of medium stature, graceful in person, and of dark complexion ( Suet. p. 294, Roth). His personal attractions and the fact of his African birth won for him the esteem and confidence of Scipio Aemilianus, through whom and the comic poet Caecilius he became intimate with Gaius Laelius, Furius Philus, and other members of the younger circle of literary men at Rome—men who <cb /> loved Greek literature for its own sake and lent the weight of their influence against the sentiment, prevalent at Rome since the days of Cato , that the pursuit of Greek culture and learning tended to luxury and the corruption of morals. Sulpicius Gallus, Quintus Fabius Labeo , and Marcus Popilius, men of consular rank, and distinguished for their literary attainments, were also among his friends and admirers. <figure id="fig.01538">

 <p>A pretty but apocryphal story is told by Suetonius (p. 292, Roth) in reference to his first play, the <title>Andria</title>, or “Maid of Andros.” On presenting it to the aediles for acceptance he was bidden by them to take it for judgment to Caecilius, then an old man. Terence entered the presence of Caecilius when the latter was at dinner, and being in mean attire was not received with very marked demonstrations of respect. Accordingly he proceeded to read his play, seated on a <seg lang="la">subsellium</seg> or stool placed at the foot of the festal couch, but had not gone far with his recitation when he was invited by the literary veteran to “recline” with him at table. The reading continued until the play was finished, when Caecilius again expressed his approval and delight. As Caecilius died in 168, and the <title>Andria</title> was first exhibited in 166, this story is regarded by some critics as doubtful; but the substance of it is given in the Eusebian Chronicle, and it may easily have happened that the <title>Andria</title> was ready for representation two years before its actual appearance on the stage. Now it was more particularly to please such men as Caecilius and Scipio, and others already named, who favoured a strict adherence to Greek models, that Terence wrote his comedies, and it would have been natural that before publishing his compositions he should read them in the presence of his noble friends and avail himself of their observations and suggestions. Such a practice would account in part for the genuine Roman character of Terence's style and language. But that his plays were actually written for him by Scipio and Laelius—a charge brought against him by his rivals— is not fully sustained by anything that we know. The charge was asserted by one Luscius Lanuvinus, who is referred to in Terence's prologues as <seg lang="la">malivolus vetus poeta.</seg> This “malignant old poet” was at the head of the opposite party, which contended vigorously for a close imitation of the earlier Latin comedians, and resented the innovations of what may be called the Greek school. His enmity, however, was largely ignored by Terence, who refused either to confirm or deny the charge of plagiarism (see Prol. to <title>Adel.</title> 15 foll.). This ret 
<pb n="1539" /><cb />
 icence has had the effect of lending an air of probability to the charge. It was no doubt owing, however, to a disinclination openly to avow that which might give offence to men whose good will he could not afford to lose; or else to an unwillingness to make public denial of what he considered to be unworthy of serious notice. Another sin laid at the door of our poet by his enemies was the practice of <seg lang="la">contaminatio.</seg> “Contamination” was the process of combining parts of two or more plays in one. It afforded opportunity to work up a more elaborate plot, and to introduce greater variety of incident and character, than a strict adherence to a single original would have done; but the practice was a dangerous one, as it often led to accidental contradictions and inconsistencies in the plot. Terence readily admits the charge, and defends it in his prologues.</p>
 <p>After producing six comedies, between B.C. 166 and 160, Terence went to Greece, in order, we are told, to escape suspicion of plagiarism, or, as is more credible, to study Greek life and institutions, with the object of representing them more accurately on the Roman stage (see Suet. pp. 293-294, Roth). The best manuscripts state that he set out in his twenty-fifth year; inferior manuscripts say in his thirty-fifth. If the former are to be relied on, Terence must have been born in B.C. 185, which was also the year of Scipio's birth. This would make Terence only nineteen years old in B.C. 166, the year in which his first play was brought out. Now it is highly improbable that a composition so finished in style, and so true in its delineation of human character, as the <title>Andria</title> should have been the work of so youthful a writer. It is extremely natural, on the other hand, that his well-known intimacy with Scipio should have led to the supposition that the two men were contemporaries, and Suetonius quotes Cornelius Nepos as affirming that Terence, Scipio, and Laelius were of the same age ( Suet. p. 292, Roth). On the contrary, Fenestella (an antiquarian of the Augustan period) is also cited by Suetonius as contending that the poet was older than his two friends. Everything considered, we are inclined to place the year of Terence's birth considerably earlier than B.C. 185, and it is not unlikely that the number XXXV, already alluded to as possibly representing his age at the time of the journey to Greece, gives the real clue to the situation, in spite of the fact that it occurs only in interpolated manuscripts. Terence never returned to Italy, but died abroad in B.C. 159. Accounts vary as to the place and manner of his death. Quintus Cosconius is authority for the statement that he perished at sea on his way back from Greece, and that his translations of one hundred and eight of Menander's comedies perished with him. This is in part confirmed by Vulcatius, whose lines on the death of Terence are given by Suetonius. Another account relates that he died at Stymphalus in Arcadia (or at Leucadia) from an illness induced by grief at the loss of his baggage and MSS., which he had sent on before him to the ship in which he was to sail for Italy. He died possessed, says Suetonius, of twenty <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> of cultivated land on the Appian Way, and his daughter subsequently was married to a Roman knight; but according to Porcius, whom also our biographer cites, he had not even a hired house whither a slave might report the news of his master's death; of so little profit to <cb /> him had been his intimacy with Furius, Laelius, and Scipio.</p>
 <p>The six comedies written and exhibited at Rome by Terence have been transmitted to us. The following enumeration gives them in the supposed order of their composition according to the Codex Bembinus:</p>
 <p>I. The <title>Andria</title>, or Maid of Andros, based on the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀνδρία</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Περινθία</foreign> of Menander; first exhibited at the Ludi Megalenses, in B.C. 166.</p>
 <p>II. The <title>Eunuchus</title>, based on the <foreign lang="greek">Εὐνοῦχος</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Κόλαξ</foreign> of Menander; first performed at the Ludi Megalenses, in B.C. 161.</p>
 <p>III. The <title>Heauton Timorumenos</title>, or Self-tormentor, based on the <foreign lang="greek">Ἑαυτὸν Τιμορούμενος</foreign> of Menander; first performed at the Ludi Megalenses, in B.C. 163.</p>
 <p>IV. The <title>Phormio</title> (name of the parasite in the play), based on the <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπιδικαζόμενος</foreign> of Apollodorus; first performed at the Ludi Romani, in B.C. 161.</p>
 <p>V. The <title>Hecyra</title>, or Mother-in-law, based on the <foreign lang="greek">Ἑκυρά</foreign> of Apollodorus, and (possibly) the <foreign lang="greek">Ἐπιτρέποντες</foreign> of Menander; first brought out at the Ludi Megalenses, in B.C. 165.</p>
 <p>VI. The <title>Adelphoe</title>, or Brothers, taken from the <foreign lang="greek">Ἀδελφοί</foreign> of Menander, with one scene added from the <foreign lang="greek">Συναποθνῄσκοντες</foreign> of Diphilus; first performed at the funeral games of Aemilius Paulus, in B.C. 160.</p>
 <p>The first performance of the <title>Hecyra</title> was interrupted by the greater attractions of a rope-dancer, as we learn from the prologues to the play (1. 4 and 2. 26). A second attempt at exhibition was made, but without success, at the funeral games of Lucius Aemilius Paulus—the occasion on which the <title>Adelphoe</title> was presented; but it was not until it had been brought before the public for the third time—at the Ludi Romani of the same year—that the <title>Hecyra</title> met with the desired recognition. (See Dziatzko, <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> 20, 576; 21, 72; Ritschl, <bibl n="Cic. Op. 2. 237" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Op.</title>ii. 237</bibl>; Teuffel, 110, 5, 3.)</p>
 <p>The external history, so to speak, of the several plays was given in the <hi rend="italic">didascaliae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">διδασκαλίαι</foreign>). These were prefatory notices inserted in the MSS., probably by Roman grammarians of the Augustan age, and when complete were indicative of the following particulars: (1) The name of the play and of the Latin poet;</p>
 <p>(2) the name of the public games or festival at which the play was first brought out;</p>
 <p>(3) the names of the managers or directors of the games;</p>
 <p>(4) the name of the chief actor and director of the troop or <seg lang="la">grex;</seg></p>
 <p>(5) the name of the musical composer;</p>
 <p>(6) the species of flute employed;</p>
 <p>(7) the title of the Greek original, and the name of its author;</p>
 <p>(8) the number indicating the place of the play in the order of composition of the works of the poet;</p>
 <p>(9) the names of the consuls for the year in which the play was first exhibited. In examining the <hi rend="italic">didascaliae</hi> of Terence we notice particularly that the principal actor and director of the troop for all the plays is Lucius Ambivius Turpio; that the composer of the flute-music is in every instance Flaccus, the slave of Claudius, and that two Greek poets only, Menander and Apollodorus, have been selected by Terence for imitation—if we except the small part played by Diphilus in contributing to the <title>Adelphoe.</title></p>
 <p>It is evident that Terence selected as his models the most refined of the writers of the New Comedy of Athens. A comparison of the plays with the fragments of the Greek comic poets (ed. Meineke) sustains this view; and his efforts at refinement 
<pb n="1540" /><cb />
 of speech and manners, together with his fondness in general for things Greek, are especially noticeable in reference to certain peculiarities of treatment. Of all the titles of his plays not one is a purely Latin name; and the same may be said of his <seg lang="la">dramatis personae</seg>—of those at least who speak on the stage. His allusions to Roman customs and institutions are rare as compared with those in Plautus; and his personages, whether rich or poor, slaves or free, speak much alike, their style being that in vogue in the cultivated circles at Athens. Where Plautus uses the language of the street Terence continues to employ that of the <hi rend="italic">salon</hi> and the drawing-room. Exaggerated puns and plays on words, newly made forms and forced expressions, coarse humour and obscene talk— which abounded in the plays of Plautus and rendered them highly acceptable to the Roman populace, whom Plautus wrote to please—these found slight favour with Terence, whose most appreciative audience, as has been already remarked, was of a different stamp. All six comedies are remarkable for their smoothness and moderate tone, as well as for the art with which the plot is unfolded, through the natural sequence of incidents and play of motives. Striking effects, sharp contrasts and incongruities, extravagance of speech and even creative fancy, which characterize the writings of the elder poet, are almost wholly absent. Terence did not aim at originality. His purpose was to present a true picture of Greek life and manners in the purest Latin at his command; and although the attempt was made with a loss to himself of the popularity enjoyed by Plautus, yet if the judgment of succeeding generations is a fair criterion he must be credited with having fully attained his object. The language which he received from Plautus he improved and rendered more artistic by shaping it carefully to the graceful rhythm and diction of the Greek dramatists, notably Menander. This is his great gift to Roman literature—a gift not wholly appreciated until the cultivation of letters, and in particular the study of Terence, had become fashionable in the time of Cicero.</p>
 <p>Yet Terence had the faults of his qualities, and his defects are noticed by the literary critics of the century succeeding his own. He is called by Caesar a Menander cut-in-two (<title>O dimidiate Menander</title>, Suet. p. 294, Roth), since he reflects the refinement and finish of the Greek poet, but lacks his force and comic vigour; and Cicero in similar fashion credits him with having given Menander to the Romans, but in subdued tones (<seg lang="la">sedatis vocibus</seg>, Suet. p. 294, Roth). And in accordance with these criticisms we find the manners, habits, and customs of men correctly portrayed in his comedies, but their passions and desires suppressed and moderated. There is much <foreign lang="greek">ἦθος</foreign>, but little <foreign lang="greek">πάθος</foreign>. The lyrical element is much thrust into the background, and the whole metrical structure of the drama is less complex than in the comedies of Plautus. In short, while Plautus wrote always for the people, Terence never failed to keep in view the circle of noblemen and <seg lang="la">literati</seg>, whose encouragement and patronage were his mainstay, and whose culture and learning and breadth of view afforded him a standard and a guide.</p>
 <p>While the comedies of Terence were occasionally exhibited after his death (see Dziatzko, <title>Ueber die Terenz. Didaskalien</title> in the <title>Rh. Mus.</title> xx. 570; xxi. 64), they became also a special subject for <cb /> study with the learned. Suetonius's Life has transmitted to us the names of not a few historians, biographers, and antiquarians, who busied themselves with his writings. Such were Fenestella, Cornelius Nepos, Porcius Licinus, Volcacius Sedigitus, Varro, Santra, Q. Cosconius, Cicero, and Caesar. In the so-called <title>Auctorium Aeli Donati</title> also are the names of the critic Maecius (Tarpa) and the poet Vallegius or Vagellius. The first is reported as saying that there were two poets bearing the name of Terence, the other being a native of Fregellae and distinguished as Terentius Libo. The second is of interest to us as repeating the charge that Terence merely “brought out the plays of Scipio.” Cicero quotes Terence in his letters and orations (cf. <title>Ad Fam.</title> i. 9, 19; <bibl n="Phil.  2. 6" default="NO">Phil.ii. 6</bibl><bibl n="Phil.  15" default="NO">Phil., 15</bibl>), and Horace in his Satires and Epistles exhibits decided traces of the comic poet's influence and happy expression. This influence was not confined, however, to literature, but extended to the thought and speech of everyday life. Many of Terence's sayings became proverbs, and the oft-quoted verse <seg lang="la">homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto </seg> (<title>Heaut.</title> i. 1, 77) voices a spirit of tolerance and sympathy with human nature which was foreign to the old Roman austerity of character, and may be set down as the lesson taught the Romans by the comedy of Menander.</p>
 <p>In later times also the writings of Terence have been pointed to as models of good style and poetic finish. Petrarch speaks of both him and Plautus in terms of unlimited eulogy. The great Latin writers of the Renaissance, such as Erasmus and Melanchthon, made a careful study of his works; and in modern literature the French especially have been his ardent admirers and most frequent imitators. He is described by Montaigne (in the words of Horace) as <seg lang="la">liquidus puroque simillimus amni</seg>, and the same writer adds, “he does so possess the soul with his graces that we forget those of his fable” (<title>Essays of Montaigne</title>, trans. by Cotton, chap. lxvii.). He is praised by Fénelon above Molière, while Sainte-Beuve accords him unstinted eulogy in his <title>Nouveaux Lundis;</title> and M. Joubert says of Terence: <quote lang="fr">“Le miel attique est sur ses lèvres; on croirait aisément qu'il naquit sur le mont Hymette.”</quote> (See <title>Histoire de la Littérature Latine</title>, by E. Neqrette; and Sellar, <title>Roman Poets of the Republic</title>, p. 220.) Michael Baron's <title>L'Andrienne</title> is a reflection of the <title>Andria;</title> Bruey's <title>Le Muet</title> and La Fontaine's <title>L'Eunuque</title> are based on the <title>Eunuchus</title>, and Molière's <title>Le Mariage Forcé</title> and <title>Les Fourberies de Scapin</title> remind us of the <title>Phormio.</title> Baron's <title>L'École des Pères</title>, and Fagan's <title>La Pupille</title> are more than suggested by the <title>Adelphoe</title>, which has also contributed largely to the <title>École des Maris</title> of Molière. In England the <title>Andria</title> has been imitated in Steele's <title>Conscious Lovers</title>, the <title>Adelphoe</title> in Garrick's <title>Guardian</title>, and the <title>Eunuchus</title> in Sir Charles Sedley's <title>Bellamira;</title> and the <title>Adelphoe</title> has furnished the leading characters in Cumberland's <title>Choleric Man</title>, and Shadwell's <title>Squire of Alsatia.</title> Indeed, dramatic literature in general owes much to Terence, and his influence upon the literary style of later ages has been both marked and extensive.</p>
 <p>The farther the language of Terence became removed through time from the speech of everyday life the greater became the demand for exegetical commentaries on the text. Among the names of early commentators is that of M. Valerius Probus of Berytus, who is known to have revised and an 
<pb n="1541" /><cb />
 notated editions of Lucretius, Vergil, Horace, Persius, and Terence in the first century of the Christian era. The commentary of Aelius Donatus, who taught at Rome about the middle of the fourth century A.D., relates to all the plays except the <title>Heauton Timorumenos</title>, and consists in reality of his own work united with that of an elder contemporary named Euanthius. That part which related to the <title>Heauton Timorumenos</title> has been lost, but its place is indifferently supplied by J. Calphurnius, who wrote in the fifteenth century. The commentary of Eugraphius, who is believed to have lived in the sixth century A.D., is of less value to us than that of Donatus. Its main purpose was to lay down for school children the laws of rhetoric as they applied to the study of Terence. The grammarians Servius (who wrote at Rome in the fourth century A.D.) and Priscianus (who wrote in Latin at Constantinople in the latter part of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century) furnish important information. Other commentators were Aemilius Asper, Helenius Acro, and perhaps Arruntius Celsus the grammarian. Under the head of commentary should fall also the <hi rend="italic">periochae</hi> of Sulpicius Apollinaris of the second century A.D., one of which is prefixed to each play and consists of twelve verses—each verse being an iambic senarius. The <hi rend="italic">periochae</hi> contain brief summaries of the plots, and, like the <hi rend="italic">didascaliae</hi> and the <seg lang="la">praefationes</seg> of Donatus (or Euanthius) connected with them, are of value in determining the meaning of the text.</p>
 <p>To our list of early commentaries should be added the scholia of the Codex Bembinus. These are accessible in the special articles of Umpfenbach in <title>Hermes</title>, ii., and Studemund in <title>Neue Jahrb.</title> 97. The scholia of the other manuscripts were thought by Umpfenbach to be unworthy of particular study, but their importance has been demonstrated by Frid. Schlee, whose edition of the “<title>Scholia Terentiana</title> existing in MSS. other than the Bembine” was published at Leipzig in 1893. See an analysis of the same by S. G. Ashmore in the <title>Class. Rev.</title> vol. viii. No. 8.</p>
 <p>The manuscripts of Terence have been separated into three classes. The Codex Bembinus (A) constitutes in itself Class I. The remaining codices have been divided by Umpfenbach into two groups, according to their supposed merit. To the first group, or Class II., belong the Victorianus (D), the Decurtatus (G), and Fragmentum Vindobonense (V). This is the D family. The second group, or Class III., contains the Parisinus (P), Vaticanus (C), Basilicanus (B), Ambrosianus (F), and Riccardianus (E). These are known as the P family. These nine codices are all that were considered by Umpfenbach to be worthy of collation. The most ancient of them is the Bembinus, so called from its owner, Cardinal Pietro Bembo, who lived from A.D. 1470 to 1547. It is also the most trustworthy, because it is the only MS. certainly free from the arbitrary alterations of the unknown grammarian Calliopius, who made an effort to settle the text of Terence in the fourth or fifth century A.D. The MSS. of Class III. contain marginal paintings or miniatures illustrating the scenes in the different plays. Those of the Codex Vaticanus are especially notable (see Frid. Leo, <title>Rh. Mus.</title> xxviii. 335). Twenty-six of them, comprising the complete set for the <title>Phormio</title>, have been reproduced in this country from photographs taken in the Vatican <cb /> library expressly for the Classical Department of Harvard University, and with the permission of the Cardinal Librarian and the Pope. They are said never before <bibl default="NO">(1893)</bibl> to have been accurately reproduced. The illustrations in the Codex Parisinus are also very fine, and for this reason the MS. is kept on exhibition in the <title>Salle d'Exposition des Imprimés et des Manuscrits</title> in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. A description of it is given by Umpfenbach in his preface. As to which of the two groups, Class II. or Class III., is the more authoritative, there is much dispute. For a discussion of the question see Ashmore's review of Schlee's work on the scholia, cited above, and an article by Professor E. M. Pease in the <title>Transactions of the American Philological Association</title> for 1887, vol. xviii. (See also Ashmore's edition of the <title>Adelphoe</title>, pp. li. and lii., Macmillan &amp; Co.) On the whole, it is most probable that the Parisinus (P) and Vaticanus (C) have suffered less from errors creeping into the individual MSS. than the Victorianus (D) and the Decurtatus (G), and that more changes have been made in the archetype of the D family than in the archetype of the P family.</p>

 <p>Among modern editors of Terence, Gabriel Faernus <bibl default="NO">(Florence, 1565)</bibl> is well known for his careful examination of the Bembine Codex, and Guyet <bibl default="NO">(Strassburg, 1657)</bibl> for his scholarship and readiness to condemn as spurious difficult passages in the text. Richard Bentley is famous for the excellence of his critical commentary, and for the attention he gave to the metres. His editions <bibl default="NO">(London, 1726; Amsterdam, 1727)</bibl> mark an era in Terentian criticism. Bentley's English manuscripts of Terence are discussed by Umpfenbach ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 32. 442" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phil.</title>xxxii. 442</bibl>), and by Minton Warren (<title>Amer. Jour. of Philol.</title> iii. 59). For more than a century after Bentley no edition of Terence appeared which could be mentioned as presenting a decided improvement of the text. That by E. St. John Parry <bibl default="NO">(London, 1857)</bibl> is lacking in critical discernment. That of Fleckeisen <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1857)</bibl> presents a text which is in advance of that of Parry, for Fleckeisen made good use of a collation of the Bembine Codex by Petrus Victorius, now in the Royal Library at Munich. The critical value of Wagner's edition <bibl default="NO">(London, 1869)</bibl> is somewhat impaired by carelessuess; but the text contains some improvements upon that of Fleckeisen. The edition of Umpfenbach <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1870)</bibl> was far in advance of all that had gone before it, and is based almost exclusively on the text of the Codex Bembinus. But the latest and most trustworthy text of the six plays is that of Dziatzko <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1884)</bibl>. In this the editor makes full recognition of the labours of Umpfenbach, and attaches due importance to the readings of the Bembine manuscript. Separate annotated editions of the <bibl default="NO"><title>Phormio</title> (1874, revised 1884)</bibl> and the <bibl default="NO"><title>Adelphoe</title> (1881)</bibl> have been published by the same scholar; and A. Spengel has edited the <title>Adelphoe</title> and <title>Andria</title> (Berlin, 1879 and 1888 respectively) with considerable critical acumen. Other (collective) editions are the <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> <bibl default="NO">(Strassburg, 1470)</bibl>, and those of Muretus <bibl default="NO">(Venice, 1555)</bibl>, F.

Pandion, king of Attica, who had two daughters, Philomela and Procné, called in the assistance of Tereus against some enemy, and gave him his daughter Procné in marriage. Tereus became by her the father of Itys, and then concealed her in the country, that he might dishonour her sister Philomela, whom he deceived by saying that Procné was dead. At the same time he deprived Philomela of her tongue. (For a different version of the story, cf. Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

Procné thereupon killed her own son Itys, and served up the flesh of the child in a dish before Tereus. She then fled with her sister. Tereus pursued them with an axe, and when the sisters were overtaken they prayed to the gods to change them into birds. Procné, accordingly, became a nightingale, Philomela a swallow, and Tereus a hoopoe ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.14.8" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.14.8</bibl>; Tzetz. <title>Chil.</title> vii. 142, 459; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

<head orig="Termĭnus">Terminus</head>

 <p> The Roman god of boundaries and frontiers, under whose special protection were the stones (<seg lang="la">termini</seg>) which marked territorial limits. The regulations respecting these stones and the religious customs and institutions connected with them went back to the time of Numa Pompilius. At the setting of such a stone all those living near the boundary assembled, and in their presence the hole prepared for the reception of the stone was watered with the blood of a sacrificial animal; incense, field-produce, honey, and wine were sprinkled over it, and a victim sacrificed. The stone, anointed and decked with garlands and ribbons, was then placed upon the smouldering bones and pressed into the earth. Whoever pulled up the stone was cursed, together with his draught-cattle, and any one might kill him with impunity and without being defiled by his blood. In later times the punishment of fines was instituted instead.</p>
 <p>The festival of the <ref type="cross" target="crossterminalia">Terminalia</ref> was celebrated in Rome and in the country on the 23d of February ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 74" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 74</bibl>). The neighbours on either side of any boundary gathered round the landmark, with their wives, children, and servants, and crowned it, each on his own side, with garlands, and offered cakes and bloodless sacrifices. In later times, however, a lamb or sucking-pig was sometimes slain, and the stone sprinkled with the blood. Lastly, the whole neighbourhood joined in a general feast. A lamb was also sacrificed in the grove of Terminus, which was six Roman miles from Rome, near the ancient border of the town of Laurentum (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, ii. 639;  <bibl n="Hor. Epod. 2. 59" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Epod.</title>ii. 59</bibl>). On the Capitol there was a stone dedicated to Terminus, which had originally stood in the open air, but when the Temple of Iupiter was founded by the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, it was enclosed within the building, as the augurs would not allow it to be removed (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 55</bibl>; Varro, <title>L.

 of terra-cotta. The greater part of the ancient terra-cottas now remaining consist of “figurines” or statuettes representing domestic deities, and also a great variety of models in various colours— white, green, and brown.

 <head><surname full="yes">Tertulliānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Q. Septimius Florens</foreName>
 <p>, usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tertullian</hi>, the most ancient of the Latin Christian Fathers now extant. Notwithstanding the celebrity which he has always enjoyed, our knowledge of his personal history is extremely limited, and is derived almost exclusively from a succinct notice by St. Jerome. From this we learn that Tertullian was a native of Carthage, the son of a proconsular centurion (a sort of aide-de-camp to provincial governors); that he wrote chiefly during the reigns of Septimius Severus and of Caracalla; that he became a presbyter, and remained orthodox until he had reached the term of middle life, when, in consequence of the envy and illtreatment which he experienced on the part of the Roman clergy, he went over to the sect of the Montanists (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmontanus">Montanus</ref>), and wrote several books in defence of these heretics; that he lived to a great age, and was the author of many works. His birth may be placed about A.D. 160, and his death about 240. The most interesting of his numerous <cb /> works is his <title>Apologeticum</title>, or defence of Christianity. It was written at Carthage, probably about A.D. 200. Other treatises of his that are of especial value as throwing light on the history of his times and upon questions of antiquities are the <title>Ad Nationes</title>, the <title>De Idololatria</title>, the <title>De Spectaculis</title>, and the <title>Adversus Iudaeos.</title></p>
 <p>Tertullian is an interesting figure—a Puritan of the early Church—stern, uncompromising, and filled with a passionate religious fervour which makes some of his declamatory passages read like the exhortations of a Mucklewrath or a Macbriar. His Latinity is also worthy of careful study, as being a good specimen of the literary African, strongly tinged with an Hebraic colouring. It is he who first coined the Latin ecclesiastical terminology to which St. Augustine gave currency a little later. He quotes the Bible freely from a current translation into Latin now lost, and known as the <title>Itala.</title> See <ref type="cross" target="crosshieronymus">Hieronymus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossitala">Itala</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>.</p>

<div2 id="crosstestamentum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Testamentum">Testamentum</head>

 <p> A will. In order to be able to make a valid Roman will, the testator had to have the <hi rend="italic">testamentifactio</hi>, a term expressing the legal capacity to make a valid will. The <hi rend="italic">testamentifactio</hi> was the privilege only of Roman citizens who were <hi rend="italic">patresfamilias.</hi> The following persons consequently had not the <hi rend="italic">testamentifactio:</hi> those who were in the <seg lang="la">potestas</seg> or <seg lang="la">manus</seg> of another, or in <seg lang="la">mancipii causa</seg>, as sons and daughters, wives <seg lang="la">in manu</seg>, and slaves; Latini Iuniani and Dediticii; Peregrini who could not dispose of their property according to the form of a Roman will; and an <seg lang="la">impubes</seg> or minor could not dispose of his property by will even with the consent of his tutor. When a male was fourteen years of age, he obtained the <hi rend="italic">testamentifactio</hi>, and a female obtained the power, subject to certain restraints, on the completion of her twelfth year: deaf and dumb persons and lunatics (<seg lang="la">muti, surdi, furiosi</seg>, and <seg lang="la">prodigi</seg>) had not the <hi rend="italic">testamentifactio.</hi> In order to constitute a valid will, it was necessary that an heir (<seg lang="la">heres</seg>) should be instituted, which might be done in such terms as follows: <title>Titius heres esto; Titium heredem esse iubeo.</title> Originally there were two modes of making wills; either at the Comitia Calata, which were appointed twice a year for that purpose, or <seg lang="la">in procinctu</seg>—that is, when a man was going to battle. A third mode of making wills was introduced which was effected <seg lang="la">per aes et libram</seg>, whence the name of <seg lang="la">testamentum per aes et libram.</seg> <cb /> If a man had neither made his will at the Comitia Calata nor <seg lang="la">in procinctu</seg>, and was in imminent danger of death, he would mancipate (<seg lang="la">mancipio dabat</seg>) his <seg lang="la">familia</seg>—that is, his patrimonium—to a friend, and would tell him what he wished to be given to each person after his death. There seems to have been no rule of law that a testament must be written. The heir might either be made by oral declaration (<seg lang="la">nuncupatio</seg>) or by writing. Written wills, however, were the common form among the Romans, at least in the later republican and in the imperial periods. They were written on tablets of wood or wax, whence the word <seg lang="la">cera</seg> is often used as equivalent to <seg lang="la">tabella;</seg> and the expressions <seg lang="la">prima, secunda cera</seg> are equivalent to <seg lang="la">prima, secunda pagina.</seg> The will must have been in some way so marked as to be recognized, and the practice of the witnesses (<seg lang="la">testes</seg>) sealing and signing the will at last became common. It was necessary for the witnesses both to seal (<seg lang="la">signare</seg>) —that is, to make a mark with a ring (<seg lang="la">anulus</seg>) or something else on the wax—and to add their names (<seg lang="la">adscribere</seg>). Wills were to be tied with a triple thread (<seg lang="la">linum</seg>) on the upper part of the margin, which was to be perforated at the middle part, and the wax was to be put over the thread and sealed. Tablets which were produced in any other way had no validity. A man might make several copies of his will, which was often done for the sake of caution. When sealed, it was deposited with some friend, or in a temple, or with the Vestal Virgins; and after the testator's death it was opened (<seg lang="la">resignare</seg>) in due form. The witnesses or the major part were present, and after they had acknowledged their seals, the thread (<seg lang="la">linum</seg>) was broken and the will was opened and read, and a copy was made; the original was then sealed with the public seal and placed in the <seg lang="la">archium</seg>, whence a fresh copy might be had, if the first copy should ever be lost.

 <p> “The last will of a little pig.” The title of a <hi rend="italic">jeu d'esprit</hi> in Latin written before the fourth century A.D. and found in a MS. of the ninth century.

The document is attested in due form by seven pigs. It is evidently intended for children, for it has the real nursery ring, though some have supposed it to be written as a burlesque of legal forms. St. Jerome (<title>Comment. in Is.</title> xii. init.) says that it was repeated by boys at school exhibitions as an amusing bit of fun.

 unbroken surface without any interstices between them, and were also so firm that men could walk upon them, and even horses and chariots be driven over them. A testudo was formed (<seg lang="la">testudinem facere</seg>) either in battle to ward off the arrows and other missiles of the enemy, or, which was more frequently the case, to form a protection to the soldiers when they advanced to the walls or gates of a town for the purpose of attacking them. Sometimes the shields were disposed in such a way as to make the testudo slope. The soldiers in the first line stood upright, those in the second stooped a little, and each line successively was a little lower than the preceding down to the last, where the soldiers rested on one knee. Such a disposition of the shields was called <seg lang="la">fastigata testudo</seg>, on account of their sloping like the roof of a building. The advantages of this plan were obvious: the stones and missiles thrown upon the shields rolled off them like water from a roof; besides which, other soldiers frequently advanced upon them to attack the enemy upon the walls. The Romans were accustomed to form this kind of testudo, as an exercise, in the games of the Circus (Livy , xliv. 9).

After the introduction of the Satyric <ref type="cross" target="crossdrama">Drama</ref> (q.v.), this, or a drama of a comparatively cheerful character (such as the <title>Alcestis</title> of Euripides), formed the fourth piece of three tragedies or of a trilogy.

<div2 id="crosstextual-criticism" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Textual Criticism">Textual Criticism</head>

 <p> The criticism of a classical author with a view to establish a sound and defensible text is of two kinds, each of which supplements and aids the other. The first is <hi rend="SmallCaps">Diplomatic Criticism</hi>, which has to do with the age, authenticity, and value of the existing manuscripts (<seg lang="la">diplomata</seg>); and the second is <hi rend="SmallCaps">Verbal</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Grammatical Criticism</hi>, which alters the text in order to make it conform to good sense or to the laws of the language, or to the critic's conception of what the author meant to say. The former is based upon Palaeography; the second in part upon the science of Philology and in part upon aesthetic principles. Wolff and Boeckh classified the former as “Superior” criticism, and the latter as “Inferior,” but this terminology is not generally accepted. The best text-critic is he who can bring to bear upon his task a minute palaeographical knowledge and at the same time linguistic training and a sound literary sense.</p>
 <p>Textual criticism in Greece originated in the necessity that was felt of a unification and collation of the various versions of the Homeric poems. Homer was to the Greeks much more than a poet; he was long regarded as a great teacher of practical and also of ethical wisdom, and he was read and studied in the schools in much the same spirit as a Christian would study the Bible, or a Mohammedan the Korân. Owing to the fact that the Homeric poems were largely transmitted orally and to the additional fact that the rhapsodists who recited them in public frequently altered the text to suit the special occasion or their own notion of <cb /> an effective arrangement, there were many versions current even in very early times. It has been inferred that Solon took some steps toward the establishing of an Homeric canon (Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Hipparch. 228" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hipparch.</title>228</bibl>B; <bibl n="Diog.  1. 57" default="NO">Diog. Laert.i. 57</bibl>), and Pisistratus and his son Hipparchus are said to have intrusted a recension of the text to a commission of four scholars who were to edit and unify the poems. (See Flach, <title>Pisistratos und seine litterarische Thätigkeit</title> [Tübingen, 1885], and the article <ref type="cross" target="crosshomerus">Homerus</ref>.) This recension is thought to have formed the basis of the famous “City Editions” (q. v.) which in turn were worked over by the Alexandrian scholars. Other special texts were made by Theagenes of Rhegium, Stesimbrotus of Thasos (c. 450 B.C.), and by Aristotle, who prepared a version for the use of his pupil Alexander the Great, usually called <foreign lang="greek">ἡ ἐκ νάρθηκος</foreign> from the case in which it was kept ( <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Alex.</title>8</bibl>; cf. Cope's introduction to Aristotle's <title>Rhetoric</title>). Demetrius Phalereus also edited the <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title>, while the Sophists spent considerable time in the critical study of Homer. (See Friedel, <title>De Sophistarum Studiis Homericis</title> [Halle, 1873]). At about this time criticism was also applied to the texts of other great writers—to those of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—of whom an authentic text was promulgated by the orator and statesman Lycurgus, about B.C. 350, which was the only one allowed to be used by the actors. (See Korn, <title>De Aeschyli, Sophoclis, Euripidis Fabularum Exemplari Lycurgo Auctore Confecto</title> [Bonn, 1863].) Commentaries were also written on special points by the Stoics and by the Cynics.</p>
 <p>A more definite and scientific criticism was that undertaken by the philological section of the School at Alexandria (see <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>), and in connection with the great Alexandrian Library (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbibliotheca">Bibliotheca</ref>), for which great quantities of manuscripts were purchased by King Ptolemy at the advice of Demetrius Phalereus. All of the early heads of the School worked at text-recension. Zenodotus of Ephesus (B.C. 325-260) published a collection of Homeric glosses (see <ref type="cross" target="crossglossa">Glossa</ref>), and about B.C. 274 put forth a <foreign lang="greek">διόρθωσις</foreign> or recension of both the <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title>, also called the <foreign lang="greek">ἔκδοσις Ὁμήρου</foreign>. In this, four kinds of corrections appear: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Elimination or the omission of lines known to be spurious; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Query or the indication of doubtful lines; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Transposition or a change in the order of the lines; and (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Emendation or the substitution of new readings for the old. See Düntzer, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Zenodoti Studiis Homericis</title> (Göttingen, 1848)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The existing texts were classified and characterized in the <foreign lang="greek">Πίνακες</foreign> of Callimachus, the first great bibliographical work ever written; and Eratosthenes of Cyrené (c. 276-196 B.C.) wrote a critical treatise on the poets of the Old Comedy. He was succeeded by Aristophanes of Byzantium (c. 257- 180 B.C.), perhaps the greatest philologist of antiquity. His criticism was partly diplomatic and partly verbal; and was guided always by the <hi rend="italic">sentiment critique.</hi> He did much for both text-criticism and for language-study in general. To him is ascribed the invention of diacritical marks and symbols (<foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα κριτικά</foreign>), all of great palaeographic importance.

His critical work included an edition of Homer (a second <foreign lang="greek">διόρθωσις</foreign>), and also editions of Hesiod (the <title>Theogony</title>), Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Euripides, Aristophanes, and perhaps Simonides and Menander. The famous Alexandrian Canon was in part his work. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanon-alexandrinus">Canon Alexandrinus</ref>.</p>
 <p>His great pupil Aristarchus of Samothrace (c. 217-143 B.C.) did much for the study of formal grammar (see <ref type="cross" target="crossgrammatica">Grammatica</ref>), and also edited Archilochus, Alcaeus, Hesiod, Pindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, and especially the Homeric poems, of which he put forth two separate recensions, writing <foreign lang="greek">συγγράμματα</foreign> or special monographs, besides the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκδόσεις</foreign> (texts) and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπομνήματα</foreign> (commentaries). Aristarchus approached his task in a skeptical spirit, and employed five processes: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">διόρθωσις</foreign> or arrangement of the text; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάγνωσις</foreign> or determination of accents; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">τέχνη</foreign>, determination of forms and questions of syntax; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐξήγησις</foreign> or explanation of words, allusions, etc.; and (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) <foreign lang="greek">κρίσις</foreign>, the determination of all questions respecting authenticity or integrity of the text, and the final judgment of the author as a whole. Aristarchus used a number of critical symbols in his work. Among them were the <foreign lang="greek">ὀβελός</foreign> or spit (—) to mark a spurious line; the <foreign lang="greek">διπλῆ</foreign> (<figure />) to call attention to some special point; the dotted <foreign lang="greek">διπλῆ</foreign> (<figure />) to denote a variant from the reading of Zenodotus; and the <foreign lang="greek">ἀστέρισκος</foreign> (*) to denote a “formulaic” line. Of the 15,600 lines of the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title>, Aristarchus “athetized,” i. e. struck out as spurious, 1160. See Gardthausen, <title>Palaeographie</title>, pp. 288 foll. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1879)</bibl>; and on Aristarchus in general Lehrs, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Aristarchi Studiis Homericis</title> (Königsberg, 1833; 2d ed. 1882)</bibl>; Ludwich, <bibl default="NO"><title>Aristarch's homer.

Lit.</title> i. pp. 35-39 <bibl default="NO">(New York, 1880)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The later Alexandrians did also much careful work in the recension of texts, and so did the rival School of Pergamus, headed by Crates of Mallos, the “Anomalist” (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscrates">Crates</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphilologia">Philologia</ref>), who flourished in B.C. 168. (See Wagener, <title>De Aula Attalica</title> [1836].) Didymus Chalcenteros (B.C. 65- A.D. 10) is the last of the important Greek text critics. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdidymus">Didymus</ref>.</p>
 <p>From the Greeks the Romans received the principles of textual criticism, and early began to apply these principles to the study of Latin works. Lucius Aelius Stilo investigated the text of the <title>Carmina Saliaria;</title> M. Antonius Griphus wrote commentaries on the <title>Annales</title> of Ennius. Cicero is said to have prepared an edition of Lucretius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslucretius-carus">Lucretius</ref>.) To Varro we owe the establishment of a Plautine Canon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossplautus">Plautus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvarro">Varro</ref>.) The greatest of the Roman text-critics was M. Valerius Probus Berytus (c. 80 A.D.), who edited, with critical signs, Vergil, Horace, Lucretius, and Terence, and wrote a treatise on the <foreign lang="greek">σημεῖα κριτικά</foreign>. (See Suet. <title>Reliq.</title> p. 138, Reifferscheid; and the introduction to Conington's Vergil, i. pp. lxv. foll.) Glossography also flourished greatly among the Romans. See <ref type="cross" target="crossglossa">Glossa</ref>; Scholia ; <ref type="cross" target="crosssubscriptio">Subscriptio</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the first period of the Renaissance in Italy the study of texts revived during the corruption of existing manuscripts. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrenaissance">Renaissance</ref>.) <cb /> Among these early critics are Laurentius <ref type="cross" target="crossvalla">Valla</ref> (q.v.) and <ref type="cross" target="crosspolitianus">Politianus</ref> (q.v.). The critical acumen of scholars was much sharpened by the immense number of forged texts that began to appear. A single forger, Annius of Viterbo, alone put forth seventeen volumes of spurious works ascribed by him to the classical writers. (See Wachler in Ersch and Gruber's <title>Encyclopädie.</title>) Gradually a scientific basis for textual criticism was established, the great names in this process being those belonging to the so-called French or Polyhistorical School, the Scaligers, Lambinus, Salmasius, and Casaubon; and to the Anglo-Dutch or Critical School, Gronovius, Burmann, Hemsterhuys, and especially Richard Bentley. In more recent times, the important names are those of I. Bekker, Boeckh, Lachmann, Ritschl, Madvig, Cobet, Porson, Munro, Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, and Vahlen. See especially the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossbentley">Bentley</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslachmann">Lachmann</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossscaliger">Scaliger</ref>.</p>
 <p>Text-critics are generally to be classified according to the relative importance which they give to the subjective element in their criticism. Bentley, who is the father of the subjective method, in his later work largely disregarded the evidence of manuscripts in his determination of the proper lections, depending largely upon his own instinctive feeling as to what an author must have said. He has expressed this principle in a formal phrase —<title>Nobis et ratio et res ipsa centum codicibus potiores sunt</title>—and in following this out he did much that was rash and indefensible as well as much that is brilliant and convincing. The <seg lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</seg> of this subjective method will be found in Bentley's edition of Milton's <title>Paradise Lost</title>, in which he rewrote whole passages, because of reasons based on his own conception of what Milton must in reality have said. See Jebb's <bibl default="NO"><title>Bentley</title> (New York, 1882)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>The school that represents the antithesis of the Bentleian principle is that of which the Jesuit scholars of France stand as a type. These held to what they called <seg lang="la">la tradition classique</seg>, and studied to avoid any radical changes in a text whatever, going so far as to force an explanation of passages that evidently violate the laws of the ancient languages, history, and good sense. The Bentleians rewrite everything; the other school explains everything; and each set must be regarded as often equally unreasonable.</p>

<head orig="Thales">Thales</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θαλῆς</foreign>). An Ionian, the founder of Greek philosophy. He was a contemporary of Solon and Croesus, and one of the Seven Sages, and was born at Miletus about B.C. 636, and died about 546, at the age of ninety, though the exact dates of his birth and death are not known. He is said to have predicted the eclipse of the sun which happened in the reign of the Lydian king Alyattes; to have diverted the course of the Halys in the time of Croesus; and later, in order to unite the Ionians when threatened by the Persians, to have instituted a federal council in Teos. Aristotle preserves a story of his knowledge of meteorology which was turned to a practical use <bibl default="NO">(Polyb. i. 11, p. 1259)</bibl>. In the lists of the Seven Sages his name seems to have stood at the head, and he displayed his wisdom both by political sagacity and by prudence in acquiring wealth. In mathematics we find attributed to him only proofs of propositions which belong to the first elements of geometry, and which could not possibly have enabled him to calculate the eclipses of the sun and the course of the heavenly bodies. He may, however, have obtained a knowledge of the higher branches of mathematics from Egypt, which country he is said to have visited. In the annals of Greek philosophy he was probably the first who looked for a physical origin of the world instead of resting upon mythology. Thales maintained that water is the origin (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>) of things, meaning thereby that it is water out of which everything arises and into which everything resolves itself, and that the earth floated upon the water. Thales left no works behind him ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 74</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  170" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 170</bibl>; <bibl n="Diog.  1. 25" default="NO">Diog.

<div2 id="crossthargelia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Thargelia">Thargelia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θαργήλια</foreign>). The principal feast of Apollo in Athens, held on the seventh day of the month Thargelion (May-June), the birthday of the god. Originally it was connected with the ripening of the field-produce. A procession was formed, and the first-fruits of the year were offered to Apollo, together with Artemis and the Horae. It was at the same time an expiatory feast, at which a peculiar propitiatory sacrifice was offered, which was to purify the State from all guilt, and avert the wrath of the god, lest he should exercise his avenging and destroying power in burning up the harvest with parching heat, and in visiting the people with pestilence. Two persons, condemned to death, a man and a woman, as representatives of the male and female population, were led about with a garland of figs round their necks to the sound of flutes and singing, and scourged with seaweed and with the branches of a fig-tree. They were then sacrificed at a certain spot on the seashore, their bodies burned, and the ashes cast into the sea. In later times they seem to have been contented with throwing the victims (<foreign lang="greek">φαρμακοί</foreign>) from a height into the sea, catching them as they fell, and banishing them from the country. Besides these sacrifices, festal processions and choral contests between men and boys took place. At the same time the great feast of Apollo was probably held at Delos, to which the Athenians sent a sacred embassy in the ancient ship in which Theseus is said to have sailed to Crete, and which was always kept in repair. See Preller, <title>Griechische Mythologie</title>, i. 209; and A. Mommsen, <title>Heortologie</title>, 50, 53, 414-425.

An island in the north of the Aegaean Sea, off the coast of Thrace, and opposite the mouth of the river Nestus. It was at a very early period taken possession of by the Phoenicians, on account of its valuable gold-mines. According to tradition the Phoenicians were led by Thasus, son of Poseidon or Agenor, who came from the East in search of Europa, and from whom the island derived its name. Thasos was afterwards colonized by the Parians, B.C. 708, and among the colonists was the poet Archilochus. The Thracians once possessed a considerable territory on the coast of Thrace, and were one of the richest and most powerful peoples in the north of the Aegaean. They were subdued by the Persians under Mardonius, and subsequently became part of the Athenian maritime empire. They revolted, however, from Athens in B.C. 465, and, after sustaining a siege of three years, were subdued by Cimon in 463. They again revolted from Athens in 411, and called in the Spartans; but the island was again restored to the Athenians by Thrasybulus in 407.

<div2 id="crosstheatrum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Theātrum">Theatrum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θέατρον</foreign>). The architectural form of the Greek theatre was developed from the circular dancing-place, the <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχήστρα</foreign>, used by the Bacchic dancers. At first there was no Chorus distinct from the general body of worshippers, all of whom were free to join in the dance. As soon, however, as a regular Chorus was instituted, it became necessary to reserve a circular space of ground for it. A ring of stones sufficed to mark off this circle. The altar of Dionysus was placed at its centre. The spectators stood around it and watched the dance. So long as the dramatic element was limited to a dialogue between the Chorus and one actor, that <cb /> person could stand on a raised place in the middle of the Chorus and address himself to various points of the circle in turn; but when Aeschylus added a second actor, it became necessary that the actors should play towards some one side. It was then no longer possible that the spectators should form a complete circle, but they were now arranged in a semicircle, or something like it, though the whole circle of the dancing-place was still, as of old, kept clear for the Chorus. The actors stood facing the spectators, not within the circle of the dancingplace, but on the farther side of it. Behind them was the tent or booth (<foreign lang="greek">σκηνή</foreign>) in which they dressed. It was an easy improvement to conceal this tent from the spectators by a modern screen which could represent the front of a house or anything else that suited the requirements of the play. This screen was the <seg lang="la">proscaenium</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">προσκήνιον</foreign>), i. e. that which masked the <foreign lang="greek">σκηνή</foreign>. The term was retained in the later history of the theatre, though its primitive sense was lost. The <seg lang="la">proscaenium</seg> was the background visible to the spectators, whether it was a temporary screen or a permanent wall. Then <foreign lang="greek">σκηνή</foreign> came to denote that part of the theatre which belonged to the actors, as distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχήστρα</foreign>, the place of the Chorus. Aristotle ( <bibl n="Suet. Poet. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title>24</bibl>) uses the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ σκηνῆς</foreign> where we should say “on the stage.”</p>
 <p>The oldest theatre of which we have any knowledge is the Dionysiac Theatre at Athens. It has generally been supposed that a permanent stone theatre existed in the <foreign lang="greek">Λήναιον</foreign>, or precinct of Dionysus, from the early years of the fifth century B.C., a belief resting on a passage in Suidas (s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Πρατίνας</foreign>). But the history of the Dionysiac Theatre has been placed in a new light by the recent researches of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. Its excavations, begun in 1886, have yielded the following results: (1) In the fifth century B.C., and down to about B.C. 330, the precinct contained no permanent building for scenic purposes, but there was near it a circular <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχήστρα</foreign>, about seventy-eight feet in diameter, of which traces have been found under the buildings erected by Lycurgus. This <foreign lang="greek">ὀρχήστρα</foreign> was then the only permanent provision for drama. All scenery, therefore, was temporary, and the spectators sat on wooden benches.</p>
 <p>(2) The first permanent building for the drama in the <foreign lang="greek">Λήναιον</foreign> was that completed by Lycurgus, about B.C. 330. It consisted of a stone wall with two small wings, like towers, projecting from it on right and left (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a, a</hi>); the length of the wall between them was about sixty-five feet seven inches. The temporary decorations (of wood, with linen hangings) were erected in front of this wall, and supported by the wings. Behind the wall was an oblong room, extending somewhat beyond the wings, and serving for the use of the actors. A portico (<hi rend="SmallCaps">c, c</hi>), opening on the precinct of Dionysus, ran along the south side of it. The new orchestra was to the north of this building. Dr. Dörpfeld supposes that it formed, like the older one, a complete circle, and that there was no raised stage; the actors stood on the same level with the Chorus. Rows of stone seats for the spectators were now constructed. After the time of Lycurgus no change, except of detail, took place in the auditorium.</p>
 <p>(3) At some later date, which cannot be fixed, a permanent stone proscenium (<hi rend="SmallCaps">b</hi>), adorned with columns, and about ten or twelve feet high, was built in front of the wall with projecting wings 
<pb n="1550" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01550">
<head orig="Dionysiac Theatre at Athens.">Dionysiac Theatre at Athens.</head>
</figure>
 which Lycurgus had erected. As the wings no longer served a practical purpose (in supporting the temporary scenery), they were annexed to the new proscenium, a part being cut off the front of each, so as to bring them more nearly into line with it.</p>
 <p>(4) An architrave-inscription found in the theatre shows that it was modified and embellished in the reign of “Claudius,” by whom Nero seems to be meant. It was probably at this time that the orchestra received its present pavement of Pentelic and Hymettus marble. To this period also is referred the erection of a raised stage, supported in front by a sculptured wall.</p>
 <p>(5) The latest recorded changes in the Dionysiac Theatre are associated with the name of a certain Phaedrus, and took place probably in the third century (<title>C. I. A.</title> iii. 239). To these belong the existing front wall of the stage, adorned with sculpture of an earlier period; also the balustrade which now separates the auditorium from the orchestra, and the partial covering of the orchestra-canal with marble flags.</p>
 <p>It is maintained by Dr. Dörpfeld that, not only <figure id="fig.01550.2">
<head orig="Marble Sculptures on Front Wall of Stage, Dionysiac Theatre.">Marble Sculptures on Front Wall of Stage, Dionysiac Theatre.</head>
</figure> <cb /> in the Dionysiac Theatre, but in all theatres of the Greek type, the actors stood on the same level with the Chorus; a stage raised above the orchestra was a Roman invention; and where such a stage occurs in a theatre of Greek origin, it is a later addition, made under Roman influence. The Roman raised stage, he thinks, was developed, when a Chorus was no longer used, by depressing the level of the circular orchestra in that part of it—the part farthest from the actors—where the Chorus formerly stood. This startling theory is based chiefly on the nature of the proscenium as it appears in the remains of some Greek theatres. The theatre of Epidaurus, built about the middle of the fourth century B.C., is the best-preserved example of the Greek type; excavations were made in it by the Greek Archaeological Society in 1883.</p>
 <p>The orchestra forms a complete circle, defined by a ring of flat stones. Beyond this circle, on the side farthest from the audience, are remains of a wall, about twelve feet high, adorned with Ionic half-columns, and flanked by slightly projecting wings; there was one door in it, at the middle point. This wall must have been either the background of the scene, or the front of a raised stage. It is argued that it must have been the background, because (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) twelve feet would be too great a height for a stage; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the width of the stage—about eight feet—would have been too small; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) there is no trace of steps leading from the top of the wall to the orchestra. A similar wall occurs in the theatre at Oropus, and is identified as the proscenium by an inscription which it bears. The theatre in the Piraeus affords another example.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, several considerations tell in favour of the received view, that Greek actors, at every period, had a raised stage. (1) The statement of the architect Vitruvius, who wrote about A.D. 20, is decisive, so far as the Roman period is concerned. He states that the Greek theatre had a raised stage, about ten or twelve feet high, but narrower than the Roman; the Greeks, he says, called it <foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign>. Vitruvius uses the word <seg lang="la">proscaenium</seg> to describe this stage; and the same use of the term occurs in other writers, both Roman and Greek. Dr. Dörpfeld is therefore reduced to assuming that Vitruvius has made a mistake—confusing the background of the scene in a Greek theatre with the front of a raised stage. But it is absurd to suppose that Vitruvius should have made such a blunder about the Greek theatres of his 
<pb n="1551" /><cb /> own day; and that, having accurately described a raised stage which did not exist, he should also have invented a name for it, <foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign>.</p>
 <p>(2) The theatre at Megalopolis in Arcadia has lately been excavated by members of the British School at Athens <bibl default="NO">(see the report of the School for 1890)</bibl>. The date of this theatre may be placed in the second half of the fourth century B.C. Here there is a raised stage, of which the height was originally about six feet, and the width about eighteen feet. A flight of steps, extending from end to end of it, led down to the orchestra. That it was a stage, and not a background, is proved (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) by these steps, (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) by the fact that access was given to it by three doors in the wall behind it. There is no reason to doubt that this stage is of the same date as the auditorium. A later Roman stage has been found in front of it. By this example, then, the existence of a raised stage in a Greek theatre of the fourth century B.C. is placed beyond doubt.</p>
 <p>(3) With regard to the fifth century B.C., it was not to be expected that any remains of a raised stage should be found; temporary wooden structures would leave no trace. The Greek plays do not supply any literary evidence which can be deemed conclusive. There are some passages which indicate that the place where the actors stood was accessible to the Chorus (e.g. <bibl n="Soph. OC 836" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Col.</title> 836</bibl> foll.); as would be the case if we supposed a stage with steps leading up to it, as at Megalopolis. Among the passages which seem to imply a raised stage, we may notice  <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 1514" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>1514</bibl>, where Philocleon says, <foreign lang="greek">ἀτὰρ καταβατέον γ ἐπ αὐτούς</foreign>. This may, indeed, be rendered, “I must <seg lang="la">enter the lists</seg> against them”; but it also implies some change of position, more marked than such as would consist in moving merely from one spot in the orchestra to another, and would be most naturally explained by a descent into the orchestra from the stage. Some vases of Lower Italy, referable to the period B.C. 300-100, depict scenes from the Old Attic Comedy acted on a raised <foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign> (cf. Baumeister, <title>Denkmäler</title>, pp. 1750 foll.). Plato ( <title>Symp.</title>p. 194 A) speaks of the tragic poet Agathon as <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβαίνοντος ἐπὶ ὀκρίβαντα μετὰ τῶν ὑποκριτῶν</foreign>. This shows that the idea of placing actors on a raised platform was familiar to Athenians of the fifth century B.C. Even in the days before Thespis , when one member of the Chorus held a dialogue with the rest, he was mounted, we are told, on a kind of table (<foreign lang="greek">ἐλεός</foreign>). A recent writer suggests that the source of this story may have been a Comedy in which the beginnings of Tragedy were burlesqued (Hiller, <title>Rhein. Museum</title>, xxxix. p. 329). If this were so, it would only show that some sort of raised stage was conceived as necessary for even the most primitive form of drama. Lastly, there is a strong <seg lang="la">a priori</seg> objection to the theory that actors and Chorus stood on the same level. The Chorus was usually drawn up in ranks facing the actors. With his <seg lang="la">cothurnus</seg> and mask, a tragic actor would still not overtop the Chorus by more than a head. Hence, a view of the actors would have almost been wholly denied to spectators whose seats were in the middle <cb /> part of the lowest row. But those were the seats assigned to the most distinguished persons. This argument cannot he met by saying, as Dr. Dörpfeld does, that the Chorus was “usually” divided into <foreign lang="greek">ἡμιχόρια</foreign> (leaving the actors visible between the two groups). Such an arrangement was not usual, but very exceptional. It may be allowed that, when the stage came to be as high as twelve feet, permanent means of communication between stage and orchestra cannot have existed, though temporary wooden steps might be employed at need. But before stages of that height came into use, such communication had ceased to be requisite, since the Chorus had no longer an active part in drama.</p>
 <p>Vitruvius gives the ground-plan of a Greek theatre as follows: describe a circle for the orchestra, and in it inscribe three squares. One side of one of these squares will represent the front line of the stage (a b). A parallel tangent to the circle will be the back wall of the stage (c d). The stage (<seg lang="la">pulpitum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign>) must be not less than ten or more than twelve feet high. Next, parallel with a b, draw a diameter of the circle, e f. It will be seen in the diagram that at e and f the semicircle is so continued as to make a horseshoe, ending at g h. The curves which thus continue it are segments of circles described from e and f as respective centres, with e f as radius. This is known as “the construction from three centres,” viz., e, f, <figure id="fig.01551">
<head orig="Greek Theatre, after Vitruvius.">Greek Theatre, after Vitruvius.</head>
</figure> and the centre of the orchestra. The auditorium is shut in by lines which bisect the right angles at i and k. The space between g h and c d is a raised stage.</p>
 <p>The fourth century B.C. was the period at which stone theatres became usual in Greece. We may now proceed to consider their characteristics more in detail.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Orchestra</hi>.—It has been seen that, even in the matured theatre, the “dancing-place” was still a complete circle, as in the old days of the Cyclic Choruses. Its central point was sometimes marked, either by a small pit (as at the Piraeus), or by a stone (as at Epidaurus). Such marks probably indicate the spot on which the altar of Dionysus was to be placed. The word <foreign lang="greek">θυμέλη</foreign>, “a place of sacrifice,” means in classical poetry either “a shrine,” or, more specifically, “an altar.” The 
<pb n="1552" /><cb />
 most probable conclusion is that the <foreign lang="greek">θυμέλη</foreign> was the altar of Dionysus, in the centre of the orchestra. Another view is that the name <foreign lang="greek">θυμέλη</foreign> was transferred from the altar to a platform in the orchestra on which the altar was placed, and that this platform was the station of the Chorus—connected by steps with the lower level of the orchestra (<foreign lang="greek">κονίστρα</foreign>) and with the higher level of the stage (<foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign>). It is true that the use of <foreign lang="greek">θυμέλη</foreign> to denote a kind of stage was current in later times, when <seg lang="la">thymelici</seg>, “music-hall artists,” were distinguished from actors proper (Isidore, <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 18. 47" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xviii. 47</bibl>). But this use arose under Roman influences, and cannot be assumed for the Greece of the fifth or fourth century B.C. A channel, to carry off rain-water, often surrounded the orchestra, being bridged by stones at the points from which the stairways led up to the seats.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Auditorium</hi>.—In default of a special term like <seg lang="la">cavea</seg>, this is sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">θέατρον</foreign>: though that word, when it does not mean the whole building, more often denotes the spectators, as we speak of “the house.” In the older Greek theatres the public entered by the side-passages (<foreign lang="greek">πάροδοι</foreign>) between the proscenium and the orchestra—the same which the Chorus used. Sometimes, indeed, we find an alternative mode of access, viz. by a path traversing high ground, and leading directly to one of the upper tiers: this was the case at Athens. but it was exceptional. A crowd entering by the <foreign lang="greek">πάροδοι</foreign> would find the pressure greatest at the mouths of the semicircular passage between the orchestra and the lowest row of seats—before the spectators had distributed themselves to the several parts of the house. This fact helps to explain a peculiarity of construction. The lowest row of seats is not, as a rule, completely concentric with the orchestra, but is usually so contrived as to leave a wider space at the points just mentioned. A further advantage of this arrangement was that it afforded a better view to those who sat at each end of the semicircle.</p>
 <p>Flights of steps ascending from the orchestra to the highest tier of seats divided the auditorium into wedge-like segments. The Greek word for such a segment was <foreign lang="greek">κερκίς</foreign>, which properly meant “radius”; the Latin term was <seg lang="la">cuneus.</seg> A further division into upper and lower zones was effected by passages called <foreign lang="greek">διαζώματα</foreign>, “girdles” (<seg lang="la">praecinctiones</seg>), which ran completely round the semicircle. The word <foreign lang="greek">διάζωμα</foreign> can denote, not only the passage itself, but the zone which it marks off (<title>C. I. G.</title> 4283). Above the highest tier, another open passage ran round the house. The term <foreign lang="greek">ἴκρια</foreign> properly denoted the wooden benches on which, in the earlier times, the spectators sat. When stone seats were introduced (cir. B.C. 330), such seats were founded, where it was possible, on the natural rock of the slope. At Athens, as at Megalopolis, artificial substructions were required in several parts, and this must almost everywhere have been the case, more or less. The material used for the seats varied much. Sometimes it is marble, as at Iassus in Caria and Perga in Pamphylia; at Athens and in the Piraeus, it is a white limestone, finely wrought; while the smaller provincial theatres were often content with coarser stone and workmanship. The tiers of seats were called <foreign lang="greek">βάθρα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀναβαθμοί</foreign>. At Athens the space allotted to one person was indicated merely by a line engraved on the stone: it is described as <foreign lang="greek">ἕδρα, τόπος, χώρα, χωρίον</foreign>, or simply <foreign lang="greek">θέα</foreign>. <cb /></p>
 <p>The privilege of free seats (<foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>) in the theatre was given chiefly to four classes of persons: (1) certain priests and priestesses, among whom the priest of Dionysus was foremost; (2) certain magistrates; (3) foreigners who were honoured in an official character, as <foreign lang="greek">πρέσβεις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θεωροί</foreign>;  (4) citizens or foreigners who were honoured in their personal capacity, as benefactors of the State. For such persons special seats were provided, like armchairs, called <foreign lang="greek">θρόνοι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">καθέδραι</foreign>. At Athens these chairs, made of Pentelic marble, occupy the whole of the lowest row, while others are placed in different parts of the house, though in no case higher up than the twenty-fourth row; those assigned to priests or officials bear their titles. At Epidaurus several rows of seats with backs and arms were assigned to those who enjoyed <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The acoustic properties of a Greek theatre would be naturally good, since the actors had a high wall behind them and a rising slope in front. Vitruvius, indeed, says that artificial aid was sought from “brazen vessels,” “which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">ἠχεῖα</foreign>,” so placed in the auditorium as to reverberate the voices of the actors. He even speaks of these “resonators” as being nicely adapted to the required musical pitch (ii. 1, 9). The theatre at Aizani in Cilicia has a series of niches above the <foreign lang="greek">διάζωμα</foreign>: and similar niches exist elsewhere. According to one view, these niches held the <foreign lang="greek">ἠχεῖα</foreign>, while another connects them merely with the substructions of seats.</p>
 <p>The outer wall enclosing the auditorium ordinarily followed the curve of the semicircle, unless the nature of the ground caused some deviation. At Athens the auditorium was partly bounded on the north by the steep rock of the Acropolis, while the rest of its boundary was formed by strong walls of conglomerate. Where the external appearance of these walls became important, viz., in the south and southwestern portions, they were cased with finely wrought limestone. Examples occur in which the walls enclosing the auditorium were rectangular, as at Cnidus, and in the smaller theatre at Pompeii. The walls flanking the seats at each end of the semicircle were either carried in a single sloping line from the topmost tier to the orchestra, or built in a series of steps corresponding with the tiers. In the best Greek period such walls were not exactly parallel with the line of the proscenium, but started inwards a little, towards the centre of the orchestra. This was the case at Athens and Epidaurus.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Scenic Decoration</hi>.—The testimonies on this subject are of two classes. (1) Notices in writers chiefly belonging to the Roman age, especially lexicographers and scholiasts. Among these the most important is the grammarian Iulius Pollux (flour. A.D. 170), in his <title>Onomasticon</title>, book iv. 128-132. As has lately been shown by Rohde, the source principally used by Pollux was a work by Iuba, a writer of the later Alexandrian Age, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Θεατρικὴ Ἱστορία</foreign>, in at least seventeen books; while Iuba, in his turn, had sources going back to Aristophanes of Byzantium (B.C. 200), but not further. The besetting fault of Pollux, in abridging from this ample material, seems to have been an omission to distinguish between the normal and the occasional resources of the stage.</p>
 <p>(2) The second kind of evidence is that derived from the Greek dramatic texts themselves. This source, scanty as it is, is the principal one on which we have to 
<pb n="1553" /><cb />
 rely in regard to the practice of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Not long ago it was the custom to treat the notices in Pollux and the other late authorities as if they could be applied without reserve to the great age of Athenian Tragedy and Comedy, but a more critical study has shown the need of greater caution in this respect.</p>
 <p>In the extant plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, the action most often takes place in front of a house with a “practicable” door; sometimes in front of a temple, a cottage, a tent, a cave, or a rock. Painted linen hangings, erected on a wooden frame, would have sufficed for such a background. Aristotle, in sketching the growth of Tragedy, says that Aeschylus added the second actor, and made the dialogue predominate over the choral part, while Sophocles introduced the third actor and the use <figure id="fig.01553">
<head orig="Remains of Greek Theatre at Tauromenium. (From a photograph.)">Remains of Greek Theatre at Tauromenium. (From a photograph.)</head>
</figure> of scene-painting (<foreign lang="greek">σκηνογραφία</foreign>). Now, this last fact must have stood out clearly in Athenian tradition, which Aristotle had every means of knowing, when he thus coupled it with the other novelty as an invention distinctive of Sophocles. It is usually assumed, even by recent writers, that Aristotle is here irreconcilable with Vitruvius, who ascribes the introduction of scene-painting to Aeschylus. Such an assumption is not, we think, necessary. The words of Vitruvius (vii. <hi rend="italic">praef.</hi> 11) are: “primum Agatharchus Athenis, <title>Aeschylo docente tragoediam</title>, scaenam fecit et de ea commentarium reliquit”; and he then goes on to say how the stimulus given by Agatharchus led Democritus and Anaxagoras to develop principles of perspective. The phrase “while Aeschylus was exhibiting tragedy” merely describes Aeschylus as con <cb /> temporary with the innovation. Sophocles first exhibited in B.C. 468, twelve years before the death of Aeschylus. Aristotle and Vitruvius are reconciled if we suppose that Sophocles introduced <foreign lang="greek">σκηνογραφία</foreign> in the early days of his career; a fact which will also help us to understand why that improvement was peculiarly associated with his name. Even before Agatharchus had made a beginning of artistic <foreign lang="greek">σκηνογραφία</foreign>, some ruder kind of drawing may have been used. Thus in the <title>Persae</title> of Aeschylus (B.C. 472) the palace was probably indicated. In the  <title>Ion</title>of Euripides (cir. B.C. 421), where the scene is laid at Delphi, the Chorus of Athenian maidens point with admiration to the sculptures which adorn the front of the temple.</p>
 <p>With regard to “massive” decoration, as distinguished from a painted background, the objects required by the texts are simple, such as altars, statues of gods or heroes, rocks, and seats. But the texts further prove that certain mechanical appliances were available at need. (1) The <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> was a small movable stage on wheels, which could be rolled forward through the door in the proscenium. There was room on it for three or four persons, and it was low enough to allow of an actor stepping off it with ease. The most frequent use of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> was when the corpse of a person slain within the house was to be shown to the audience—sometimes with the murderer standing beside it. The moment at which the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> was pushed forward is often, though not always, marked in the text by a reference to the opening of the door. But this was not the only case in which the appliance was used: it could also be employed for any tableau in the interior of a house. Thus in 
<pb n="1554" /><cb /> <title>Eumen.</title> the Pythia speaks the prologue in front of the temple, and then the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> is used to show Orestes at the omphalos within. Similarly in <title>Aiax</title>, when Tecmessa opens the tent, this machine serves to display Aiax prostrate amidst the slaughtered cattle. As appears from some passages, the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> could be pushed far enough forward to admit of an actor entering, or making his exit, at the door behind it. It should be noted that the use of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> is not merely an inference from later writers and from hints in Tragedy, but is proved by the two parodies in Aristophanes, where Euripides and Agathon are wheeled out, and are thence once more withdrawn from view ( <bibl n="Stat. Ach. 408" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ach.</title>408</bibl> foll., <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκυκλήθητ . . . ἐκκυκλήσομαι</foreign>: <title>Thesm.</title> 265, <foreign lang="greek">ἐσκυκλησάτω</foreign>). The exact nature of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</foreign> is uncertain, but it was evidently akin to the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign>, differing from it, possibly, only in the mode of propulsion.</p>
 <p>(2) Machinery for showing persons in the air was required by the appearances of the gods, and in some other cases—as when Medea is seen above the palace in the chariot given to her by the Sun ( <bibl n="Eur. Med. 1319" default="NO" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Med.</title>1319</bibl>), or when Trygaeus soars aloft on his beetle ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 80</bibl>). Two different contrivances seem to have been used: both were, of course, concealed by the proscenium. One was an apparatus worked by a wheel (<foreign lang="greek">τροχός</foreign>) and ropes (<foreign lang="greek">αἰῶραι</foreign>), and called <foreign lang="greek">αἰώρημα</foreign>, which was used when the person was to be seen gradually rising into the air, or descending from above. The other device was a sort of platform, projecting from the wings at the back of the proscenium, close to its upper edge. This was the socalled <foreign lang="greek">θεολογεῖον</foreign>, used when the apparition of a god or hero was to be sudden. The <foreign lang="greek">κρεμάθρα</foreign> in which Socrates is suspended ( <title>Nub.</title> 218) is a burlesque of the tragic appliances.</p>
 <p>(3) Akin to the <foreign lang="greek">θεολογεῖον</foreign> must have been the contrivance used when a person is to appear on the roof of a palace (as the watcher in <title>Ag.;</title> Antigoné and the paedagogus in  Eur. <title>Phoen.</title>etc.). A wooden platform, high up behind the proscenium, would have sufficed: according to Pollux, it was called a <foreign lang="greek">διστεγία</foreign>.</p>
 <p>These seem to be the only forms of decoration or mechanism which can certainly be inferred from the texts of the tragedians and of Aristophanes. They are all compatible with a temporary wooden structure and with a comparatively simple phase of scenic art. When, in the course of the fourth century B.C., permanent stone theatres became usual in Greek lands, the general character of scenic decoration was perhaps not at first affected thereby. Behind the proscenium there was now a permanent wall, forming the front of the building assigned to the actors. But the proscenium itself probably continued, for a time, to be temporary—a wooden structure, with painted hangings.</p>
 <p>It may have been at this period that <foreign lang="greek">περίακτοι</foreign> were first introduced. These were triangular wooden prisms, revolving on a pivot (whence the name), with scenery painted on each of their three faces. One <foreign lang="greek">περίακτος</foreign> was placed at the left wing and another at the right. They took the place of modern side-scenes, and also served to indicate changes of scene, according to a regular conventional method. The <foreign lang="greek">περίακτος</foreign> on the spectator's right hand represented the locality in which the action was taking place. The <foreign lang="greek">περίακτος</foreign> on his left hand represented a region outside of that locality. If, for instance, the scene of the play was laid at <cb /> Delphi, the right-hand <foreign lang="greek">περίακτος</foreign> would illustrate that place, while the other might represent the road leading to Athens. The same rule governed entrances and exits: a Delphian would come on from the right, a stranger from the left. If the scene was to be changed from one spot near Delphi to another in the same vicinity, the left-hand <foreign lang="greek">περίακτος</foreign> would be turned so as to present a new face, but the right-hand one would be left unaltered. If the scene was shifted from Delphi to Athens, both <foreign lang="greek">περίακτοι</foreign> would be turned.</p>
 <p>There are only two Greek plays in which it is necessary to assume a change of scene. In the <title>Eumenides</title> the action is transferred from Delphi to Athens; in the <title>Aiax</title>, from the front of the hero's tent to a lonely place on the sea-shore. It is probable that in the first of these examples the change was merely symbolized by substituting the <foreign lang="greek">βρέτας</foreign> of Athené for a statue of Apollo, while the building painted on the background was identified, first with the Delphian temple, and then with the Erechtheum. In the second example, if the background was a landscape, nothing was required but to remove the hangings which represented the tent. The use of <foreign lang="greek">περίακτοι</foreign> in the fifth century B.C. cannot be proved from the dramatic literature. On the other hand, they would have been found peculiarly convenient when the old wooden proscenia, with painted hangings, were replaced by stone proscenia adorned with sculpture. There is no evidence that, in addition to revolving scenery, the Greek theatre had scenes which could be shifted on grooves; though the Roman stage, as Servius tells us, had both (<seg lang="la">ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. G. 3. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>iii. 24</bibl>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Entrances for the Actors</hi>.—Pollux speaks of three doors in the proscenium, the central one being called <foreign lang="greek">θύρα βασίλειος</foreign>, because the chief persons of the play used it. Vitruvius confirms this statement. Ruins of the Hellenistic or Roman Age show sometimes three doors, sometimes five. In the latter case, the two extreme doors may have opened, not on the stage, but on spaces at either side of it (<foreign lang="greek">παρασκήνια</foreign>), used by actors waiting for their turns, or by officials. In the theatre at Megalopolis (fourth century B.C.) there were three entrances to the stage. Only one entrance is traceable in the remains at Epidaurus, Zea, and Oropus respectively. It is on a level with the orchestra; hence those who disbelieve in a raised stage regard it as the entrance for the actors. But it may have passed beneath a raised stage, serving to give the employés of the theatre a direct access to the orchestra. How many doors there may have been in the painted hangings of the old wooden proscenia, we cannot tell. The fifth-century texts show that, besides the door or doors in the proscenium, there were also entrances for the actors from the sides, right and left.</p>
 <p>Pollux says that when ghosts appeared on the scene they came up either by <foreign lang="greek">ἀναπιέσματα</foreign> (our “trap-doors”) or by the <foreign lang="greek">χαρώνιοι κλίμακες</foreign>. It has generally been supposed that these <foreign lang="greek">κλίμακες</foreign> led from the orchestra to the stage. This is the case at Megalopolis. Another theory is that they connected the stage with a passage beneath it, invisible to the spectators.</p>
 <p>No curtain was used in the Greek theatre. When a play opened with a group in position (such as the suppliants in the <title>Oed. Tyr.</title>), the actors must have simply walked on to the scene and assumed that position. When one play followed another 
<pb n="1555" /><cb />
 and the background had to be changed, that change took place before the eyes of the spectators. In such matters we cannot judge the feelings of Athenians assembled at the Dionysia by the requirements of modern playgoers.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Administration of the Theatre</hi>.—A Greek theatre was the property of the State, and the performances in it were acts of public worship under State control. At Athens, in the fifth and and fourth centuries B.C., drama accompanied two Dionysiac festivals—the Lenaea, in January, and the Great Dionysia, in March. At each festival both Tragedy and Comedy were produced; but the Lenaea were peculiarly associated with Comedy, and the Great Dionysia with Tragedy. The cost of the performances at each festival was defrayed from three sources: (1) The theatre was let by the State to a lessee, who received the money paid for admission, and in return undertook certain charges. One of these, as appears from an extant document (<title>C. I. A.</title> ii. 573), was the maintenance of the building in good repair. Hence the classical name for the lessee, <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιτέκτων</foreign>. He was also bound to provide a certain number of free seats (as for the persons entitled to <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>); but for these he was probably reimbursed by the treasury. The provision of scenery and of costume for the actors (excepting the <hi rend="italic">choreutae</hi>) appears also to have devolved upon the lessee. He was certainly charged with the custody of the scenery and of all the theatrical dresses and properties. He also paid the cashiers, the persons who showed spectators to their places, and all other employés of the theatre.</p>
 <p>(2) The second source of contribution was the <hi rend="italic">choregia.</hi> For each festival the Archon Eponymus appointed as many <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi> as there were competing poets; at the Great Dionysia the number was usually three for Tragedy and three for Comedy. The <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi> were chosen from men nominated by the ten Attic tribes in rotation. The duty of the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> was to furnish one Chorus of fifteen persons for Tragedy, or of twenty-four for Comedy. He provided a suitable place for their training (<foreign lang="greek">χορηγεῖον</foreign>), and maintained them till the festival was over. If the poet did not train them himself, the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> had to find a <foreign lang="greek">χοροδιδάσκαλος</foreign>. He had also to supply the flute-player (<foreign lang="greek">αὐλητής</foreign>) who preceded the Chorus on entering or quitting the orchestra and played the occasional music. He purchased the costumes, masks, etc., for the Chorus. But his task was not finished when the Chorus was trained and equipped. He had also to supply any mute persons (<foreign lang="greek">κωφὰ πρόσωπα</foreign>) that might be required for the piece.</p>
 <p>(3) The third contributor was the State. When a poet had applied to the archon for a Chorus and his application had been granted, the archon next assigned to him three actors, who were paid by the State. It did not rest with the poet to decide which of these three should be <foreign lang="greek">πρωταγωνιστής</foreign>, etc.: he received them from the State already classified according to merit, as actors of first, second, and third parts. This classification rested ultimately on special <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες</foreign> in which actors were directly tried against each other, and which were distinct from the performances at the festivals. If a poet ever required a fourth actor (probably a very rare case), he could only go to the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi>, who might make an “extra grant” (<foreign lang="greek">παραχορήγημα</foreign>). The State also paid the marshals (<foreign lang="greek">ῥαβδοῦχοι</foreign>) who kept order in the theatre, and who were stationed in the orchestra. Lastly, <cb /> a certain <seg lang="la">honorarium</seg>, distinct from the festivalprizes, was paid by the Treasury to each of the competing poets, according to the order in which they were placed by the judges.</p>
 <p>The character of the dramatic contests as solemnities conducted by the State was strongly marked in the forms of procedure. A few days before the Great Dionysia, the ceremony called the <foreign lang="greek">προάγων</foreign> (“prelude”) was held in the old Odeion near the Enneacrunos. The competing poets, with their respective <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi>, were then formally presented to the public; the actors and choruses were also present, in festal, but not in scenic, attire; and the titles of the plays to be produced at the approaching festival were officially announced. When the first day of the Great Dionysia arrived, the dramatic contests were preceded by the transaction of some public business in the theatre. It was then that crowns of honour were awarded for public services, and that the orphans of Athenians slain in war were presented to the citizens. In due course a public herald summoned the first on the list of competing poets. He entered the orchestra, attended by the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> and Chorus, and poured a libation at the <hi rend="italic">thymelé</hi> to Dionysus. His procession then withdrew; the orchestra was once more empty, and the play began. One prize for Tragedy and one for Comedy were awarded by ten judges, taken by lot from a large number of persons whom the Senate (with the <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi>) had chosen from the tribes. At the close of the contests, five judges (taken from the ten by a second ballot) announced the awards. The successful poets were then crowned, before the audience, by the archon. Shortly after the festival, a public meeting, for business connected with it, was held in the theatre.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Audience</hi>.—According to a recent estimate, the Dionysiac Theatre was once capable of seating about 27,500 persons. It must be remembered that all the upper tiers have been destroyed, and that the ancient capacity was enormously greater than it would appear from the seats which still exist. Plato was using round numbers when he spoke of “more than 30,000 Greeks” as present in the Dionysiac Theatre at the tragic contests ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 175" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>175</bibl>E), but it is quite conceivable that the number was sometimes nearer to 30,000 than to 20,000. The vast theatre at Megalopolis could hold, according to one modern computation, no fewer than 44,000 persons. Such numbers become intelligible when we consider that the Greek drama was essentially a popular festival, in which the entire civic body was invited to take part. Even young boys were present both at Comedy and at Tragedy. Women were certainly present at Tragedy; and a fragment of Alexis shows that, in the fourth century B.C., they were admitted to the performances of Comedy also. This, however, was the Middle Comedy—very different, in some respects, from the Old Comedy of Aristophanes. It would be a natural inference from the seclusion in which Athenian women lived that they were not admitted to the Old Comedy. But against this <seg lang="la">a priori</seg> argument may be set another—viz., that, at the Dionysia, Tragedy and Comedy were merely different sides of one <foreign lang="greek">ἀγών</foreign>: those who could participate in one were entitled to share in the other. A line drawn on grounds of decorum would dissever elements which, in the Dionysiac idea, were inseparable. There is no conclusive literary evidence. At Athens <figure id="fig.01556">
<head orig="Theatre at Segesta. (Restoration.)">Theatre at Segesta. (Restoration.)</head>
</figure> the <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign> were admitted to the theatre. Foreigners were also admitted, whether officials or private persons. 
<pb n="1556" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the earliest days of Athenian drama, admission was doubtless free of charge; payment may have been introduced after the expulsion of the Pisistratidae, when the city began to find the cost too heavy. In the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. the price of admission for one day was two obols, or not quite $0.08. Pericles introduced the system by which the State paid two obols to each citizen for each day of the Dionysiac festivals, in order that he might attend the theatre. This <foreign lang="greek">θεωρικόν</foreign> was partly defrayed from the tribute of the allies, and probably began about B.C. 454. It was distributed by the demarchs in the several demes; and, though it was first devised in the interests of the poor, the only condition of obtaining it seems to have been enrollment on the register of the deme. The number of persons receiving the <foreign lang="greek">θεωρικόν</foreign> in B.C. 431 has been computed at 18,000. All seats were of the same class, except those reserved for persons who had the right of <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>, and who paid nothing. (Cf. Dem. <title>De Cor.</title> 28.) The places of payment were probably in the <foreign lang="greek">πάροδοι</foreign> leading to the orchestra. Specimens of ordinary Greek theatre-tickets are extant. These are small leaden coins, bearing on one side some emblem of the theatre, such as a Dionysus with a tripod, or an actor's mask; and on the obverse, the name of an Attic tribe, or a numeral. Many examples have been published by <figure id="fig.01556.2">
<head orig="Theatre-tickets.">Theatre-tickets.</head>
</figure> Benndorf (<title>Zeitschr. f. d. österr. Gymn.</title> xxvi.). <cb /> Another kind of theatre-ticket also occurs. This is a small round mark of bone or ivory, bearing on one side some artistic device (such as the head of a deity), and on the other a number (never higher than 15), in both Greek and Roman figures. These were tickets, of the Imperial Age, for persons who had <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>. The numbers probably indicate divisions of the house. How far such division was carried is uncertain. The members of the Senate sat together in a definite part of the Dionysiac Theatre (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ βουλευτικόν</foreign>). For youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, a space was similarly reserved (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἐφηβικόν</foreign>).</p>
 <p>The performances began in the morning, and lasted till evening; but it is attested by the comic poet Pherecrates—who gained his first prize in B.C. 438—that the spectators had usually taken the morning meal (<foreign lang="greek">ἄριστον</foreign>) before they came (Athen. x. 464 e). In the next century, however, we hear of performances beginning at daybreak ( <title>in Ctes.</title> 76). The older Athenian custom was for all the spectators to wear wreaths (as at a sacrifice); but this had perhaps gone out before B.C. 350. As the whole day was spent in the theatre, the visitors brought light refreshments (<foreign lang="greek">τραγήματα</foreign>) with them. <title>Choregi</title> sometimes courted popularity by a distribution of cakes and wine: and Aristophanes has pilloried those rival poets who employed slaves to throw nuts about the house. An Athenian audience was closely attentive—detecting the slightest fault of speech—and highly demonstrative. Loud clapping of hands and shouts of applause expressed their delight; disapproval found vent in stamping with the feet, hissing, and hooting (<foreign lang="greek">κλώζειν</foreign>). Never, probably, has the ordeal for an actor been more severe 
<pb n="1557" /><cb /> than it was at Athens. Persons of note who entered the house were recognized with frank favour, or the reverse. Indeed, the whole demeanour of Athenians at the Dionysia appears to have been marked by a certain sense of domestic ease, as if all the holiday-makers were members of one family.</p>
 <p>From the latter part of the fourth century B.C. onwards, it became usual to produce drama, not merely at the Dionysia, but on any occasion of special rejoicing; a result partly due to the personal taste of Alexander the Great for theatrical shows of every kind. Hence the theatres gradually lost that sacred character which had been theirs so long as they were set apart for the worship of Dionysus. A further consequence was that they began to be used for various entertainments which had nothing to do with drama, such as the exhibitions of conjurers or acrobats, and, in the Roman age, gladiatorial shows, or combats with <figure id="fig.01557">
<head orig="Remains of Greek Theatre at Syracuse.">Remains of Greek Theatre at Syracuse.</head>
</figure> wild beasts. Even in the fifth century B.C., indeed, cock-fighting had been held on one day of the year in the Dionysiac Theatre.</p>
 <p>Mention has been made of the meetings for public business held in the Dionysiac Theatre just before and after the Great Dionysia. In the latter part of the fifth century we hear of the citizens convening the ecclesia in the theatre at Munychia, and in the Dionysiac Theatre itself, when the Pnyx was not available ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8. 93" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii. 93</bibl> foll.). By B.C. 250 it had become usual to hold ordinary meetings of the ecclesia in the Dionysiac Theatre; though the elections of magistrates (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαιρεσίαι</foreign>) continued to be held on the Pnyx. From the fifth century B.C. the theatre had been the regular place for the bestowal of public honours, such as crowns. In later times a theatre was often also the scene of an exemplary punishment ( <bibl n="Nep. Timol. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Timol.</title>34</bibl>). As statues of Themistocles and Miltiades stood in the <cb /> Dionysiac Theatre, so, at every period of Greek antiquity, such places were adorned with monuments of statesmen and soldiers, no less than of poets, musicians, and actors. This was in accord with the true idea of the Greek theatre, which was not merely the home of an art, but also a centre of civic reunion.
 </p>
 <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rome</hi> possessed no theatre of stone till B.C. 55. Just a century earlier such an edifice had been in progress, when P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica procured a decree of the Senate for its destruction (Livy, <title>Epit.</title>48). The spirit of the Roman veto on permanent theatres was one which refused to regard the drama except as a passing frivolity. Wooden theatres were erected, and pulled down when the occasion was over. But before the middle of the first century B.C. these temporary structures had already begun to show a high elaboration. The building put up by the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus in B.C. 58 contained 80,000 seats; the proscenium was adorned with pillars of marble and statues of bronze; and the whole work seems to have possessed every element of grandeur except permanence. The old interdict had already lost its meaning, and three years later Pompeius was allowed to erect, near the Campus Martius, the first theatre of stone. The model is said to have been the theatre of Mitylené, and the number of seats 40,000. The theatre of Marcellus, built by Augustus, and named after his nephew, was also of stone, and could hold 20,500 persons. A third such building, with a capacity of 11,510, was completed in B.C. 13 by L. Cornelius Balbus. These are the <seg lang="la">trina theatra</seg> of Suetonius ( <bibl n="Cic. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>). Meanwhile many provincial towns in Italy and elsewhere had long possessed stone theatres, built or altered under Roman influence.</p>
 <p>The Roman type of theatre is simply the Greek type modified in certain particulars. The ground 
<pb n="1558" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.01558">
<head orig="Roman Theatre, after Vitruvius.">Roman Theatre, after Vitruvius.</head>
</figure>
 plan is thus described by Vitruvius: In a circle of the same diameter which the orchestra is to have, inscribe three equilateral triangles. Take one side of any triangle, and let this be the back wall of the stage, <seg lang="la">scaenae frons</seg> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a b</hi>). A diameter of the circle, drawn parallel with <hi rend="SmallCaps">a b</hi>, will represent the line dividing the stage from the orchestra (<hi rend="SmallCaps">c d</hi>). The seats for the spectators are arranged round the orchestra in semicircles concentric with it. The five points above the line <hi rend="SmallCaps">c d</hi>, where the angles touch the circumference, are the points from which five flights of steps lead up to the seats, dividing them into six <seg lang="la">cunei.</seg> Above the first zone, or semicircular passage (<seg lang="la">praecinctio</seg>), the seats are divided into twelve <seg lang="la">cunei</seg> by eleven stairways. Just above the points <hi rend="SmallCaps">c</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">d</hi>, access is given to the orchestra by two vaulted passages which pass under the upper rows of seats (<hi rend="SmallCaps">e, f</hi>). The platform of the stage is prolonged right and left, so that its total length (<hi rend="SmallCaps">g h</hi>) is equal to twice the diameter of the orchestra. In the back wall of the stage there are to be three doors, the positions of which are marked by the points <hi rend="SmallCaps">i, k, l</hi>. Thus the distinctive features of the Roman theatre are these two: (1) The orchestra is not, as in the Greek theatre, a circle (or the greater part of it), but only a semicircle. The diameter of the orchestra is now the front line of a raised stage. Consequently the auditorium, also, forms only a half-circle. The primary cause of this change was that the old Dionysiac Chorus had disappeared; the orchestra, therefore, had no longer a dramatic use.</p>
 <p>(2) In the Greek theatre the auditorium and the scene-buildings were not architecturally linked. The <foreign lang="greek">πάροδοι</foreign> were open passages between them. <cb /> In the Roman theatre the sidewalls of the scene-building were carried forward till they met the side-walls of the auditorium. By this organic union of the two main parts the whole theatre was made a single compact building.</p>
 <p>These two main differences explain the other points in which the Roman theatre varied from its Greek original. Thus: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Having closed the openings afforded by the <foreign lang="greek">πάροδοι</foreign>, the Romans needed some other access to their semicircular orchestra. Here the arch served them. By cutting off a few seats in the lower rows at the angles right and left of the stage, they obtained height enough for vaulted passages, which ran under the auditorium into the orchestra. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) The solid unity of the Roman theatres lent itself to the Roman taste for decoration of a monumental character. The permanent Greek proscenia, though usually adorned with columns, had been simple. But the richest embellishments of architecture and sculpture were lavished on the Roman proscenia, in which two or more stories were usually distinguished by carefully harmonized modes of treatment. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) A similar magnificence was shown in the external façades. Greek theatres had usually been erected <figure id="fig.01558.2">
<head orig="Small Theatre at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Small Theatre at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="1559" /><cb />
 on natural slopes. A Roman theatre was more often built on level ground. The auditorium rested on massive substructions, of which the walls were connected by arches. From the open spaces thus afforded, numerous wide staircases ascended, beneath the auditorium, to the several rows of seats. Corridors, opening on these staircases, ran along the inner side of the semicircular wall which enclosed the auditorium. The exterior of this wall was adorned with columns, having arcades between them, and rising in three or more successive stories, divided by architrave and cornice. Thus while the architectural significance of a Greek theatre depended wholly on the interior, a Roman theatre had also the external aspect of a stately public building.</p>
 <p>With regard to the internal arrangements of the Roman theatre, the following points claim notice. (1) The raised stage (<seg lang="la">pulpitum</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">λογεῖον</foreign>) is in some instances on a level with the lowest row of seats behind the orchestra. Sometimes, again, the stage is rather higher, but the (originally) lowest row of seats has been abolished, leaving the stage still level with those seats which are actually lowest. In a third class of examples, the stage is higher than the lowest row of seats—as it is at Orange in France. The Roman stage in the Dionysiac Theatre at Athens is of this class.</p>
 <p>(2) Awnings were spread over the theatre to protect the spectators from sun or rain. These were usually called <seg lang="la">vela:</seg> the term <seg lang="la">velaria</seg> occurs only in <bibl n="Juv.  4. 122." default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iv. 122.</bibl>Pliny , who describes them as <seg lang="la">carbasina vela</seg> (of linen), says that they were introduced by Q. Catulus, in B.C. 78 (xix. 23). They were supported by masts (<seg lang="la">mali</seg>), fixed to the outer walls of the theatre by massive rings or sockets, which can still be seen at Orange and Pompeii. Between the masts were cross-beams (<seg lang="la">trabes</seg>), for greater convenience in unfurling the <seg lang="la">vela.</seg> Such awnings were of various colours, as yellow, red, dark-blue ( <bibl n="Lucr.  4. 75" default="NO" valid="yes">Lucr.iv. 75</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>(3) Until the play began, the stage was concealed by a curtain, which was then lowered. The place into which it sank, just inside of the front line of the stage, can be seen in the larger theatre at Pompeii. At the end of the piece the curtain was drawn up. Hence, where we say “the curtain rises,” the Romans said <seg lang="la">aulaeum mittitur</seg> or <seg lang="la">subducitur;</seg> “the curtain is up,” <seg lang="la">aulaeum premitur;</seg> “the curtain falls,” <seg lang="la">aulaeum tollitur.</seg> The word <seg lang="la">siparium</seg> (from the base of <foreign lang="greek">σίφαρος</foreign>, topsail, <seg lang="la">supparum</seg>) meant a folding screen. Apuleius (A.D. 150) describes a kind of ballet as beginning “when the curtain had been lowered, and the screens folded up” (<seg lang="la">sipariis complicitis</seg> [ <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>10</bibl>, p. 232]). If these screens were within the curtain, the reason for using them along with it may have been to heighten the effect of a tablean by disclosing it gradually. In the later parts of the piece, they may have served to conceal scene-shifting. Another use is also possible. Theatres of the Macedonian and Roman period sometimes had two stages, the higher being used by the regular actors, the lower by mimes or dancers; and the latter may have been concealed by the <seg lang="la">siparium</seg>, as the other by the <seg lang="la">aulaeum.</seg> The word <seg lang="la">siparium</seg> is regularly associated with comedy or mimes (Seneca, <title>De Tranq. An.</title> 11. 8; <bibl n="Juv.  8. 186" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.viii. 186</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(4) Assignment of seats. The orchestra was reserved for senators. As a special mark of distinction, foreigners (usually ambassadors) were occasionally admitted to it (see  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 54" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiii. 54</bibl>). The rest of the auditorium was <cb /> called <seg lang="la">cavea.</seg> The Lex Roscia, proposed by the tribune L. Roscius Otho in B.C. 67, provided that the fourteen rows of seats in the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> nearest to the orchestra should be reserved for the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>— excluding any who should have become bankrupt <figure id="fig.01559">
<head orig="Restoration of the Scena Stabilis at Herculaneum. (Overbeck.)">Restoration of the Scena Stabilis at Herculaneum. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.  44" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>ii. 44</bibl>). Owing to the large number of <seg lang="la">equites</seg> who had been ruined by the Civil Wars, Augustus decreed that the privilege given by the Lex Roscia should be enjoyed by any <seg lang="la">eques</seg> who 
<pb n="1560" /><cb />
 had at any time possessed, or whose father had possessed, the amount of the <seg lang="la">equester census</seg>—viz., 400,000 sesterces ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>40</bibl>). This is probably the Lex Iulia Theatralis meant by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 8</bibl>). Augustus further assigned special portions of the <seg lang="la">cavea</seg> to (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) women; <seg lang="la">(b) praetextati</seg> —i. e. boys who had not yet assumed the toga virilis, and their paedagogi; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) soldiers; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) married men belonging to the plebs. This was a premium on marriage, like others provided in the Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea. In some provincial theatres the town-councillors (<seg lang="la">decuriones</seg>) had seats of honour (<seg lang="la">bisellia</seg>) on the rows next the orchestra. Corresponding to the “royal box” in a European theatre was the <seg lang="la">tribunal</seg>, immediately over the stage on the spectator's left. This was occupied by the emperor, or by the president of the performance. A corresponding <seg lang="la">tribunal</seg> on the left side was assigned to the Vestals, among whom the empress sat. Thus, from the Augustan Age onwards, the contrast between a Greek and a Roman theatre was extended to the arrangements for the audience. Instead of the simple Greek distinction between those who had or had not <foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>, the Roman auditorium exhibited an elaborate classification by sex, age, profession, and rank.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">The Odeum</hi>.—The term <foreign lang="greek">ᾠδεῖον</foreign>, denoting a species of theatre appropriated to musical performances, occurs first in a fragment of the comic poet Cratinus (cir. B.C. 450), with reference to the Odeum of Pericles, but it may have been in use from a much earlier time. The oldest recorded example is the <foreign lang="greek">Σκιάς</foreign> at Sparta, which is said to have been round, and to have been named from the resemblance of its top to a sunshade (<foreign lang="greek">σκιάς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σκιάδειον</foreign>: <title>Etym. Magn.</title>). Athens possessed three <foreign lang="greek">ᾤδεια</foreign>: (1) that near the fountain Enneacrunus by the Ilissus, conjecturally referred to Pisistratus or Solon;</p>
 <p>(2) the Odeum of Pericles, a little to the northeast of the Dionysiac Theatre;</p>
 <p>(3) the Odeum built by Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, on the south slope of the Acropolis. This was built later than A.D. 161. Considerable remains of it still exist. The Odeum may best be regarded as the supplement to the Greek theatre.</p>

It was reputed the oldest city of the world. It stood in about the centre of the Thebaïd, on both banks of the Nile, above Coptos, and in the Nomos Coptites. It is said to have been founded under the first dynasty by Menes; but this is unsupported by any evidence. Others ascribed its foundation to Osiris, <cb /> who named it after his mother, and others to Busiris. It appears to have been at the height of its splendour, as the capital of Egypt, and as a chief seat of worship of Ammon, about B.C. 1330 under the Nineteenth Dynasty. The fame of its grandeur had reached the Greeks as early as the time of Homer, who describes it, with poetical exaggeration, as having a hundred gates, from each of which it could send out 200 war chariots fully armed ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 381" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ix. 381</bibl>). Homer's epithet of “HundredGated” (<foreign lang="greek">ἑκατόμπυλοι</foreign>) is repeatedly applied to the city by later writers. Its real extent was calculated by the Greek writers at 140 stadia (fourteen geographical miles) in circuit; and in Strabo's time, when the long transference of the seat of power to Lower Egypt had caused it to decline greatly, it still had a circuit of eighty stadia ( <bibl n="Diod.  1. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.i. 50</bibl>; xv. 45; Strabo, pp. 805, 815). That these computations are not exaggerated is proved by the existing ruins, which extend from side to side of the valley of the Nile, here about six miles wide; while the rocks which bound the valley are perforated with tombs. These ruins, which are perhaps the most magnificent in the world, enclose within their site the four modern villages of Karnak, Luxor (El Uksur), Medînet Habou, and Kurna—the two former on the eastern and the two latter on the western side of the river. They consist of temples, colossi, sphinxes, and obelisks, and, on the western side, of tombs, many of which are cut in the rock and adorned with paintings, which are still as fresh as if just finished. These ruins are remarkable alike for their great antiquity and for the purity of their style. It is most probable that the great buildings were all erected before the Persian invasion, when Thebes was taken by Cambyses, who secured treasure to the amount of some $10,000,000, and burned the wooden habitations, after which time it never regained the rank of a capital city; and thus its architectural monuments escaped that Greek influence which is so marked in the edifices of Lower Egypt. Among its chief buildings, the ancient writers mention the Memnonium, with the two colossi in front of it, the temple of Ammon, in which one of the three chief colleges of priests was established, and the tombs of the kings. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmemnon">Memnon</ref>.</p>
 <p>To describe the ruins in detail, and to discuss their identification, would far exceed the possible limits of this article. Suffice it to mention among the monuments on the western (Libyan) side the three temples of Seti I., Rameses II., and Rameses III. Near the second is the fallen colossus of Rameses II., the largest statue in Egypt. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossrameses">Rameses</ref>.) Beyond is the terraced temple of Queen Hatasu of the Eighteenth Dynasty, near which a remarkable series of mummies and papyri were found by Brugsch in 1881. At Medînet Habou is a great temple of Rameses III., with interesting sculptures describing his victories over the Philistines, and also a calendar. Northwest of this are the cemeteries of the sacred apes and the Valley of the Tombs of the Queens (seventeen sepulchres). On the eastern bank at Luxor is the beautiful temple of Amenoph III., with an obelisk whose fellow now stands in the Place de la Concorde at Paris. At Karnak is a splendid group of temples built under the Twelfth Dynasty. The finest portion of this maze of architectural magnificence is the Great Hall, 170 by 329 feet, with twelve imposing columns 62 feet in height and 12 feet in diameter,

 and 122 minor columns, and two obelisks, of which one is the tallest in Egypt, being 108 feet in height. On the walls are fine sculptures depicting the battles of Seti I. and Rameses II. against the Hittites, Arabs, Syrians, and Armenians. In one of the porticos is recorded the expedition of Shishak I. against Jerusalem in B.C. 971.</p>
 <p>In classical times Thebes was a great showplace, and was visited by both Greek and Roman tourists, among the latter being the emperor Hadrian.

 <p> (1) <foreign lang="greek">Θῆβαι</foreign>, in poetry <hi rend="bold">Thebé</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Θήβη</foreign>, Dor. <foreign lang="greek">Θήβα</foreign>). Now Thion; the chief city in Boeotia. It was situated in a plain southeast of Lake Helicé and northeast of Plataeae. Its acropolis, which was an oval eminence of no great height, was called Cadmea (<foreign lang="greek">Καδμεία</foreign>), because it was said to have been founded by Cadmus, the leader of a Phoenician colony. On each side of this acropolis is a small valley, running up from the Theban plain into the low ridge of hills by which it is separated from that of Plataeae. Of these valleys, the one to the west is watered by the Dircé, and the one to the east by the Ismenus, both of which, however, are insignificant little streams, though so celebrated in ancient story. The greater part of the city stood in these valleys, and was built some time after the acropolis. It is said that the fortifications of the city were constructed by Amphion and his brother Zethus; and that, when Amphion played his lyre, the stones moved of their own accord and formed the wall. The territory of Thebes was called <ref type="cross" target="crossthebais">Thebāïs</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Θηβαΐς</foreign>), and extended eastward as far as the Euboean Sea. No city is more celebrated in the mythical ages of Greece than Thebes. It was here that the use of letters was first introduced from Phoenicia into western Europe. It was the reputed birthplace of the two great divinities, Dionysus and Heracles. It was also the native city of the great seer Tiresias, as well as of the great musician Amphion. It was the scene of the tragic fate of Oedipus, and of one of the most celebrated wars in the mythical annals of Greece. Polynices, who had been expelled from Thebes by his brother Eteocles, induced six other heroes to espouse his cause, and marched against the city; but they were all defeated and slain by <cb /> the Thebans, with the exception of Adrastus, Polynices, and Eteocles falling by each other's hands. This is usually called the war of the Seven against Thebes. A few years afterwards the Epigoni, or descendants of the seven heroes, marched against Thebes to avenge their fathers' death; they took the city and razed it to the ground. Thebes is not mentioned by Homer in the catalogue of the Greek cities which fought against Troy, as it was probably supposed not yet to have recovered from its devastation by the Epigoni. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossseven-against-thebes">Seven against Thebes</ref>.) It appears, however, at the earliest historical period as a large and flourishing city; and it is represented as possessing seven gates (<foreign lang="greek">ἑπτάπυλος</foreign>), the number assigned to it in the ancient legends. Its government, after the abolition of monarchy, was an aristocracy, or rather an oligarchy, which continued to be the prevailing form of government for a long time, although occasionally exchanged for that of a democracy. Towards the end of the Peloponnesian War, however, the oligarchy finally disappears; and Thebes appears under a democratical form of government from this time, till it became with the rest of Greece subject to the Romans.</p>
 <p>The Thebans were from an early period inveterate enemies of their neighbours, the Athenians. Their hatred of the latter people was probably one <figure id="fig.01561.2">
<head orig="Coin of the Boeotian Thebes.">Coin of the Boeotian Thebes.</head>
</figure> of the reasons which induced them to desert the cause of Grecian liberty in the great struggle against the Persian power. In the Peloponnesian War the Thebans naturally espoused the Spartan side, and contributed not a little to the downfall of Athens. But, in common with the other Greek States, they soon became disgnsted with the Spartan supremacy, and joined the confederacy formed against Sparta in B.C. 394. The peace of Antalcidas in 387 put an end to hostilities in Greece; but the treacherous seizure of the Cadmea by the Lacedaemonian general Phoebidas in 382, and its recovery by the Theban exiles in 379, led to a war between Thebes and Sparta, in which the former not only recovered its independence, but forever destroyed the Lacedaemonian supremacy. This was the most glorious period in the Theban annals; and the decisive defeat of the Spartans at the battle of Leuctra in 371 made Thebes the first power in Greece. Her greatness, however, was mainly due to the preëminent abilities of her citizens, Epaminondas and Pelopidas; and with the 
<pb n="1562" /><cb />
 death of the former at the battle of Mantinea in 362, she lost the supremacy which she had so recently gained. Soon afterwards Philip of Macedon began to exercise a paramount influence over the greater part of Greece. The Thebans were induced, by the eloquence of Demosthenes, to forget their old animosities against the Athenians, and to join the latter in protecting the liberties of Greece; but their united forces were defeated by Philip, at the battle of Chaeronea, in 338. Soon after the death of Philip and the accession of Alexander, the Thebans made a last attempt to recover their liberty, but were cruelly punished by the young king. The city was taken by Alexander in 336, and was entirely destroyed, with the exception of the temples, and the house of the poet Pindar; 6000 inhabitants were slain, and 30,000 sold as slaves. In 316 the city was rebuilt by Cassander, with the assistance of the Athenians. In 290 it was taken by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and again suffered greatly. Dicaearchus, who flourished about this time, has left us an interesting account of the city. He describes it as about seventy stadia (nearly nine miles) in circumference, in form nearly circular, and in appearance somewhat gloomy. He says that it is plentifully provided with water, and contains better gardens than any other city in Greece; that it is most agreeable in summer, on account of its plentiful supply of cool and fresh water, and its large gardens; but that in winter it is very unpleasant, being destitute of fuel, exposed to floods and cold winds, and frequently visited by heavy falls of snow. He further represents the people as proud and insolent, and always ready to settle disputes by fighting, rather than by the ordinary course of justice. It is supposed that the population of the city at this time may have been between 50,000 and 60,000 souls. See <bibl default="NO">Sankey, <title>Spartan and Theban Supremacies</title> (1877)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>After the Macedonian period Thebes rapidly declined in importance; and it received its last blow from Sulla , who gave half of its territory to the Delphians. Strabo describes it as only a village in his time; and Pausanias, who visited it in the second century of the Christian era, says that the Cadmea alone was then inhabited. The modern town is also confined to this spot, and the surrounding country is covered with a confused heap of ruins. See E. Fabricius, <bibl default="NO"><title>Theben</title> (Heidelberg, 1891)</bibl>; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossepaminondas">Epaminondas</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspelopidas">Pelopidas</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεμιστοκλῆς</foreign>). A celebrated Athenian, the son of Neocles and Abrotonon, a Thracian woman, and born about B.C. 514. In his youth he had an impetuous character, and displayed great intellectual power combined with a 
<pb n="1563" /><cb />
 lofty ambition and a desire for political distinction. He began his career by setting himself in opposition to those who had most power, among whom Aristides was the chief. The fame which Miltiades acquired by his generalship at Marathon made a deep impression on Themistocles; and he said that the trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep. His rival Aristides was ostracized in B.C. 483, to which event Themistocles contributed; and from this time he was the political leader in Athens. In 481 he was Archon Eponymus. It was about this time that he persuaded the Athenians to employ the produce of the silver mines of Laurium in building ships, instead of distributing it among the Athenian citizens. His great object was to draw the Athenians to the sea, as he was convinced that it was only by their fleet that Athens could repel the Persians and obtain the supremacy in Greece. Upon the invasion of Greece by Xerxes, Themistocles was appointed to the command of the Athenian fleet; and to his energy, prudence, foresight, and courage the Greeks mainly owed their salvation from the Persian dominion. <figure id="fig.01563">
<head orig="Themistocles.">Themistocles.</head>
</figure> Upon the approach of Xerxes, the Athenians, on the adviceofThemistocles, deserted their city, and removed their women, children, and infirm persons to Salamis, Aegina, and Troezen; but as soon as the Persians took possession of Athens, the Peloponnesians were anxious to retire to the Corinthian isthmus. Themistocles used all his influence in inducing the Greeks to remain and fight with the Persians at Salamis, and with the greatest difficulty persuaded the Spartan commander Eurybiades to stay at Salamis. But as soon as the fleet of Xerxes made its appearance, the Peloponnesians were again anxious to sail away; and when Themistocles saw that he should be unable to persuade them to remain, he sent a faithful slave to the Persian commanders, informing them that the Greeks intended to make their escape, and that the Persians had now the opportunity of accomplishing a noble enterprise, if they would only cut off the retreat of the Greeks. The Persians believed what they were told, and in the night their fleet occupied the whole of the channel between Salamis and the mainland. The Greeks were thus compelled to fight; and the result was the great and glorious victory, in which the greater part of the fleet of Xerxes was destroyed. This victory, which was due to Themistocles, established his reputation among the Greeks. On his visiting Sparta, he was received with extraordinary honours by the Spartans, who gave Eurybiades the palm of bravery and Themistocles the palm of wisdom and skill ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 124" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 124</bibl>). The <cb /> Athenians now began to restore their ruined city, and Themistocles urged them to rebuild the walls and make them stronger than before. The Spartans sent an embassy to Athens to dissuade them from fortifying their city, for which it is hard to assign any motive except national jealousy. Themistocles, who was at that time <foreign lang="greek">προστάτης τοῦ δήμου</foreign> (i. e. one of the leaders of the popular party), went on an embassy to Sparta, where he amused the Spartans with lies, till the walls were far enough advanced to be in a state of defence. It was upon his advice also that the Athenians fortified the port of Piraeus. The influence of Themistocles does not appear to have survived the expulsion of the Persians from Greece and the fortification of the ports. He was probably justly accused of enriching himself by unfair means, for he had no scruples about the way of accomplishing an end. A story is told that, after the retreat of the fleet of Xerxes, when the Greek fleet was wintering at Pagasae, Themistocles told the Athenians in the public assembly that he had a scheme to propose which was beneficial to the State, but could not be divulged. Aristides was named to receive the secret, and to report upon it. His report was that nothing could be more profitable than the scheme of Themistocles, but nothing more unjust: the Athenians were guided by the report of Aristides. It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the statement in  <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Ath. Pol.</title>25</bibl>, that Themistocles intrigued for the overthow of the Areopagus, with the date of his exile from Athens. The attack upon the Areopagus was in 463; but in 471, in consequence of the political strife between Themistocles and Aristides, the former was ostracized from Athens, and retired to Argos.</p>
 <p>After the discovery of the treasonable correspondence of Pausanias with the Persian king, the Lacedaemonians sent to Athens to accuse Themistocles of being privy to the design of Pausanias. Thereupon the Athenians sent off persons with the Lacedaemonians with instructions to arrest Themistocles (466). Themistocles, hearing of what was designed against him, first fled from Argos to Corcyra, and then to Epirus, where he took refuge in the house of Admetus, king of the Molossi, who happened to be from home. Admetus was no friend to Themistocles, but his wife told the fugitive that he would be protected if he would take their child in his arms and sit on the hearth. The king soon came in, and, respecting his suppliant attitude, raised him up, and refused to surrender him to the Lacedaemonian and Athenian agents. Themistocles finally reached the coast of Asia in safety. Xerxes was now dead (465), and Artaxerxes was on the throne (Thucyd. i. 235;  <bibl n="Plut. Them. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Them.</title>23</bibl>;  <bibl n="Nep. Them. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Nep. <title>Them.</title>4</bibl>). Themistocles went up to visit the king at his royal residence; and on his arrival he sent the king a letter, in which he promised to do the king a good service, and prayed that he might be allowed to wait a year and then to explain personally what brought him there. In a year he made himself master of the Persian language and the Persian usages, and, being presented to the king, he obtained the greatest influence over him, and such as no Greek ever before enjoyed—partly owing to his high reputation and the hopes that he gave to the king of subjecting the Greeks to the Persians. The king gave him a handsome allowance, after the Persian fashion; Magnesia supplied him with bread nominally, but paid him annually 
<pb n="1564" /><cb />
 fifty talents. Lampsacus supplied wine, and Myus the other provisions. Before he could accomplish anything he died; some say that he poisoned himself, finding that he could not perform his promise to the king. A monument was erected to his memory in the Agora of Magnesia, which place was within his government. It is said that his bones were secretly taken to Attica by his relations, and privately interred there.</p>
 <p>Themistocles undoubtedly possessed great talents as a statesman, great political sagacity, a ready wit, and excellent judgment; but he was not an honest man, and, like many other clever men with little morality, he ended his career unhappily and ingloriously. Twenty-one letters attributed to Themistocles are spurious.</p>

<div2 id="crosstheocritus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Theocrĭtus">Theocritus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεόκριτος</foreign>). The most famous of the Greek bucolic poets was a native of Syracuse, the son of Praxagoras and Philinna. He visited Alexandria towards the end of the reign of Ptolemy Soter, where he received the instruction of Philetas and Asclepiades, and began to distinguish himself as a poet. Other accounts make him a native of Cos, which would bring him more directly into connection with Philetas (Suidas, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Θεόκριτος</foreign>). His first efforts obtained for him the patronage of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who was associated in the kingdom with his father, Ptolemy Soter, in B.C. 285, and in whose praise, therefore, the poet wrote the fourteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth Idyls. At Alexandria he became acquainted with the poet Aratus, to whom he addressed his sixth Idyl. Theocritus afterwards returned to Syracuse, and lived there under Hiero II. It appears from the sixteenth Idyl that Theocritus was dissatisfied, both with the want of liberality on the part of Hiero in rewarding him for his poems, and with the political state of his native country. It may therefore be supposed that he devoted the latter part of his life almost entirely to the contemplation of those scenes of nature and of country life on his representations of which his fame chiefly rests.</p>
 <p>Theocritus was the creator of bucolic poetry in Greek, and, through imitators, such as Vergil, in Roman literature. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvergilius-maro">Vergilius</ref>.) The bucolic <title>Idyls</title> of Theocritus are of a dramatic and mimetic character. They are <hi rend="italic">pictures</hi> of the ordinary life of the common people of Sicily; whence their name <foreign lang="greek">εἴδη, εἰδύλλια</foreign>. The pastoral poems and romances of later times are a totally different sort of composition from the bucolics of Theocritus, who knows nothing of the affected sentiment which has been ascribed to the imaginary shepherds of a fictitious Arcadia. He merely exhibits simple and faithful pictures of the common life of <cb /> the Sicilian people, in a thoroughly objective, although truly poetical, spirit. Dramatic simplicity and truth are impressed upon the scenes exhibited in his poems, into the colouring of which he has thrown much of the natural comedy which is always seen in the common life of a free people. In his dramatic dialogue he is influenced by the mimes of <ref type="cross" target="crosssophron">Sophron</ref> (q.v.), as may be seen especially in the fifteenth Idyl (<title>Adoniazusae</title>). The poems of Theocritus of this class may be compared with those of Herondas, who belonged, like Theocritus, to the literary school of Philetas of Cos. In genius, however, Theocritus was greatly the superior. The collection which has come down to us under the name of Theocritus consists of thirty poems, called by the general title of <title>Idyls</title>, a fragment of a few lines from a poem entitled <title>Berenicé</title>, and twentytwo epigrams in the Greek Anthology. But these Idyls are not all bucolic, and were not all written by Theocritus. Those of which the genuineness is the most doubtful are the twelfth, twenty-third, twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth; and Idyls xiii., xvi., xvii., xxii., xxiv., and xxvi. are in Epic style, and have more of Epic dialect, especially Idyl xvi. It is likely that these poems on Epic subjects were written early in the poet's life, and, as court poems, had some of the artificial and imitative character of the Alexandrians. In general the dialect of Theocritus is Doric, but two of the Idyls (xxviii. and xxix.) are in the Aeolic.</p>

She was at first Justinian's mistress, and in A.D. 527 became his wife, the emperor having secured the repeal of a law which forbade the marriage of a member of the Senate with an actress. From the time of her wedding, however, she lived a life of exemplary purity, and was to her husband a wise and trusty counsellor, and one whose courage saved the throne at the time of the riots that took place in 532.

 <p>(2) A king of the Visigoths A.D. 452-466, second son of Theodoric I. He succeeded to the throne by the murder of his brother Thorismond. He ruled over the greater part of Gaul and Spain. He was assassinated in 466 by his brother Euric, who succeeded him on the throne. Theodoric II. was a patron of letters and learned men. The poet Sidonius Apollinaris resided for some time at his court.</p>
 <p>(3) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Great</hi>, king of the Ostrogoths, succeeding his father Theodemir in 475. He was at first an ally of Zeno, the emperor of Constantinople, but was afterwards involved in hostilities with the emperor. In order to get rid of Theodoric, Zeno gave him permission to invade Italy, and expel the usurper Odoacer from the country. Theodoric entered Italy in 489, and, after defeating Odoacer in three great battles, laid siege to Ravenna, in which Odoacer took refuge. After a siege of three years Odoacer capitulated on condition that he and Theodoric should rule jointly over Italy; but Odoacer was soon afterwards murdered by his more fortunate rival (493). Theodoric thus became master of Italy, which he ruled for thirty-three years, till his death in 526. His long reign was prosperous and beneficent, and under his sway Italy recovered from the ravages to which it had been exposed for so many years. Theodoric was also a patron of literature: and among his ministers were Cassiodorus and Boëthius, the two last writers who can claim a place in the literature of ancient Rome. But prosperous as had been the reign of Theodoric, his last days were darkened by disputes with the Catholics, and by the condemnation and execution of Boëthius and Symmachus, whom he accused of a conspiracy to overthrow the Gothic dominion in Italy. His death is said to have been hastened by remorse. It his related that one evening, when a large fish was served on the table, he fancied that he beheld the head of Symmachus, and was so terrified that he took to his bed, and died three days afterwards. Theodoric was buried at Ravenna, and a monument was erected to his memory by his daughter Amalasuntha. His ashes were deposited in a porphyry vase, which is still to be seen at Ravenna.

<head orig="Theodosius">Theodosius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεοδόσιος</foreign>). (1) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Great</hi>, Roman emperor of the East, A.D. 378-395. He was the son of the general Theodosius who restored Britain to the Empire, and was beheaded at Carthage in the reign of Valens (A.D. 376). The future emperor was born in Spain about A.D. 346. He received a good education; and he learned the art of war under his own father, whom he accompanied in his British campaigns. During his father's lifetime he was raised to the rank of Duke (<seg lang="la">dux</seg>) of Moesia, where he defeated the Sarmatians (374) and saved the province. On the death of his father he retired before court intrigues to his native country. He acquired a considerable military reputation in the lifetime of his father; and after the death of Valens, who fell in battle against the Goths, he was proclaimed emperor of the East by Gratian, who felt himself unable to sustain the burden of the Empire. The Roman Empire in the East was then in a critical position; for the Romans were disheartened by the bloody defeat which they had sustained, and the Goths were insolent in their victory. Theodosius, however, showed himself equal to the difficult position in which he was placed; he gained two signal victories over the Goths, and concluded a peace with the barbarians in 382.</p>
 <p>In the following year (383) Maximus assumed the imperial purple in Britain, and invaded Gaul with a powerful army. In the war which followed Gratian was slain; and Theodosius, who did not consider it prudent to enter into a contest with Maximus, acknowledged the latter emperor of the countries of Spain, Gaul, and Britain, but he secured to Valentinian, the brother of Gratian, Italy, Africa, and western Illyricum. But when Maximus expelled Valentinian from Italy in 387, Theodosius espoused the cause of the latter, and marched into the West at the head of a powerful army. After defeating Maximus in Pannonia, Theodosius pursued him across the Alps to Aquileia. Here Maximus was surrendered by his own soldiers to Theodosius and was put to death. Theodosius spent the winter at Milan, and in the following year (389) he entered Rome in triumph, accompanied 
<pb n="1566" /><cb /> by Valentinian and his own son Honorius. Two events in the life of Theodosius about this time may be mentioned as evidence of his uncertain character and his savage temper. In 387 a riot took place at Antioch, in which the statues of the emperor, of his father, and of his wife were thrown down; but these idle demonstrations were quickly suppressed by an armed force. When Theodosius heard of these riots, he degraded Antioch from the rank of a city, stripped it of its possessions and privileges, and reduced it to the condition of a village dependent on Laodicea. But in consequence of the intercession of Antioch and the Senate of Constantinople, he pardoned the city, and all who had taken part in the riot. The other event is an eternal brand of infamy on the name of Theodosius. In 390, while the emperor was at Milan, a serious riot broke out at Thessalonica, in which the imperial officer and several of his troops were murdered. Theodosius resolved to take the most signal vengeance upon the whole city. An army of barbarians was sent to Thessalonica; the people were invited to the games of the Circus; and as soon as the place was full, the soldiers received the signal for massacre. For three hours the spectators were indiscriminately exposed to the fury of the soldiers, and 7000 of them, or, as some accounts say, more than twice that number, paid the penalty of the insurrection. St. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, represented to Theodosius his crime in a letter, and told him that penitence alone could efface his guilt. Accordingly, when the emperor proceeded to perform his devotions in the usual manner in the great church of Milan, the archbishop stopped him at the door, and demanded an acknowledgment of his guilt. The conscience-struck Theodosius humbled himself before the church, which has recorded his penance as one of its greatest victories. He laid aside the insignia of imperial power; in the posture of a suppliant in the church of Milan he asked pardon for his great sin before all the congregation; and, after eight months, the emperor was restored to communion with the Church.</p>
 <p>Theodosius spent three years in Italy, during which he established Valentinian II. on the throne of the West. He returned to Constantinople towards the latter end of 391. Valentinian was slain in 392 by Arbogastes, who raised Eugenius to the Empire of the West. This involved Theodosius in a new war; but it ended in the defeat and death both of Eugenius and Arbogastes in 394. Theodosius died at Milan, four months after the defeat of Eugenius, on the 17th of January, 395. His two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, had already been elevated to the rank of Augusti, and it was arranged that the Empire should be divided between them, Arcadius having the East, and Honorius the West. Theodosius was a firm Catholic, and a fierce opponent and persecutor of the Arians and all heretics. It was in his reign also that the formal destruction of paganism took place; and we still possess a large number of the laws of Theodosius, prohibiting the exercise of the pagan religion, and forbidding the heathen worship under severe penalties, in some cases extending to death.</p>
 <p>(2) A Roman emperor of the East, A.D. 408-450. He was born in 401, and was only seven years of age at the death of his father Arcadius, whom he succeeded. Theodosius was a weak ruler; and his sister Pulcheria, who became his guardian in 414, possessed the virtual <cb /> government of the Empire during the remainder of his long reign. The principal external events in the reign of Theodosius were the war with the Persians, which only lasted a short time (421-422), and was terminated by a peace for a hundred years; and the war with the Huns, who repeatedly defeated the armies of the emperor, and compelled him at length to conclude a disgraceful peace with them in 447 or 448. Theodosius died in 450, and was succeeded by his sister Pulcheria, who prudently took for her colleague in the Empire the senator Marcian, and made him her husband. Theodosius had been married in 421 to the accomplished Athenaïs, the daughter of the sophist Leontius, who received at her baptism the name of Eudocia. Their daughter Eudoxia was married to Valentinian III., the emperor of the West. In the reign of Theodosius, and that of Valentinian III., was made the compilation called the Codex Theodosianus. It was published in A.D. 438. It consists of sixteen books, which are divided into titles, with appropriate rubricae or headings; and the constitutions belonging to each title are arranged under it in chronological order. The first five books comprise the greater part of the constitution which relates to <seg lang="la">ius privatum;</seg> the sixth, seventh, and eighth books contain the law that relates to the constitution and administration; the ninth book treats of criminal law; the tenth and eleventh treat of the public revenue and some matters relating to procedure; the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth books treat of the constitution and the administration of towns and other corporations; and the sixteenth contains the law relating to ecclesiastical matters.</p>

He may have been born about 570, and would therefore have been eighty at the commencement of the Persian Wars, 490, at which time we know from his own writings that he was alive. Theognis belonged to the oligarchical party in his native city, and in its fates he shared. He was a noble by birth, and all his sympathies were with the nobles. They are, in his poems, the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθοί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐσθλοί</foreign>, and the commons the <foreign lang="greek">κακοί</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">δειλοί</foreign>, terms which, in fact, at that period, were regularly used in this political signification, and not in their later ethical meaning. He was banished with the leaders of the oligarchical party, having previously been deprived of all his property; and most of his poems were composed while 
<pb n="1567" /><cb />
 he was an exile. Most of his political verses are addressed to a certain Cyrnus, the son of Polypas. The other fragments of his poetry are of a social, most of them of a festive, character. They place us in the midst of a circle of friends who formed a kind of convivial society; all the members of this society belonged to the class whom the poet calls “the good.” The collection of gnomic poetry which has come down to us under the name of Theognis contains, however, many additions from later poets. The genuine fragments of Theognis, with some passages which are poetical in thought, have much that helps us to understand his times.</p>

He became the favourite pupil of Aristotle, who named Theophrastus his successor in the presidency of the Lyceum, and in his will bequeathed to him his library and the originals of his own writings. Theophrastus was a worthy successor of his great master, and nobly sustained the character of the school. He is said to have had two thousand disciples, and among them such men as the comic poet Menander. He was highly esteemed by the kings Philippus, Cassander, and Ptolemy, and was not the less the object of the regard of the Athenian people, as was decisively shown when he was impeached of impiety; for he was not only acquitted, but his accuser would have fallen a victim to his calumny had not Theophrastus generously interfered to save him.

 <p>(2) A Greek historian, born at Chios about B.C. 378. He left home, probably about 361, with his father, who was banished by the democratic party on account of his predilection for the Spartans, and, having been trained in oratory by Isocrates, spoke with great success in all the larger towns of Greece. He distinguished himself so greatly in the rhetorical contest instituted (351) by Queen Artemisia, wife of Mausolus, in honour of her deceased husband, that he obtained a brilliant victory over all competitors. He afterwards travelled, with the object of acquiring material for his historical works. The favour shown him by Alexander the Great induced him to return to Chios at the age of forty-five; but on the death of his patron he found himself again obliged to flee from his opponents, whose hatred he had incurred by his vehement adoption of the sentiments of the aristocracy. He took refuge with Ptolemy I., at Alexandria, about 305. Here he did not, however, meet with a favourable reception, and was compelled to withdraw, as his life was in danger. Of his subsequent career nothing is known.</p>
 <p>Besides numerous orations (principally panegyrics) he composed two large histories, founded on the most careful and minute research: <title>(a) Hellenica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑλληνικαὶ Ἱστορίαι</foreign>), in twelve books, a continuation of Thucydides, covering the period from 411- 394; and <title>(b) Philippica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Φιλιππικά</foreign>), in fifty-eight books, treating of the life and times of Philip of Macedon. Of these works only fragments remain. The charge of malignity, which was brought against him by the ancients, seems to have originated in the reckless manner in which, on the testimony of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (<title>Ep. ad Cn. Pompeium</title>), he exposed the pettiness and baseness of the politics of those times, especially those of the Macedonian party. There seems to be better foundation for the charge brought against him of being too fond of digressions; for when, in later times, the digressions in the <title>Philippica</title> were omitted, the work was thereby reduced to sixteen books. Theopompus was the first Greek writer to make any definite mention of Rome, speaking of its capture by the Gauls (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ θεωρικόν</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">χρῆμα</foreign>, “theatremoney”). Money devoted by the State to the public shows and festivals, or given to the people as legacies. A distribution of two obols (about $0.08) a head, granted from the time of Pericles to the poorer Athenian citizens, from the common war-chest (see <ref type="cross" target="crosshellenotamiae">Hellenotamiae</ref>), enabled them to attend the representations at the theatre, two obols being the entrance fee levied by the lessees <cb /> of the theatre. By degrees this grant was distributed to citizens who laid claim to it in the case of other entertainments, such as festivals and sacrifices. For the contests and games at the Panathenaea, Dionysia, Eleusinia, Thargelia, money was set apart by the State, while some of the expense was borne by individuals. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>.) The public treasury also defrayed a portion of the cost of the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games. It was abolished towards the end of the Poloponnesian War, but again introduced after the restoration of the democracy; and a special fund, to which, by a decree of the people, the whole surplus of the revenue was to be devoted, was set apart for this purpose, with a special treasurer, who had even for a time the management of the finances of the State. Demosthenes first succeeded, shortly before the battle of Chaeronea (B.C. 338), in putting an end to this system, which so severely taxed the resources of the State in time of war.

It lay between Mount Oeta and an inaccessible morass, forming the edge of the Malic Gulf. At one end of the pass, close to Anthela, the mountain approaches so close to the morass as to leave room for only a single carriage between; this narrow entrance formed the western gate of Thermopylae. About a mile to the east the mountain again approached close to the sea, near the Locrian town of Alpeni, thus forming the eastern gate of Thermopylae. The space between these two gates was wider and more open, and was distinguished by its abundant flow of hot springs, which were sacred to Heracles: hence the name of the place. Thermopylae was the only pass by which an enemy could penetrate from northern into southern Greece; whence its great importance in Grecian history. It is especially celebrated on account of the heroic defence of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans against the mighty host of Xerxes in B.C. 480; and they only fell through the Persians having discovered a path over the mountains, and thus being enabled to attack the Greeks in the rear. This mountain path commenced from the neighbourhood of Trachis, ascended the gorge of the river Asopus and the hill called Anopaea, then crossed the crest of Oeta, and descended in the rear of Thermopylae near the town of Alpeni ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 207" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 207</bibl>-228; Pausan. iv. 35, 9; x. 19-22).

Such were those at Olympia and Delphi. The subterranean tombs, shaped like beehives, and of a construction dating from remote Greek antiquity, which have been found in various places, have been wrongly described as “treasure-houses.” The most celebrated of these are the so-called thesaurus of Atreus at Mycenae (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclopes">Cyclopes</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref>), and that of Minyas at Orchomenus (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstrophonius">Trophonius</ref>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θησεύς</foreign>). The great national hero of Attic legend. He was the son of Aegeus, king of Athens, and of Aethra, the daughter of Pittheus, king of Troezen. This, however, was the Attic tradition, which aimed at making Theseus a prince of Athenian descent. The older legend of Troezen itself made Theseus the son of Poseidon (Pausan. i. 17, 3; <bibl n="Diod.  4. 59" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.iv. 59</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Thes.</title>6</bibl>;  <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 887" default="NO" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Hipp.</title>887</bibl>). Plutarch in his <title>Theseus</title> has gathered into a connected story various legends, some of Athenian origin, some from other countries: (1) his journey from Troezen to Athens, an Attic glorification of their hero;</p>
 <p>(2) the Cretan story of the Minotaur adapted to the Attic legends;</p>
 <p>(3) his later adventures, some of which are of Spartan origin. But the story may be related consecutively as Plutarch has given it.</p>
 <p>Theseus was brought up at Troezen, and when he reached maturity he took, by his mother's directions, the sword and sandals, the tokeus which had been left by Aegeus, and proceeded to Athens. Eager to emulate Heracles, he went by land, displaying his prowess by destroying the robbers and monsters that infested the country. Periphetes, Sinis, Phaea the Crommyonian sow, Sciron, Cercyon, and Procrustes fell before him. At Athens he was immediately recognized by Medea, who laid a plot for poisoning him at a banquet to which he was invited. By means of the sword which he carried, Theseus was recognized by Aegeus, acknowledged as his son, and declared his successor. The sons of Pallas, thus disappointed in their hopes of succeeding to the throne, attempted to secure <cb /> the succession by violence, and declared war, but, being betrayed by the herald Leos, were destroyed. The capture of the Marathonian bull, which had long laid waste the surrounding country, was the next exploit of Theseus. After this Theseus went of his own accord as one of the seven youths whom the Athenians were obliged to send every year, with seven maidens, to Crete, to be devoured by the Minotaur. When they arrived at Crete, Ariadné, the daughter of Minos, became enamoured of Theseus, and provided him with a sword with which he slew the Minotaur, and a clue of thread by which he found his way out of the labyrinth. Having effected his object, Theseus sailed away, carrying off Ariadné. There were various legends about Ariadné; but according to the general account Theseus abandoned her in the island of Naxos on his way home. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossariadne">Ariadné</ref>.) He was generally believed to have had by her two sons, Oenopion and Staphylus; yet this does not agree with the account in the <title>Odyssey</title>, which represents her as dying before her wedding with Theseus was brought about, and apparently after her union with Dionysus ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 11. 320" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xi. 320</bibl>). As the vessel in which Theseus sailed approached Attica, he neglected to hoist the white sail which was to have been the signal of the success of the expedition; whereupon Aegeus, thinking that his son had perished, threw himself into the sea. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaegeus">Aegeus</ref>.) Theseus thus became king of Athens. Other adventures followed, again repeating those of Heracles. Theseus is said to have assailed the Amazons before they had recovered from the attack of Heracles, and to have carried off their queen Antiopé. The Amazons in their turn invaded Attica, and penetrated into Athens itself; and the final battle in which Theseus overcame them was fought in the very midst of the city. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamazones">Amazones</ref>.) By Antiopé Theseus was said to have had a son named Hippolytus or Demophoön, and after her death to have married Phaedra. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshippolytus">Hippolytus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossphaedra">Phaedra</ref>.)</p>
 <p>Theseus figures in almost all the great heroic expeditions. He was one of the Argonauts (the anachronism of the attempt of Medea to poison him does not seem to have been noticed); he joined in the Calydonian hunt, and aided Adrastus in recovering the bodies of those slain before Thebes. He contracted a close friendship with Pirithoüs, and aided him and the Lapithae against the Centaurs. With the assistance of Pirithoüs he carried off Helen from Sparta while she was quite a girl, and placed her at Aphidnae, under the care of Aethra. In return he assisted Pirithoüs in his attempt to carry off Persephoné from the lower world. Pirithoüs perished in the enterprise, and Theseus was kept in hard durance until he was delivered by Heracles. Meantime Castor and Pollux invaded Attica, and carried off Helen and Aethra, Academus having informed the brothers where they were to be found. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacademus">Academus</ref>.) Menestheus also endeavoured to incite the people against Theseus, who on his return found himself unable to re-establish his authority, and retired to Scyros, where he met with a treacherous death at the hands of Lycomedes. The departed hero was believed to have appeared to aid the Athenians at the battle of Marathon. In 469 the bones of Theseus were discovered by Cimon in Scyros, and brought to Athens, where they were deposited in a temple (the Theseum) erected in honour of the 
<pb n="1571" /><cb />
 hero. A considerable part of this temple still remains, forming one of the most interesting monuments of Athens. A festival in honour of Theseus was celebrated on the eighth day of each month, especially in Pyanepsion. See p. 151.</p>
 <p>There can be no doubt that Theseus is a purely legendary personage. Nevertheless, in later times the Athenians came to regard him as the author of a very important political revolution in Attica. Before his time Attica had been broken up into twelve petty independent States or townships, acknowledging no head, and connected only by a federal union. Theseus abolished the separate governments, and erected Athens into the capital of a single commonwealth. The festival of the <ref type="cross" target="crosspanathenaea">Panathenaea</ref> (q.v.) was instituted to commemorate this important revolution. Theseus is said to have established a constitutional government, retaining in his own hands only certain definite powers and functions. He is further said to have distributed the Athenian citizens into the three classes of Eupatridae, Geomori, and Demiurgi. It would be a vain task to attempt to decide whether there is any historical basis for the legends about Theseus, and still more so to endeavour to separate the historical from the legendary in what has been preserved. The Theseus of the Athenians was a hero who fought the Amazons, and slew the Minotaur, and carried off Helen. A personage who should be nothing more than a wise king, consolidating the Athenian commonwealth, however possible his existence might be, would have no historical reality. The connection of Theseus with Poseidon, the national deity of the Ionic tribes, his coming from the Ionic town Troezen, forcing his way through the Isthmus into Attica, and establishing the Isthmia as an Ionic Panegyris, rather suggest that Theseus is, at least in part, the mythological representative of an Ionian immigration into Attica, which, adding perhaps to the strength and importance of Ionian settlers already in the country, might easily have led to that political aggregation of the disjointed elements of the State which is assigned to Theseus.

It was held at Athens from the ninth to the thirteenth of the month Pyanepsion (the beginning of November), and only by married women of genuine Attic birth and of blameless reputation. Two of the wealthiest and most distinguished women were chosen out of every district to preside over the festivals; their duty was to perform the sacred functions in the name of the others, and to prepare the festal meal for the women of their own district. Even the priestess, who had the chief conduct of the whole festival, had to be a married woman. On the Stenia, the first day of the feast (<foreign lang="greek">Στήνια</foreign>), the women went in procession, amid wanton jests and gibes, to the deme of Halimus, on the promontory of Colias, where nightly celebrations were held in the Temple of Demeter and her daughter Coré. After their return (<foreign lang="greek">ἄνοδος</foreign>) in the early morning of the third day, a festival lasting for three days was held in Athens. No sacrifices were offered on the last day but one, which was spent amid fasting and mourning. On the last day, on which Demeter was invoked under the name of Calligeneia, “goddess of fair children,” a feast (<foreign lang="greek">ζημία</foreign>) was held <cb /> amid mimic dances and games, which probably referred to the mythical stories of the goddess and her daughter. See Preller, <title>Demeter und Persephoné</title>, pp. 335-365; A. Mommsen, <title>Heortologie</title>, pp. 287-302.

<head orig="Thespis">Thespis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θέσπις</foreign>). The father of Greek Tragedy. He was a contemporary of Pisistratus, and a native of Icarus, one of the demes in Attica, where the worship of Dionysus had long prevailed. The alteration made by Thespis , which gave to the old Tragedy a new and dramatic character, was very simple but very important. Before his time the leader of the Chorus had recited the adventures of Dionysus and had been answered by the Chorus. Thespis introduced an actor (<foreign lang="greek">ὑποκριτής</foreign>, or “answerer”) to reply to the leader of the Chorus. It is clear that, though the performance still remained, as far as can be gathered, chiefly lyrical, and the dialogue was of comparatively small account, yet a decided step towards the drama had been made. Some modern scholars have credited Horace's statement that Thespis went about in a wagon as a strolling player (<title>A. P.</title> 276). It is suggested that the expressions for the freedom of jesting at the festival of the Lenaea (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἐξ ἁμαξῶν, ἐξ ἁμάξης ὑβρίζειν</foreign>) may have given rise to the story.

<head orig="Thessalia">Thessalia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεσσαλία</foreign>). The largest division of Greece. It was bounded on the north by the Cambunian Mountains, which separated it from Macedonia; on the west by Mount Pindus, which separated it from Epirus; on the east by the Aegaean Sea; and on the south by the Maliac Gulf and Mount Oeta, which separated it from Locris, Phocis, and Aetolia. Thessaly proper is a vast plain, 
<pb n="1572" /><cb />
 shut in on every side by mountain barriers, broken only at the northeastern corner by the valley and defile of Tempé, which separates Ossa from Olympus. This plain is drained by the river Peneus and its affluents, and is said to have been originally a vast lake, the waters of which were afterwards carried off through the vale of Tempé by some sudden convulsion which rent the rocks of this valley asunder. In addition to the plain already described, there were two other districts included under the general name of Thessaly: one called Magnesia, being a long, narrow strip of country extending along the coast of the Aegaean Sea from Tempé to the Pagasaean Gulf, and bounded on the west by Mounts Ossa and Olympus; and the other being a long, narrow vale at the extreme south of the country, lying between Mounts Othrys and Oeta, and drained by the river Spercheus. Thessaly proper was divided in very early times into four districts or tetrarchies—a division which we still find existing in the Poloponnesian War. These districts were: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <ref type="cross" target="crosshestiaeotis">Hestiaeōtis</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑστιαιῶτις</foreign>), the northwestern part of Thessaly, bounded on the north by Macedonia, on the west by Epirus, on the east by Pelasgiotis, and on the south by Thessaliotis; the Peneus may be said in general to have formed its southern limit. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <ref type="cross" target="crosspelasgiotis">Pelasgiōtis</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Πελασγιῶτις</foreign>), the eastern part of the Thessalian plain, bounded on the north by Macedonia, on the west by Hestiaeotis, on the east by Magnesia, and on the south by the Sinus Pagasaeus and Phthiotis. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Thessaliōtis</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεσσαλιῶτις</foreign>), the southwestern part of the Thessalian plain, bounded on the north by Hestiaeotis, on the west by Epirus, on the east by Pelasgiotis, and on the south by Dolopia and Phthiotis. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <ref type="cross" target="crossphthiotis">Phthiōtis</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Φθιῶτις</foreign>), the southeast of Thessaly, bounded on the north by Thessaliotis, on the west by Dolopia, on the south by the Sinus Maliacus, and on the east by the Pagasaean Gulf. It is in this district that Homer places Phthia and Hellas proper, and the dominions of Achilles. Besides these there were four other districts, viz.: (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) <ref type="cross" target="crossmagnesia">Magnesia</ref>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmagnesia">Magnesia</ref>.) (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dolopia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Δολοπία</foreign>), a small district bounded on the east by Phthiotis, on the north by Thessaliotis, on the west by Athamania, and on the south by Oetaea. The Dolopes were an ancient people, for they are not only mentioned by Homer as fighting before Troy, but they also sent deputies to the Amphictyonic assembly. (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Oetaea</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Οἰταῖα</foreign>), a district in the upper valley of the Spercheus, lying between Mounts Othrys and Oeta, and bounded on the north by Dolopia, on the <figure id="fig.01572">

 <p>The Thessalians were a Thesprotian tribe, and, under the guidance of leaders who are said to have been descendants of Heracles, invaded the western part of the country, afterwards called Thessaliotis, whence they subsequently spread over the other <cb /> parts of the country. For some time after the conquest, Thessaly was governed by kings of the race of Heracles; but the kingly power seems to have been abolished in early times, and the government in the separate cities became oligarchical, the power being chiefly in the hands of a few great families descended from the ancient kings. Of these, two of the most powerful were the Aleuadae and the Scopadae, the former of whom ruled at Larissa, and the latter at Cranon (or Crannon). At an early period the Thessalians were united into a confederate body. Each of the four districts into which the country was divided probably regulated its affairs by some kind of provincial council; and in case of war a chief magistrate was elected, under the name of Tagus (<foreign lang="greek">Ταγός</foreign>), whose commands were obeyed by all the four districts. This confederacy, however, was not of much practical benefit to the Thessalian people, and appears to have been only used by the Thessalian nobles as a means of cementing and maintaining their power. The Thessalians never became of much importance in Grecian history. In B.C. 344 Philip completely subjected Thessaly to Macedonia, by placing at the head of the four divisions of the country governors devoted to his interests. The victory of T. Flamininus at Cynoscephalae, in 197, again gave the Thessalians a semblance of independence under the protection of the Romans.

An ancient city in Macedonia, situated at the northeastern extremity of the Sinus Thermaïcus. Under the name of Therma it was not a place of much importance.

It was made an important city by Cassander, who collected in this place the inhabitants of several adjacent towns (about B.C. 315), and who gave it the name of Thessalonica in honour of his wife, the daughter of Philip and sister of Alexander the Great. From this time it became a large and flourishing city. It was visited by the Apostle Paul about A.D. 53, and about two years afterwards he addressed from Corinth two epistles to his converts in the city.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θέτις</foreign>). A daughter of Nereus and Doris. She was the wife of Peleus, by whom she became the mother of Achilles ( <bibl n="Hom.

As a goddess of the sea she dwelt, like her sisters the Nereids, below the waves with her father, Nereus. She there received Dionysus on his flight from Lycurgus, and the god, in his gratitude, presented her with a golden urn ( <bibl n="Hom.

When Hephaestus was thrown down from heaven, he was likewise received by Thetis. She had been brought up by Heré, and when she reached the age of maturity, Zeus and Heré gave her, against her will, in marriage to Peleus. Such was the Homeric story ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 85" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 85</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 432" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 432</bibl>); but later accounts add that Poseidon and Zeus himself first sued for her hand; but when Themis declared that the son of Thetis would be stronger than his father, both gods desisted from their suit, and desired her marriage with a mortal ( <title>Isthm.</title> viii. 58). Chiron informed his friend Peleus how he might gain possession of her, even if she should metamorphose herself: for Thetis, like Proteus, had the power of assuming any form she pleased; and she had recourse to this means of escaping from Peleus, who, instructed by Chiron, held the goddess fast till she again assumed her proper form, and promised to marry him ( <bibl n="Pind. N. 3. 60" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Nem.</title>iii. 60</bibl>). This story, which appears first in Pindar, was a favourite subject in vasepainting of an early date. The wedding of Peleus was honoured with the presence of all the gods, with the exception of Eris or Discord, who was not invited, and who avenged herself by throwing among the assembled gods the apple which was the source of so much misery.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θώραξ</foreign>). The Greek term for a cuirass, either of metal (usually bronze) or of leather. The metal cuirass consisted of two separate pieces, one covering the chest and stomach, and the other the back, attached to one another by means of clasps or buckles. They terminated with a curved edge just above the hip, and at this part were often covered with a leathern belt (<foreign lang="greek">ζωστήρ</foreign>), fastened with buckles, to bind both pieces more firmly together. Another belt (<foreign lang="greek">μίτρα</foreign>), lined with leather, was worn under the armour and above the chiton. This was fitted with a plate of metal growing broader towards the middle and serving to protect the belly. In later times the front plate of the cuirass was extended downwards, so as to cover the belly as far as the navel. As an additional protection to the belly and the upper part of the legs, there was on the inner side of the lower edge of the cuirass a series of short strips of leather or felt, covered with plates of metal, often in several layers. They resembled a kilt, and were called <foreign lang="greek">πτέρυγες</foreign> (“feathers”). Smaller strips of the same kind were worn under the arms to protect the armpits.</p>
 <p>The leather cuirass (<foreign lang="greek">σπολάς</foreign>) was a kind of shirt reaching over the navel and hips, and fringed with <cb /> <figure id="fig.01574">
<head orig="Thoraces. (From Greek vases.)">Thoraces. (From Greek vases.)</head>
</figure> flexible strips along its lower edge. It was open either in front or on one side (usually the left), and was there fastened together by means of clasps or buckles. It was also provided with an upright piece protecting the neck, and with two shoulderstraps. It was frequently covered, either completely, or only under the arms, with metal, especially in the form of scales.</p>
 <p>Linen cuirasses are also mentioned, even in ancient times. These were probably either thickly quilted or strongly woven corselets.</p>

<head orig="Thracia">Thracia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θρᾴκη</foreign>, Ion. <foreign lang="greek">Θρῄκη</foreign>). In earlier times the name of the vast space of country bounded on the north by the Danube, on the south by the Propontis and the Aegaean, on the east by the Pontus Euxinus, and on the west by the river Strymon and the easternmost of the Illyrian tribes. It was divided into two parts by Mount Haemus (the Balkan), running from west to east, and separating the plain of the lower Danube from the rivers which fall into the Aegaean. Its plains are drained by the Hebrus, the largest river in Thrace. At a later time the name Thrace was applied to a more limited extent of country. The district between the Strymon and the Nestus was added to Macedonia by Philip, and was usually called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Macedonia Adiecta</hi>. Under Augustus the part of the country north of the Haemus was made a separate Roman province under the name of Moesia (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmoesia">Moesia</ref>); but the district between the Strymon and the Nestus had been previously restored to Thrace by the Romans. The Roman province of Thrace 
<pb n="1575" /><cb />
 was accordingly bounded on the west by the river Nestus; on the north by Mount Haemus, which divided it from Moesia; on the east by the Euxine, and on the south by the Propontis and Aegean.</p>
 <p>Thrace, in its widest extent, was peopled in the times of Herodotus and Thucydides by a vast number of different tribes; but their customs and characters were marked by great uniformity. Herodotus says that, next to the Indians, the Thracians were the most numerous of all races, and if united under one head would have been irresistible. He describes them as a savage, cruel, and rapacious people, delighting in blood, but brave and warlike. According to his account, which is confirmed by other writers, the Thracian chiefs sold their children for exportation to the foreign merchant; they purchased their wives from their parents; they punctured or tattooed their bodies and those of the women belonging to them, as a sign of noble birth; they despised agriculture, and considered it most honourable to live by war and robbery. Deep drinking prevailed among them extensively ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 27</bibl>). They worshipped deities whom the Greeks assimilated to Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis: the great sanctuary and oracle of their god Dionysus was in one of the loftiest summits of Mount Rhodopé. The tribes on the southern coast attained to some degree of civilization, owing to the numerous Greek colonies which were founded in their vicinity; but the tribes in the interior seem to have retained their savage habits, with little mitigation, down to the time of the Roman Empire. In earlier times, however, some of the Thracian tribes must have been distinguished by a higher degree of civilization than prevailed among them at a later period. The earliest Greek poets, Orpheus, Linus , Musaeus, and others, are all represented as coming from Thrace. Eumolpus, likewise, who founded the Eleusinian Mysteries at Attica, is said to have been a Thracian, and to have fought against Erectheus, king of Athens. We also find mention of the Thracians in other parts of southern Greece: thus they are said to have once dwelt both in Phocis and Boeotia. They were also spread over a part of Asia: the Thynians and Bithynians, and perhaps also the Mysians, were members of the great Thracian race. Even Xenophon speaks of Thrace in Asia, which extended along the Asiatic side of the Bosporus, as far as Heraclea.</p>
 <p>The principal Greek colonies along the coast, beginning at the Strymon and going eastwards, were Amphipolis, at the mouth of the Strymon; Abdera, a little to the west of the Nestus; Dicaea or Dicaepolis, a settlement of Maronea; Maronea itself, colonized by the Chians; Strymé, a colony of the Thasians; Mesembria, founded by the Samothracians; and Aenos, a Lesbian colony at the mouth of the Hebrus. The Thracian Chersonesus was probably colonized by the Greeks at an early period, but it did not contain any important Greek settlement till the migration of the first Miltiades to the country, during the reign of Pisistratus at Athens. On the Propontis the two chief Greek settlements were those of Perinthus and Selymbria; and on the Thracian Bosporus was the important town of Byzantium. There were only a few Greek settlements on the southwestern coast of the Euxine; the most important were those of Apollonia, Odessus, Callatis, Tomi, renowned as the <cb /> place of Ovid's banishment, and Istria, near the southern mouth of the Danube.</p>
 <p>The Thracians are said to have been conquered by Sesostris, king of Egypt, and subsequently to have been subdued by the Teucrians and Mysians; but the first really historical fact respecting them is their subjugation by Megabazus, the general of Darius. After the Persians had been driven out of Europe by the Greeks, the Thracians recovered their independence; and at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, almost all the Thracian tribes were united under the dominion of Sitalces, king of the Odrysae, whose kingdom extended from Abdera to the Euxine and the mouth of the Danube. In the third year of the Peloponnesian War (B.C. 429), Sitalces, who had entered into an alliance with the Athenians, invaded Macedonia with a vast army of 150,000 men, but was compelled by the failure of provisions to return home, after remaining in Macedonia thirty days. Sitalces fell in battle against the Triballi in 424, and was succeeded by his nephew Seuthes, who during a long reign raised his kingdom to a height of power and prosperity which it had never previously attained, so that his regular revenues amounted to the annual sum of 400 talents, in addition to contributions of gold and silver in the form of presents, to a nearly equal amount. After the death of Seuthes, which appears to have happened a little before the close of the Peloponnesian War, we find his powerful kingdom split up into different parts; and when Xenophon, with the remains of the 10,000 Greeks, arrived on the opposite coast of Asia, another Senthes applied to him for assistance to reinstate him in his dominions. Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, reduced the greater part of Thrace; and after the death of Alexander the country fell to the share of Lysimachus. It subsequently formed a part of the Macedonian dominions, but it continued to be governed by its native princes, and was only nominally subject to the Macedonian monarchs. Even under the Romans Thrace was for a long time governed by its own chiefs; and we do not know at what period it was made into a Roman province.</p>

He confirmed the faith of Tiberius in his skill by casting his own horoscope as well as that of his master, and saying that he himself had reached a great crisis of danger, having suspected, as was the truth, that Tiberius was on the point of having him thrown over a precipice. This proof of prophetic power saved his life. He died in A.D. 36, the year before Tiberius, and is said to have saved the lives of many persons whom Tiberius would otherwise have put to death, by falsely predicting for this very purpose that the emperor would live a certain period longer than his intended victims.

<div2 id="crossthucydides" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Thucydĭdes">Thucydides</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Θουκυδίδης</foreign>). (1) An Athenian statesman, of the deme Alopecé, son of Melesias. After the death of Cimon in B.C. 449, Thucydides became the leader of the aristocratic party, which he concentrated and more thoroughly organized in opposition to Pericles. He left two sons, Melesias and Stephanus; and a son of the former of these, named Thucydides after his grandfather, was a pupil of Socrates.</p>
 <p>(2) The great Athenian historian, the <cb /> son of Olorus or Orolus and Hegesipylé. He is said to have been connected with the family of Cimon; and we know that Miltiades, the conqueror of Marathon, married Hegesipylé, the daughter of a Thracian king called Olorus, by whom she became the mother of Cimon; and it has been conjectured with much probability that the mother of Thucydides was a granddaughter of Miltiades and Hegesipylé. According to a statement of Pamphila , Thucydides was forty years of age at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War (B.C. 431), and accordingly he was born in 471. There is a story in Lucian of Herodotus having read his History at the Olympic Games to the assembled Greeks; and Suidas adds that Thucydides, then a boy, was present, and shed tears of emulation—a presage of his own future historical distinction. But this celebrated story ought probably to be rejected as a fable. Thucydides is said to have been instructed in oratory by Antiphon, and in philosophy by Anaxagoras; but whether these statements are to be received cannot be determined. It is certain, however, that, being an Athenian of a good family, and living in a city which was the centre of Greek civilization, he must have had the best possible education; that he was a man of great ability and cultivated understanding his work clearly shows. He informs us that he possessed gold-mines in that part of Thrace which is opposite to the island of Thasos, and that he was a person of the greatest influence among those in that part of Thrace. This property, according to some accounts, he had from his ancestors; according to other accounts, he married a rich woman of Scaptesyle, and received it as a portion with her. Thucydides left a son called Timotheus; and a daughter also is mentioned, who is said by some to have written the eighth book of the History of Thucydides. Thucydides (ii. 48) was one of those who suffered from the great plague of Athens, and one of the few who recovered. We have no trustworthy evidence of Thucydides having distinguished himself as an orator, though it is not unlikely that he did, for his oratorical talent is shown by the speeches that he has inserted in his history. He was, however, employed in a military capacity, and he was in command of an Athenian squadron of seven ships, at Thasus, B.C. 424, when Eucles, who commanded in Amphipolis, sent for his assistance against Brasidas, who was before that town with an army. Brasidas, fearing the arrival of a superior force, 
<pb n="1577" /><cb />
 offered favourable terms to Amphipolis, which were readily accepted, for there were few Athenians in the place, and the rest did not wish to make resistance. Thucydides arrived at Eion, at the mouth of the Strymon, on the evening of the same day on which Amphipolis surrendered; and though he was too late to save Amphipolis, he prevented Eion from falling into the hands of the enemy. In consequence of this failure, Thucydides became an exile, probably to avoid a severer punishment; for Cleon, who was at this time in great favour with the Athenians, appears to have excited popular suspicion against him. There are various untrustworthy accounts as to his places of residence during his exile; but we may conclude that he could not safely reside in any place which was under Athenian dominion, and as he kept his eye on the events of the war, he must have lived in those parts which belonged to the Spartan alliance. His own words certainly imply that, during his exile, he spent much of his time either in the Peloponnesus, or in places which were under Peloponnesian influence (v. 26); and his work was the result of his own experience and observations. His minute description of Syracuse and the neighbourhood leads to the probable conclusion that he was personally acquainted with the localities; and if he visited Sicily, it is probable that he also saw some parts of southern Italy. Thucydides says that he lived twenty years in exile (v. 26), and as his exile commenced in the beginning of 423, he may have returned to Athens in the beginning of 403, about the time when Thrasybulus liberated Athens. Thucydides is said to have been assassinated at Athens soon after his return; but other accounts place his death in Thrace. There is a general agreement, however, among the ancient authorities that he came to a violent end. His death cannot be placed later than 401.</p>
 <p>The time when he composed his work has been a matter of dispute. He informs us himself that he was busy in collecting materials all through the war from the beginning to the end (i. 22), and of course he would register them as he got them. Plutarch says that he wrote the work in Thrace; but the work in the shape in which we have it was certainly not finished until after the close of the war, and he was probably engaged upon it at the time of his death. A question has been raised as to the authorship of the eighth and last book of Thucydides, which breaks off in the middle of the twenty-first year of the war (411). It differs from all the other books in containing no speeches, and it has also been supposed to be inferior to the rest as a piece of composition. Accordingly, several ancient critics supposed that the eighth book was not by Thucydides: some attributed it to his daughter, and some to Xenophon or Theopompus, because both of them continued the history. The words with which Xenophon's <title>Hellenica</title> commence (<foreign lang="greek">μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα</foreign>) may chiefly have led to the supposition that he was the author, for his work is made to appear as a continuation of that of Thucydides. But this argument is in itself of little weight; and, besides, both the style of the eighth book is different from that of Xenophon, and the manner of treating the subject, for the division of the year into summers and winters, which Thucydides has observed in his first seven books, is continued in the eighth, but is not observed by Xenophon. The rhetorical style of Theopompus, which was the <cb /> characteristic of his writing, renders it also improbable that he was the author of the eighth book. It seems the simplest supposition to consider Thucydides himself as the author of this book, since he names himself as the author twice (viii. 6, 60); though it is probable that he had not the opportunity of revising it with the same care as the first seven books. It is stated by an ancient writer that Xenophon made the work of Thucydides known, which may be true, as he wrote the first two books of his <title>Hellenica</title>, or the part which now ends with the second book, for the purpose of completing the history. The work of Thucydides, from the commencement of the second book, is chronologically divided into winters and summers, and each summer and winter make a year (ii. 1). His summer comprises the time from the vernal to <figure id="fig.01577">
<head orig="Thucydides. (Norfolk.)">Thucydides. (Norfolk.)</head>
</figure> the autumnal equinox, and the winter comprises the period from the autumnal to the vernal equinox. The division into books and chapters was probably made by the Alexandrian critics. The history of the Peloponnesian War opens the second book of Thucydides, and the first is introductory to the history.</p>
 <p>He begins his first book by observing that the Peloponnesian War was the most important event in Grecian history, which he shows by a rapid review of the history of the Greeks from the earliest period to the commencement of the war (i. 1-21). After his introductory chapters he proceeds to explain the alleged grounds and causes of the war: the real causes were, he says, the Spartan jealousy of the Athenian power. His narrative is interrupted (chs. 89-118), after he has come to the time when the Lacedaemonians resolved on war, by a digression on the rise and progress of the power of Athens; a period which had been either omitted 
<pb n="1578" /><cb /> by other writers, or treated imperfectly, and with little regard to chronology, as by Hellanicus in his Attic history (ch. 97). He resumes his narrative (ch. 119) with the negotiations that preceded the war; but this leads to another digression of some length on the treason of Pausanias (chs. 128-134), and the exile of Themistocles (chs. 135-138). He concludes the book with the speech of Pericles, who advised the Athenians to refuse the demands of the Peloponnesians; and his subject, as already observed, begins with the second book.</p>
 <p>A history which treats of so many events, which took place at remote spots, could only be written, in the time of Thucydides, by a man who took great pains to ascertain facts by personal inquiry. In modern times facts are made known by printing as soon as they occur; and the printed records of the time, such as newspapers, are often the only evidence of many facts which become history. When we know the careless way in which facts are now reported and recorded by incompetent persons, often upon very indifferent hearsay testimony, and compare with such records the pains that Thucydides took to ascertain the chief events of a war with which he was contemporary, in which he took a share as a commander, the opportunities which his means allowed, his great abilities, and serious, earnest character, it is a fair conclusion that we have as exact a history of a long eventful period by Thucydides as we have of any period in modern times.</p>
 <p>The work of Thucydides shows the most scrupulous care and diligence in ascertaining facts; his strict attention to chronology, and the importance that he attaches to it, are additional proof of his historical accuracy. His narrative is brief and concise to a degree which makes the thought, or the crowd of thoughts, concentrated in a short and involved sentence often hard to understand; it generally contains bare facts expressed in the fewest possible words, but this stern and apparently passionless brevity is able to produce a pathos unsurpassed by any prose-writer. This is seen most notably in his account of the Athenian catastrophe at Syracuse. Few can read it (and there are other passages almost as moving in the history) without agreeing with the opinion of Macaulay, that nothing finer has been written in prose. But it is still more important to notice that Thucydides is the founder of philosophical history. He first showed that a great historian should not merely narrate events accurately, should not even content himself with a critical examination of his authorities, but should also try to trace the causes of events, and their consequences, their teaching in politics, and the light which they throw upon character. Many of his speeches are political essays, or materials for them; they are not mere imaginations of his own for rhetorical effect; they contain in many cases the general sense of what was actually delivered as nearly as he could ascertain, and in many instances he had good opportunities of knowing what was said, for he heard some speeches delivered (i. 22); but they are employed to show the motives and sentiments of the speakers and of their partisans or countrymen.</p>
 <p>The number of existing manuscripts of Thucydides is about fifty, the oldest being the Codex Laurentianus (Florence) of the tenth century. Among the best are the Codex Cassellanus (Cassel), dated 1252, <cb /> the Codex Augustanus (formerly at Augsburg, now in Munich), the Codex Cantabrigiensis (Cambridge), the Codex Palatinus (Heidelberg) of the eleventh century, and a Codex Vaticanus of somewhat later date.

It is first noticed by Pythius, the Greek navigator of Massilia (Marseilles), who says that it was six days' sail from Britain. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspythius">Pythius</ref>.) In literature it was accepted as the most northerly part of the earth ( <bibl n="Verg. G. 1. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>i. 30</bibl>), whence the phrase “ultima Thulé.”

It has been supposed that Albula was the Latin and Tiberis the Etruscan name of the river. The Tiber rises in the Apennines, near Tifernum, and flows in a southwesterly direction, separating Etruria from Umbria, the land of the Sabines, and Latium. After flowing about 110 miles it receives the Nar (Nera), and from its confluence with this river its regular navigation begins. Three miles above Rome, at the distance of nearly seventy miles from the Nar, it receives the Anio (Teverone), and from this point becomes a river of considerable importance. Within the walls of Rome, the Tiber is about 300 feet wide and from twelve to eighteen 
<pb n="1580" /><cb />
 feet deep. After heavy rains the river in ancient times, as at the present day, frequently overflowed its banks, and did considerable mischief to the lower parts of the city ( <bibl n="Liv.  24. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxiv. 9</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  30. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., xxx. 38</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  35. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., xxxv. 9</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 21</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  38. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., xxxviii. 28</bibl>; Dio Cass. xxxix. 61, liii. 20).

At Rome the maritime navigation of the river begins; and at eighteen miles from the city, and about four miles from the coast, it divides into two arms, forming an island, which was sacred to Venus and called Insula Sacra (Isola Sagra). The left branch of the river runs into the sea by Ostia, which was the ancient harbour of Rome; but in consequence of the accumulation of sand at the mouth of the left branch, the right branch was widened by Trajan, and was made the regular harbour of the city under the name of Portus Romanus, Portus Augusti, or simply Portus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossostia">Ostia</ref>.) The whole length of the Tiber, with its windings, is about 200 miles. The waters of the river are muddy and yellowish, whence it is frequently called by the Roman poets <title>flavus Tiberis.</title> The poets also give it the epithets of <title>Tyrrhenus</title>, because it flowed past Etruria during the whole of its course, and of <title>Lydius</title>, because the Etruscans are said to have been of Lydian origin.

<div2 id="crosstiberius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tiberius">Tiberius</head>

 <p> (1) An emperor of Rome from A.D. 14 to 37. His full name was <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar</hi>. He was the son of T. Claudius Nero and of Livia, and was born on the 16th of November, B.C. 42, before his mother married Augustus. Tiberius was tall and strongly made, and his health was good. His face was handsome, and his eyes large. He was carefully educated, and became well acquainted with Greek and Latin literature, his master in rhetoric being Theodorus of Gadara. Though not without military courage, as his life shows, he had a great timidity of character, and was of a jealous and suspicious temper; and these qualities rendered him cruel after he had acquired power. There can be little doubt that his morose reserve and his dissimulation had been increased, if not created, by his relations to Augustus. As emperor the difficulties of his position, and the influence of Livia and still more of Seianus, increased his tendency to jealousy and suspicion of all who seemed rivals or dangerous from their popularity. The system of espionage and delation (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdelatores">Delatores</ref>) once begun could only increase with each act of tyranny and cruelty, till his rule became a veritable reign of terror. Yet in reading his history, especially the tales of his monstrous and incredible licentiousness, it must be recollected that Tacitus and Suetonius both wrote with a strong bias against him and his rule, and were ready to accept as true the worst scandals which were handed down. If Velleius was prejudiced in the other direction, it is at least right to adopt some part of his less unfavourable portrait and to imagine that the old age of Tiberius was not so absolutely contradictory of his youth as it is sometimes made to appear. The cruelty of his rule applied only to Rome. The testimony of Iosephus and Philo shows that his provincial government was just and lenient.</p>
 <p>In B.C. 11, Augustus compelled Tiberius, much against his will, to divorce his wife, Vipsania Agrippina, and to marry Iulia, the widow of Agrippa, and daughter of the emperor, with whom <cb /> Tiberius, however, did not long live in harmony. Tiberius was thus brought into still closer contact with the imperial family; but as Gaius and Lucius Caesar, the grandsons of Augustus, were still living, the prospect of Tiberius succeeding to the imperial power seemed very remote. He was employed on various military services. In 20, he was sent by Augustus to restore Tigranes to the throne of Armenia. It was during this campaign that Horace addressed one of his epistles to Iulius Florus (i. 12), who was serving under Tiberius. In 15, Drusus and his brother Tiberius were engaged in warfare with the Raeti, and the exploits of the two brothers were sung by Horace ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>iv. 4</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 14</bibl>). In 13, Tiberius was consul with P. Quintilius Varus. In 11, while his brother Drusus was fighting against the Germans, Tiberius conducted the war against the Dalmatians and against the Pannonians. Drusus died in 9, owing to a fall from his horse. On the news of the accident, Tiberius was sent by Augustus to Drusus, whom he found just alive. Tiberius returned to the war in Germany, and crossed the Rhine. In 7 he was consul a second time. In 6 he obtained the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg> for five years, but during this year he retired with the emperor's permission to Rhodes, where he spent the next seven years. Tacitus says that his chief reason for leaving Rome was to get away from his wife, who treated him with contempt, and whose licentious life was no secret to her husband; probably, too, he was unwilling to stay at Rome when the grandsons of Augustus were attaining years of maturity, for there was mutual jealousy between them and Tiberius. He returned to Rome A.D. 2. He was relieved from one trouble during his absence, for his wife Iulia had been banished to the island of <figure id="fig.01580">
<head orig="Tiberius. (Vatican.)">Tiberius. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> Pandataria (B.C. 2), and he never saw her again. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossiulia">Iulia</ref>.) After the deaths of L. Caesar (A.D. 2) and C. Caesar (A.D. 4), Augustus adopted Tiberius, with the view of leaving to him the imperial power; and at the same time he required Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, the son of his brother Drusus, though Tiberius had a son Drusus by his wife Vipsania. From the year of his adoption to the death of Augustus, Tiberius was in command of the Roman armies, though he visited Rome several times. He was sent into Germany A.D. 4. He reduced all Illyricum to subjection A.D. 9; and in A.D. 12 he had the honour of a triumph at Rome for his German and Dalmatian victories.</p>
 <p>On the death of Augustus at Nola, on the 19th of August, A.D. 14, Tiberius, who was on his way to Illyricum, was immediately summoned home by his mother, Livia. He assumed the imperial power without any opposition, affecting all the while a great reluctance. He began his reign by putting to death Postumus Agrippa, the surviving grandson of Augustus, and he alleged that it was done pursuant to the command of the late emperor. When he felt himself sure in his place, he began to strengthen the principate. He took from 
<pb n="1581" /><cb />
 the popular assembly the election of the magistrates, and transferred it to the Senate. The news of the death of Augustus roused a mutiny among the legions in Pannonia, which was quelled by Drusus, the son of Tiberius. The armies on the Rhine under Germanicus showed a disposition to reject Tiberius, and if Germanicus had been inclined to try the fortune of a campaign, he might have had the assistance of the German armies against his uncle. But Germanicus restored discipline to the army by his firmness, and maintained his fidelity to the new emperor. The first year of his reign was marked by the death of Iulia, whom Augustus had removed from Pandataria to Rhegium. The death of Germanicus in the East, in A.D. 19, relieved Tiberius from all fear of a rival claimant to the throne; and it was believed by many that Germanicus had been poisoned by order of Tiberius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgermanicus-caesar">Germanicus</ref>.) From this time Tiberius began to indulge with less restraint in his love of tyranny, and many distinguished senators were soon put to death on the charge of treason against the emperor (<seg lang="la">laesa maiestas</seg>). Notwithstanding his suspicious nature, Tiberius gave his complete confidence to Seianus, who for many years possessed the real government of the State. This ambitious man aimed at the imperial power. In 23, Drusus, the son of Tiberius, was poisoned by the contrivance of Seianus. Three years afterwards (26) Tiberius left Rome, and withdrew into Campania. He never returned to the city. He left on the pretext of dedicating temples in Campania, but the real cause was probably his dislike to Rome, where he knew that he was unpopular; and Seianus was only too anxious to encourage any feeling which would keep the emperor at a distance from the city. That Tiberius went because he wished to hide his licentiousness in this place of retirement may be set down as a silly invention, for Rome was not a place where licentiousness was hated. He took up his residence (27) in the island of Capreae, at a short distance from the Campanian coast. The death of Livia (29), the emperor's mother, released Tiberius from one cause of anxiety. He had long been tired of her, because she wished to exercise authority, and one object in leaving Rome was to be out of her way. Livia's death gave Seianus and Tiberius free scope, for Tiberius never entirely released himself from a kind of subjection to his mother, and Seianus did not venture to attempt the overthrow of Livia's influence. The destruction of Agrippina and her children was now the chief purpose of Seianus; but he finally got from Tiberius (31) the reward that was his just desert, an ignominious death. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossseianus">Seianus</ref>.) The death of Seianus was followed by the execution of his friends; and for the remainder of the reign of Tiberius, Rome continued to be the scene of tragic occurrences. Tiberius died on the 16th of March, 37, at the villa of Lucullus, in Misenum. He was seventy-eight years of age, and had reigned twenty-two years. He was succeeded by Gaius (Caligula), the son of Germanicus, but, according to Tacitus, he had himself appointed no successor ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 6. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>vi. 46</bibl>), though he had appointed Gaius the heir of his private property ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>76</bibl>) in conjunction with Tiberius Gemellus, whom Gaius afterwards put to death. On the other hand, Iosephus has a story of Tiberius committing the Empire to Gaius ( <bibl n="Fro. Ant. 18. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>xviii. 6</bibl><bibl n="Fro. Ant. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> Ant., 9</bibl>). Tiberius did not die a natural death. It was <cb /> known that his end was rapidly approaching, and having had a fainting-fit, he was supposed to be dead. Thereupon Gaius came forth and was saluted as emperor; but he was alarmed by the intelligence that Tiberius had recovered and called for something to eat. Gaius was so frightened that he did not know what to do; but Macro, the prefect of the Praetorians, with more presence of mind, gave orders that a quantity of clothes should be thrown on Tiberius, and that he should be left alone ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 5. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>v. 50</bibl>; Dio Cass. lviii. 28). Suetonius mentions a suspicion that Tiberius was poisoned at the last by Gaius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>73</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Cal. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Cal.</title>12</bibl>). Tiberius wrote a brief commentary of his own life, the only book that the emperor Domitian studied ( <bibl n="Suet.

<head orig="Tibia">Tibia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">αὐλός</foreign>). A pipe, the commonest musical instrument of the Greeks and Romans. It was very frequently a hollow cane, perforated with holes in the proper places. In other instances it was made of some kind of wood, especially box, and was bored with a gimlet. When a single pipe was used by itself, the performer upon it, as well as the instrument, was called <seg lang="la">monaulos.</seg> Among the varieties of the single pipe the most remarkable were the bagpipe, the performer upon which was called <seg lang="la">utricularius</seg> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀσκαύλης</foreign>: and the <foreign lang="greek">αὐλὸς πλάγιος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πλαγίαυλος</foreign>, which, as its name implies, had a mouth-piece inserted into it at right angles. Pan was the reputed inventor of this kind of tibia as well as of the <seg lang="la">fistula</seg> or <hi rend="italic">syrinx.</hi> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssyrinx">Syrinx</ref>.) But among the Greeks and Romans it was much more usual to play on two pipes at the same time. Hence a performance (<seg lang="la">tibicinium</seg>) on this instrument, even when executed by a single person, was called <seg lang="la">canere</seg> or <seg lang="la">cantare tibiis.</seg> This act is exhibited in very numerous works of ancient art, and often in such a way as to make it manifest that the two pipes were perfectly distinct, and not connected, as some have supposed, by a common mouth-piece. The mouth-pieces of the two pipes

 often passed through a <seg lang="la">capistrum.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosscapistrum">Capistrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>Three different kinds of pipes were originally used to produce music in the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes. It appears, also, that to produce the Phrygian mode the pipe had only two holes (<foreign lang="greek">τρυπήματα</foreign>) above and that it terminated in a horn bending upwards. It thus approached to <figure id="fig.01582">
<head orig="Tibiae and Syrinx">Tibiae and Syrinx</head>
</figure> the nature of a trumpet, and produced slow, grave, and solemn tunes. The Lydian mode was much quicker, and more varied and animating. Horace mentions “Lydian pipes” as a proper accompaniment when he is celebrating the praise of ancient heroes. The Lydians themselves used this instrument in leading their troops to battle; and the pipes employed for the purpose are distinguished by Herodotus as “male and female”—i. e. probably bass and treble—corresponding to the ordinary sexual difference in the human voice. The corresponding Latin terms are <seg lang="la">tibia dextra</seg> and <seg lang="la">sinistra:</seg> the respective instruments are supposed to have been so called because the former was more properly held in the right hand and the latter in the left. The <seg lang="la">tibia dextra</seg> was used to lead or commence a piece of music, and the <seg lang="la">sinistra</seg> followed it as an accompaniment. The comedies of Terence having been accompanied by the pipe, the following notices are prefixed to explain the kind of music appropriate to each: <seg lang="la">tibiis paribus</seg>, i. e. with pipes in the same mode; <seg lang="la">tibiis imparibus</seg>, pipes in different modes; <seg lang="la">tibiis duabus dextris</seg>, two pipes of low pitch; <seg lang="la">tibiis paribus dextris et sinistris</seg>, pipes in the same mode, and of both low and high pitch. The use of the pipe among the Greeks and Romans was three-fold—viz. at sacrifices (<seg lang="la">tibiae sacrificae</seg>), entertainments (<hi rend="italic">ludicrae</hi>), and funerals. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfunus">Funus</ref>.) The pipe was not confined anciently to the male sex, but <foreign lang="greek">αὐλητρίδες</foreign>, or female <seg lang="la">tibicines</seg>, were very common.

<div2 id="crosstibullus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Tibullus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Albius</foreName>
 <p>, a Roman elegiac poet of equestrian family. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he died young, soon after Vergil. His birth is therefore placed by conjecture B.C. 54, and his death B.C. 19. Of his youth and education absolutely nothing is known. The estate belonging to the equestrian ancestors of Tibullus was at Pedum, between Tibur and Praenesté. This property, like that of the other great poets of the day, Vergil and Horace, had been either entirely or partially confiscated during the Civil Wars; yet Tibullus retained or recovered part of it, perhaps through Messalla, and spent there the better portion of his short, but peaceful and happy, life ( <bibl n="Tib.  1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Tib.i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Tib.  19" default="NO" valid="yes">Tib., 19</bibl>; cf.  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 4</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 7</bibl>). When his friend and patron, Messalla, was going to his prefecture in Asia, B.C. 30, Tibullus, after first refusing, eventually agreed to accompany him, but fell ill on the way at Corcyra and returned thence to Rome ( <bibl n="Tib.  1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Tib.i. 1</bibl>; i. 3). Afterwards, in 28, he went to Aquitania with Messalla, who had been sent by Augustus to suppress a formidable insurrection which had broken out in this province. Part of the glory of the Aquitanian campaign, which Tibullus celebrates in language of unwonted loftiness, redounds, according to the poet, to his own fame. He was present at the battle of Atax (Aude in Languedoc), which quelled the Aquitanian rebellion ( <bibl n="Tib.  1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Tib.i. 7</bibl>). So ceased the active life of Tibullus; his remaining history is the chronicle of his poetry and of the loves which inspired it. The first object of his attachment is celebrated under the poetic name of Delia: according to Apuleius ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>10</bibl>) her real name was Plania. To Delia are addressed the first six elegies of the first book. The poet's attachment to Delia had begun before he left Rome for Aquitania. But Delia seems to have been faithless during his absence from Rome. On his return from Corcyra he found her ill, and attended her with affectionate solicitude ( <bibl n="Cic. Eleg. 1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Eleg.</title>i. 5</bibl>), and hoped to induce her to retire with him into the country. But first a richer lover appears to have supplanted him with the inconstant Delia, and afterwards there appears a husband in his way. The second book of elegies is chiefly devoted to a new mistress named Nemesis (cf. Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Am. 3. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Am.</title>iii. 9</bibl><bibl n="Ov. Am. 32" default="NO" valid="yes"> Am., 32</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  8. 73" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 73</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 7</bibl>). It is probable, though not certain, that this Nemesis is the same as the Glycera mentioned only by Horace ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 33" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title>i. 33</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> Carm., 2</bibl>), who reproves him for dwelling so long in his plaintive elegies on the “pitiless Glycera.”</p>
 <p>The poetry of his contemporaries shows Tibullus to have been a gentle and singularly amiable man. To Horace especially he was an object of warm attachment. Besides the ode which alludes to his passion for Glycera ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 33</bibl>), the epistle to Tibullus gives the most full and pleasing view of his poetical retreat, and of his character; it is written by a kindred spirit. Horace does homage to that perfect purity of taste which distinguishes the poetry of Tibullus, and he takes pride in the candid but favourable judgment of his own Satires. The time of Tibullus he supposes to be shared between the finishing his exquisite small poems, which were to surpass even those of Cassius of Parma, up to that time the models of this kind of composition, and the enjoyment of the country. Tibullus possessed, according to his friend's notions, all the blessings of life—a competent fortune, favour with the great, fame, health; and he seemed to know how to enjoy all those blessings. 
<pb n="1583" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The first two books alone of the elegies under the name of Tibullus are of undoubted authenticity. The third is the work of another, a very inferior poet, whether Lygdamus be a real or fictitions name. This poet was much younger than Tibullus, for he was born in the year of the battle of Mutina, 43. It is probable that he was a less gifted member of Messalla's literary circle: this connection with the patron of Tibullus might account for his elegies being confused with the genuine poems of Tibullus. The hexameter poem on Messalla, which opens the fourth book, is so inferior that, although a successful elegiac poet may have failed when he attempted epic verse, it cannot readily be ascribed to a writer of the exquisite taste of Tibullus. If it is his, it must be regarded as an early poem written in an imitative manner, when he was under the full influence of the Alexandrian School. The smaller elegies of the fourth book have all the inimitable grace and simplicity <figure id="fig.01583">
<head orig="Villa of Hadrian at Tibur. (Restoration by Bühlmann.)">Villa of Hadrian at Tibur. (Restoration by Buhlmann.)</head>
</figure> of Tibullus. With the exception of the thirteenth (of which some lines are hardly surpassed by Tibullus himself) these poems relate to the love of a certain Sulpicia , a woman of noble birth, for Cerinthus, the real or fictitious name of a beautiful youth. Nor is there any improbability in supposing that Tibullus may have written elegies in the name or by the desire of Sulpicia. If Sulpicia was herself the poetess, she approached nearer to Tibullus than any other writer of elegies. The first book of elegies alone seems to have been published during the author's life, probably soon after the triumph of Messalla (27). The second book probably did not appear till after the death of Tibullus. With it may have been published the elegies of his imitator, perhaps his friend and associate in the society of Messalla, Lygdamus (if that be a real name), i. e. the third book and likewise the fourth, made up of poems belonging, as it were, to this intimate society of Messalla; the <title>Panegyricus Messallae</title> by some unnamed author, which, feeble as it is, seems to be of that age; the poems in the name of Sulpicia , with the concluding one, the thirteenth, a fragment of Tibullus himself.

It became subject to Rome with the other Latin cities on the final subjugation of Latium in B.C. 338. Under the Romans Tibur continued to be a large and flourishing town, since the salubrity and beautiful scenery of the place led many of the most distinguished Roman nobles to build here magnificent villas. Of these the most splendid was the villa of the emperor Hadrian, in the extensive remains of which many valuable specimens of ancient art have been discovered. Here also the celebrated Zenobia lived after adorning the triumph of her conqueror, Aurelian.

His early life was stained by a dreadful deed of blood. We are told that so ardent was his love of liberty that when his brother Timophanes endeavoured to make himself tyrant of their native city, Timoleon murdered him rather than allow him to destroy the liberty of the State. At the request of the Greek cities of Sicily, the Corinthians despatched Timoleon with a small force in B.C. 344 to repel 
<pb n="1585" /><cb />
 the Carthaginians from that island. He obtained possession of Syracuse, and then proceeded to expel the tyrants from the other Greek cities of Sicily, but was interrupted in this undertaking by a formidable invasion of the Carthaginians, who landed at Lilybaeum, in 339, with an immense army, under the command of Hasdrubal and Hamilcar, consisting of 70,000 foot and 10,000 horse. Timoleon could only induce 12,000 men to march with him against the Carthaginians; but with this small force he gained a brilliant victory over the Carthaginians on the river Crimissus (339). The Carthaginians were glad to conclude a treaty with Timoleon in 338, by which the river Halycus was fixed as the boundary of the Carthaginian and Greek dominions in Sicily. Subsequently he expelled almost all the tyrants from the Greek cities in Sicily, and established democracies instead. Timoleon, however, was in reality the ruler of Sicily, for all the States consulted him on every matter of importance; and the wisdom of his rule is attested by the flourishing condition of the island for several years even after his death. He died in 337. His life was written by Plutarch.

The latter purchased two of his pictures, the <title>Aiax</title> and <title>Medea</title>, for the immense sum of eighty Attic talents (nearly $90,000), and dedicated them in the Temple of Venus Genetrix (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

It is held by many critics that Timomachus belonged to the Alexandrine Period of Greek art, and that Pliny was mistaken in supposing that the pictures which Caesar bought were painted in Caesar's time.

<head orig="Timon">Timon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τίμων</foreign>). (1) The son of Timarchus of Phlius, a philosopher of the sect of the Skeptics, who flourished in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, about B.C. 279 and onwards. He first studied philosophy at Megara, under Stilpo, and then returned home and married. He next went to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted. Driven from Elis by straitened circumstances, he spent some time on the Hellespont and the Propontis, and taught at Chalcedon as a sophist with such success that he realized a fortune. He then removed to Athens, where he passed the remainder of his life, with the exception of a short residence at Thebes. He died at the age of almost ninety.</p>
 <p>Timon appears to have been endowed by nature with a powerful and active mind, and with that quick perception of the follies of men which betrays its possessor into a spirit of universal distrust both of men and truths, so as to make him a skeptic in philosophy and a satirist in everything. His agnosticism (to use a modern term) is shown by his saying that man need only know three things—viz. what is the nature of things, how we are related to them, and what we can gain from them; but as our knowledge of things must always be subjective and unreal, we can only live in a state of suspended judgment. He wrote numerous works both in prose and poetry. The most celebrated of his poems were the satiric compositions called <hi rend="italic">silli</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">σίλλοι</foreign>), a word of somewhat doubtful etymology, but which undoubtedly describes metrical compositions of a character at once ludicrous and sarcastic. The invention of this species of poetry is ascribed to Xenophanes <cb /> of Colophon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossxenophanes">Xenophanes</ref>.) The <title>Silli</title> of Timon were in three books, in the first of which he spoke in his own person, and the other two are in the form of a dialogue between the author and Xenophanes of Colophon, in which Timon proposed questions, to which Xenophanes replied at length. The subject was a sarcastic account of the tenets of all philosophers, living and dead—an unbounded field for skepticism and satire. They were in hexameter verse, and from the way in which they are mentioned by the ancient writers, as well as from the few fragments of them which have come down to us, it is evident that they were very admirable productions of their kind ( <bibl n="Diog.  9. 12" default="NO">Diog.

The fragments of his poems are collected by Wölke, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Graecorum Syllis</title> (Warsaw, 1820)</bibl>, and by Paul in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Dissertatio de Sillis</title> (Berlin, 1821)</bibl>.

 <p>(2) The Misanthrope (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ μισάνθρωπος</foreign>), lived in the time of the Peloponnesian War. He was an Athenian, of the demus of Colyttus, and his father's name was Echecratides. In consequence of the ingratitude he experienced and the disappointments he suffered from his early friends and companions, he secluded himself entirely from the world, admitting no one to his society except Alcibiades, in whose reckless and variable disposition he probably found pleasure in tracing and studying an image of the world he had abandoned; and at last he is said to have died in consequence of refusing to suffer a surgeon to come to him and set a broken limb. One of Lucian's pieces bears his name ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 1548" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Av.</title>1548</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristoph.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τιμόθεος</foreign>). (1) A celebrated musician and poet of the later Athenian dithyramb. He was a native of Miletus, and the son of Thersander. He was born B.C. 446, and died in 357, in the ninetieth year of his age. He was at first unfortunate in his professional efforts. Even the Athenians, fond as they were of novelty, were offended at the bold innovations of Timotheus, and hissed his performance. On this occasion it is said that Euripides encouraged Timotheus by the prediction that he would soon have the theatres at his feet. This prediction appears to have been accomplished in the vast popularity which Timotheus afterwards enjoyed. He delighted in the most artificial and intricate forms of musical expression, and he used instrumental music, without a vocal accompaniment, to a greater extent than any previous composer. Perhaps the most important of his innovations, as the means of introducing all the others, was his addition to the number of the strings of the <seg lang="la">cithara</seg>, which he seems to have increased to eleven.</p>
 <p>(2) The son of Conon , the famous general. He was himself a distinguished Athenian soldier. He was first appointed to a public command in B.C. 378; and from this time his name frequently occurs as one of the Athenian generals down to 356. In this year he was associated with Iphicrates, Menestheus, and Chares in the command of the Athenian fleet. In consequence of his failure to relieve Samos he was arraigned in 354, and condemned to the crushing fine of 100 talents (more than $100,000). Being unable to pay the fine, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died shortly after. The Athenians 
<pb n="1586" /><cb />
 subsequently remitted nine-tenths of the penalty, and allowed his son Conon to expend the remainder on the repair of the walls, which the famous Conon had restored. (His life is written by Nepos; see <bibl n="Diod.  15. 81" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xv. 81</bibl><bibl n="Diod.  16. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod., xvi. 7</bibl><bibl n="Diod.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod., 21</bibl>; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crossiphicrates">Iphicrates</ref>).</p>

 <p>(4) A sculptor, whose country is not mentioned, but who belonged to the later Attic school of the time of Scopas and Praxiteles. He was one of the artists who executed the basreliefs which adorned the frieze of the Mausoleum. He is also mentioned as the author of a statue of Asclepius at Troezen and one of Artemis which was at Rome (Pausan. ii. 32, 3; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τειρεσίας</foreign>). A Theban, was one of the most renowed soothsayers in all antiquity. He was blind from his seventh year, but lived to a very old age. The occasion of his blindness and of his prophetic power is variously related. In the war of the Seven against Thebes he declared that Thebes should be victorious if Menoeceus would sacrifice himself; and during the war of the Epigoni, when the Thebans had been defeated, he advised them to commence negotiations of peace, and to avail themselves of the opportunity that would thus be afforded them to take to flight. He himself fled with them (or, according to others, he was carried to Delphi as a captive), but on his way he drank from the well of Tilphusa, and died. Even in the lower world Tiresias was believed to retain the powers of perception, while the souls of other mortals were mere shades, and there also he continued to use his golden staff. The blind seer Tiresias acts so prominent a part in the mythical history of Greece that there is scarcely any event with which he is not connected in some way or other; and this introduction of the seer in so many occurrences, separated by long intervals of time, was facilitated by the belief in his long life.

<div2 id="crosstiryns" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tiryns">Tiryns</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τίρυνς</foreign>). A prehistoric citadel in the Argolic plain, about two and one-half miles north of Nauplia, and one mile from the sea. It occupies the summit of a low hill, about 980 feet long by 330 feet wide, and, in the southern half, 59 feet high above the surrounding plain, or 72 feet above sea level. Here, during a period probably not earlier than the fifteenth century B.C., nor later than the eleventh, was the stronghold of a powerful line of chieftains. Like Mycenae, Tiryns seems to have early fallen under the power of Argos, and in B.C. 468 it was annihilated by Argos, or at least reduced to absolute insignificance. Thorough excavations were carried on in the southern portion 
<pb n="1587" /><cb />
 of the citadel by Dr. Schliemann and Dr. Dörpfeld in 1884 and 1885. The walls of fortification were cleared, and within them the remains of an extensive palace were revealed. The lower (northern) portion of the citadel remains unexcavated.</p>
 <p>The citadel-wall of Tiryns is the classic example of “Cyclopian” masonry of the most primitive type. It is built of huge, irregular blocks of lime<figure id="fig.01587">
<head orig="Citadel of Tiryns.">Citadel of Tiryns.</head>
</figure> stone, many of them eight to ten feet long, three feet thick, and three feet high. These blocks were not fitted to one another, but the interstices were filled with clay and with small stones. In places there is a distinct approach toward an arrangement in horizontal courses. The thickness of the wall at the bottom varies from 16 feet to 28 feet, except in two places, where it is greatly increased in order to receive a system of store-chambers. The height of the existing remains is in places upward of 25 feet. The original height can only be guessed; it has been estimated at 50 feet, on the average, measured outside. The citadel had one, and only one, great entrance. This was on the east side. A broad ramp, so placed that the unshielded side of an attacking force would be exposed to the missiles of the defenders above, led to an opening, without gates, in the wall. What defence existed within this opening to the north is not known. To the south the passage was barred by a strong gate, whose threshold and related posts are still in their places. On the opposite (western) side of the citadel was a postern gate, from which ascended a narrow, winding stairway to the back of the palace; there were also two small gate apertures in the northern part of the citadel. On the east side, at the south end, was a gallery in the wall which furnished the means of communication with a series of rectangular store-chambers. The method of roofing by pushing the successive courses of stones farther and farther inward till they meet, should be noted (compare the “Treasury of Atreus” at Mycenae). This system of chambers with communicating gallery is repeated in the south wall, and there are here remains of the stairway by which access was obtained from the summit of the citadel.</p>
 <p>The palace was contemporaneous with the fortification just described. Its walls, not needing especial strength, were built, in their lower portions, of moderate-sized stones laid in clay mixed with straw, with occasional beams of wood laid lengthwise. In many places the upper portions, beginning about three feet from the ground, consisted of unbaked bricks; in two places the bricks begin from the ground. These walls were protected by a plaster consisting of an undercoat of clay and an outer coat of pure lime. The latter <cb /> was decorated with paintings, of which many fragmentary specimens have been found. Another sort of wall-decoration was found in the vestibule of a hall, extending across the western wall at the bottom. This was an alabaster frieze, sculptured with an elaborate pattern of palmettes, rosettes, etc., and studded with pieces of blue glass, supposed to be the <foreign lang="greek">κύανος</foreign> of Homer. The floors throughout the palace were made of pure lime or of lime mixed with small pebbles. Thresholds were of wood or stone. Columns and antae were of wood. It is not certain whether there was a second story over any part of the building. The ground-plan was as follows: Through a large propylaeum, one passed into an irregular open court, and thence through a second and smaller propylaeum into a rectangular open court (<foreign lang="greek">αὐλή</foreign>) having a floor of lime and pebbles and enclosed on three sides by colonnades. North of this came what was obviously the most important part of the house, consisting of a vestibule, an antechamber, and a rectangular roofed hall (<foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign>). In the centre of this hall was a circular hearth, and around the hearth stood four wooden columns supporting the ceiling. As for the outlying rooms, most of them cannot be precisely designated. One, however, a square chamber approached by a passageway starting from the west side of the antechamber of the men's hall, was certainly a bathroom. Its floor was one gigantic stone, estimated to weigh over twenty tons. A fragment of a terracotta bath-tub was found here.</p>
 <p>The palace of Tiryns corresponds in many important respects with the type of house or palace <figure id="fig.01587.2">
<head orig="Arch at Tiryns.">Arch at Tiryns.</head>
</figure> presupposed in the Homeric poems (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">Domus</ref>). There are, however, some differences, of which the most important concerns the communication between the men's and the women's apartments. This, in the Homeric house, was direct and easy; at Tiryns it was long and circuitous. This and the other differences may be due to difference of locality and date. It must not be forgotten that the fortifications and palace of Tiryns are pre-Homeric.

 <p>(2) An Elean soothsayer, of the family of the Clytiadae. He was assured by the Delphic Oracle that he would be successful in five great conflicts. Supposing this to be a promise of distinction as an athlete, he devoted himself to gymnastic exercises; but the Spartans, understanding the oracle to refer, not to gymnastic, but to military victories, made great offers to Tisamenus to induce him to take with their kings the joint command of their armies. This he refused to do on any terms short of receiving the full franchise of their city, which the Spartans eventually granted. He was present with the Spartans at the battle of Plataea, B.C. 379, which was the first of the five conflicts referred to by the oracle. The second was with the Argives and Tegeans at Tegea; the third, with the Arcadians at Dipaea; the fourth was the Third Messenian War (465-455); and the last was the battle of Tanagra, with the Athenians and their allies, in 457 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 33</bibl>-36).

<head orig="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τισσαφέρνης</foreign>). A famous Persian, who was appointed satrap of Lower Asia in B.C. 414. He espoused the cause of the Spartans in the Peloponnesian War, but he did not give them any effectual assistance, since his policy was not to allow either Spartans or Athenians to gain the supremacy, but to exhaust the strength of both parties by the continuance of the war. His plans, however, were thwarted by the arrival of Cyrus in Asia Minor in 407. This prince supplied the Lacedaemonians with effectual assistance. Tissaphernes and Cyrus were not on good terms; and after the death of Darius they were engaged in continual disputes about the cities in the satrapy of the latter, over which Cyrus claimed dominion. The ambitious views of Cyrus towards the throne at length became manifest to Tissaphernes, who lost no time in repairing to the king with information of the danger. At the battle of Cunaxa, in 401, he was one of the four generals who commanded the army of Artaxerxes, and his troops were the only portion of the left wing that was not put to flight by the Greeks. When the Ten Thousand had begun their retreat Tissaphernes professed his great anxiety to serve them, and promised to conduct them home in safety. In the course of the march he treacherously arrested Clearchus and four of the other generals, who were put to death. After this, Tissaphernes annoyed and harassed the Greeks in their march, without, however, seriously impeding it, till they reached the Carduchian Mountains, at which point he gave up the pursuit. Not long after, Tissaphernes, as a reward for his great services, was invested by the king, in addition to his own satrapy, with all the authority which Cyrus had enjoyed in Western Asia. On his arrival he claimed dominion over the Ionian cities, which applied to Sparta for aid. Their request was granted, and the Spartans carried on war against Tissaphernes with success for some years under the command successively of Thimbron, Dercyllidas, and Agesilaüs (400-395). The continued want of success on the part of Tissaphernes led to grievous complaints against him, <cb /> and the charges were transmitted to court, where they were backed by all the influence of Parysatis, eager for the revenge on the enemy of Cyrus, her favourite son. The result was that Tithraustes was commissioned by the king to put Tissaphernes to death and to succeed him in his government, which was accordingly done (395) (Thucyd. viii.;  <bibl n="Xen.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τιτᾶνες</foreign>, sing. <foreign lang="greek">Τιτάν</foreign>). (1) The sons and daughters of Uranus and Gê or Gaea (Earth), originally dwelling in heaven, whence they are called <foreign lang="greek">Οὐρανίωνες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Οὐρανίδαι</foreign>. They were twelve or thirteen in number who fall generally into pairs, viz., Oceanus and Tethys representing the sea; Hyperion and Theia (sun and moon); Coeus and Phoebe (light or star deities); Creios and Eurybia (deities of strength); Cronus and Rhea (heaven and earth); Themis and Mnemosyné, and Iapetus who was to produce mankind ( <bibl n="Hes.

It is said that Uranus, the first ruler of the world, threw his sons, the Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handed)—Briareus, Cottys, Gyes—and the Cyclopes—Arges, Steropes, and Brontes—into Tartarus. Gaea, indignant at this, produced iron, persuaded the Titans to rise against their father, and gave to Cronus an iron sickle. They did as their mother bade them, with the exception of Oceanus. Cronus, with his sickle, mutilated his father. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossuranus">Uranus</ref>.) From the drops of his blood there sprang the Erinnyes, Alecto, Tisiphoné, and Megaera. The Titans then deposed Uranus, liberated their brothers who had been cast into Tartarus, and raised Cronus to the throne. But Cronus hurled the Cyclopes back into Tartarus, and married his sister Rhea. Having been warned by Gaea and Uranus that he should be dethroned by one of his own children, he swallowed successively his children Hestia, Demeter, Heré, Pluto, and Poseidon. Rhea therefore, when she was pregnant with Zeus, went to Crete, and gave birth to the child in the Dictaean Cave, where he was brought up by the Curetes. When Zeus had grown up he availed himself of the assistance of Thetis, the daughter of Oceanus, who gave to Cronus a potion which caused him to bring up the stone and the children he had swallowed. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscronus">Cronus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosszeus">Zeus</ref>.) United with his brothers and sisters, Zeus now began the contest against Cronus and the ruling Titans. This contest (usually called the <ref type="cross" target="crosstitanomachia">Titanomachia</ref>) was carried on in Thessaly, Cronus and the Titans occupying Mount Othrys, and the sons of Cronus Mount Olympus. It lasted ten years, till at length Gaea promised victory to Zeus if he would deliver the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires from Tartarus. Zeus accordingly slew Campé, who guarded the Cyclopes, and the latter furnished him with thunder and lightning. The Titans then were overcome, and hurled down into an abyss below Tartarus, and the Hecatoncheires were set to guard them ( <bibl n="Hes. Th. 617" default="NO" valid="yes">Hes. <title>Th.</title>617</bibl><bibl n="Hes. Th. 697" default="NO" valid="yes">Hes. Th., 697</bibl><bibl n="Hes. Th. 851" default="NO" valid="yes">Hes.

(See <ref type="cross" target="crossgigantes">Gigantes</ref>.)</p>
 <p>The myth of the Titans grew out of an attempt to reconcile the Greek religion with that of other non-Greek nations who had occupied the Greek lands before them. Hence many of its features, especially the account of the wounding of Uranus, 
<pb n="1589" /><cb />
 are not of a Greek character, and are ignored by Homer, but preserved by Hesiod. The Titan dynasties represent primitive alien supreme deities who have been brought into connection with the supreme Zeus of the Greeks and the other Olympian deities. In the Greek conception of the story, the Titans express the more terrible forces of nature, and also the struggle against the will of Zeus—<seg lang="la">i. e.</seg> against the lawful and orderly course of things (cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8. 478" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>viii. 478</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 14. 200" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., xiv. 200</bibl><bibl n="Hom.

 <p>(2) The name Titanes is also given to those divine or semi-divine beings who were descended from the Titans, such as Prometheus, Hecaté, Latona, Pyrrha, and especially Helios (the Sun) and Selené (the Moon), as the children of Hyperion and Thia, and even the descendants of Helios, such as Circé.

<head orig="Titus Flavius Sabīnus Vespasiānus">Titus Flavius Sabinus Vespasianus</head>

 <p> A Roman emperor, A.D. 79-81, commonly called by his praenomen <hi rend="bold">Titus.</hi> He was the son of the emperor Vespasianus and his wife Flavia Domitilla. He was born on the 30th of December, A.D. 40. When a young man, he served as military tribune in Britain and in Germany with great credit. After having been quaestor, he had the command of a legion, and served under his father in the Jewish Wars. Vespasian returned to Italy, after he had been proclaimed emperor on the first of July, A.D. 69; but Titus remained in Palestine to prosecute the siege of Jerusalem, during which he showed the talents of a general with the daring of a soldier. The siege of Jerusalem was concluded by the capture of the place on the 8th of September, 70. Titus returned to Italy in the following year (71), and triumphed at Rome with his father. He also received the title of Caesar, and became the associate of Vespasian in the government. His conduct at this time gave no good promise, and his attach<figure id="fig.01589.2">

</figure> ment to Berenicé, the sister of Agrippa II., also made him unpopular; but he sent her away from Rome after he became emperor. Titus succeeded his father in 79, and his government proved an agreeable surprise to those who had anticipated a return of the times of Nero. During his whole reign Titus displayed a sincere desire for the happiness of the people, and he did all that he could to relieve them in times of distress. He assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus after the death of his father, and with the purpose, as he declared, of keeping his hands free from blood, a resolution which he kept. The first year of his reign is memorable for the great eruption of Vesuvius, which desolated a large part of the adjacent country, and buried with lava and ashes the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Titus endeavoured to repair the ravages of this great eruption; and he was 
<pb n="1590" /><cb />
 also at great care and expense in repairing the damage done by a great fire at Rome, which lasted three days and nights. He completed the Colosseum, and erected the baths which were called by his name. He died on the 13th of September, A.D. 81, after a reign of two years, two months, and twenty days. He was in the 41st year of his age; and there were suspicions that he was poisoned by his brother, Domitian.

<head orig="Toga">Toga</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τήβεννα</foreign>). The distinctive garb of the Roman citizen when appearing in public (see illustrations). Its use was forbidden to exiles and to foreigners; it was indispensable on all official occasions, even in imperial times, when more convenient garments had been adopted for ordinary use. It consisted of a white woollen cloth of semicircular cut, about five yards long by four wide, <figure id="fig.01590">
<head orig="Ancient Mode of Wearing the Toga. (Dresden.)">Ancient Mode of Wearing the Toga. (Dresden.)</head>
</figure> a certain portion of which was pressed by the fuller into long, narrow plaits. This cloth was doubled lengthwise, not down the centre, but so that one fold was deeper than the other. It was next thrown over the left shoulder in such a manner that the end in front reached to the ground, and the part behind was about twice a man's height in length. This end was then brought round under the right arm, and again thrown over the left shoulder so as to cover the whole of the right side from the arm-pit to the calf. The broad folds in which it hung over were thus gathered together on the left shoulder. The part which crossed the breast diagonally was known <cb /> as the <seg lang="la">sinus</seg>, or bosom. It was deep enough to serve as a pocket for the reception of small articles.</p>
 <p>In earlier times the Romans wore the <seg lang="la">toga</seg> even in warfare, although one of considerably less width. It was worn on such occasions in a peculiar mode called the <title>cinctus Gabinus</title>, or girding in the Gabian manner, after the town Gabii. In this, the end which, in the other mode, was thrown over the left shoulder, was drawn tightly round the body, so <figure id="fig.01590.2"><head>Later Mode of Wearing the Toga. (<title>Museo Borbonico.</title>) </head></figure> that in itself it formed a girdle, leaving both arms free and preventing the garment from falling off. This garb was subsequently retained only for certain ceremonial rites, as at the founding of towns, at the Ambarvalia, during incantations, at the opening of the Temple of Ianus, and at sacrificial observances of diverse kinds. After the <seg lang="la">sagum</seg> (q. v.) had been introduced as a military garment, the toga served as the exclusive garb and symbol of peace. Women also in olden times used to wear the toga afterwards this was only the case with prostitutes; and disgraced wives were forbidden to wear the <seg lang="la">stola</seg>, the matron's dress of honour. The colour of the toga, as worn by men (<seg lang="la">toga virilis</seg>), was white: a dark-coloured toga (brown or black, <seg lang="la">toga pulla</seg> or <seg lang="la">sordida</seg>) was worn only by the lower classes, or in time of mourning, or by accused persons. A purple stripe woven in the garment was the distinctive mark of the curule magistrates and censors, of the State priests (but only when performing their functions), and afterwards of the emperors. This, which was called the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, was also worn by boys until they attained manhood, and by girls until marriage. The <seg lang="la">toga picta</seg> was a robe adorned with golden stars; it was worn by a general on his triumph, by the magistrate who was giving public games, in imperial times by consuls on entering office, and by the emperor on festal occasions.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βάσανος</foreign>). Torture. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. —By a decree of Scamandrius of uncertain date 
<pb n="1592" /><cb />
 it was ordained that no free Athenian could be put to the torture ( <title>De Myst.</title> 43), and this appears to have been the general rule. The evidence of slaves was, however, always taken with torture, and their testimony was not otherwise received. From this circumstance their testimony appears to have been considered of more value than that of freemen. Any person might offer his own slave to be examined by torture, or demand that of his adversary, and the offer or demand was equally called <foreign lang="greek">πρόκλησις εἰς βάσανον</foreign>, “challenge to torture.” The parties interested either superintended the torture themselves, or chose certain persons for this purpose, hence called <foreign lang="greek">βασανισταί</foreign>, who took the evidence of the slaves. The official torturer was called <foreign lang="greek">δήμιος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δημόκοινος</foreign>.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>.— During the time of the Republic, freemen were never put to the torture, and slaves only were exposed to this punishment, which might be by scourging, laceration with hooks, or burning. Slaves, however, could not be tortured to prove the guilt of their own master, except in the case of <seg lang="la">incestum</seg>, which was a crime against the gods, or unless the Senate made an exception in some special instance. At a later time, slaves might be tortured to bear witness against their masters in cases of <seg lang="la">maiestas</seg> and adultery. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossadulterium">Adulterium</ref>.) Under the emperors even free persons were put to the torture to extract evidence from them in cases of <seg lang="la">maiestas;</seg> and although this indignity was confined for the most part to persons in humble circumstances, we read of cases in which even Roman senators and knights were exposed to it.

<head orig="Tormentum">Tormentum</head>

 <p> A military engine for hurling missiles of any kind. All the missiles used in war, except those thrown from the sling (see <ref type="cross" target="crossfunda">Funda</ref>), were projected either by the hand alone or with the aid of elastic substances. Of elastic instruments, the bow (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarcus">Arcus</ref>) was used by all ancient nations. The <seg lang="la">tormentum</seg> was so called from the twisting (<seg lang="la">torquendo</seg>) of hairs, thongs, and vegetable fibres; and the word is often used by itself to denote engines of various kinds; often, also, these engines are specified separately under the names of <seg lang="la">ballistae</seg> and <seg lang="la">catapultae</seg>, which names, however, most commonly occur together in the accounts of sieges and other military operations, because the two kinds of engines denoted by them were almost always used in conjunction. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshelepolis">Helepolis</ref>.) The <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">πετροβόλος</foreign>) was used to shoot stones, the <seg lang="la">catapulta</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">καταπέλτης, καταπελτική</foreign>) to project darts, especially the <seg lang="la">falarica</seg> (q. v.), and a kind of missile four and a half feet long, called <hi rend="italic">trifax.</hi> While, in besieging a city, the ram (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaries">Aries</ref>) was employed in destroying the lower part of the wall, the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> was used to overthrow the battlements (<seg lang="la">propugnacula</seg>), and the catapult to shoot any of the besieged who appeared between them. The forms of these machines being adapted to the objects which they were intended to throw, the catapult was long, the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> nearly square, which explains the following humorous enumeration by Plautus ( <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 4. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Capt.</title>iv. 2</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Capt. 16" default="NO" valid="yes"> Capt., 16</bibl>) of the three <foreign lang="greek">μηχαναί</foreign>, the application of which has just been explained: <cb /> <lb />“Meus est ballista pugnus, cubitus catapulta est mihi, <lb />Humerus aries.”</p>
 <p>In the same armament the number of catapults was commonly much greater than the number of <seg lang="la">ballistae.</seg> Also, these two classes of machines were both of them distinguished into the greater and the less, the number of “the less” being much more considerable than the number of “the greater.” When Carthago Nova, which had served the Carthaginians for an arsenal, was taken by the Romans, the following were found in it: 120 large and 281 small catapults; 23 large and 52 small <seg lang="la">ballistae.</seg> Three sizes of the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> are mentioned <figure id="fig.01592">
<head orig="Ballista. (Baumeister.)">Ballista. (Baumeister.)</head>

Besides these, Vitruvius (x. 11) mentions many other sizes, even down to the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> which threw a stone of only two pounds' weight. In like manner, catapults were classified according to the length of the arrows shot from them. According to Iosephus, who gives some remarkable instances of the destructive force of the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg>, it threw stones to the distance of a quarter of a mile (<title>Bell. Iud.</title> iii. 7, 19-23). Neither from the best-known authors nor from the figures on the Column of Trajan are we able to form a very exact idea of the construction of these engines. Still less are we informed on the subject of the <seg lang="la">scorpio</seg> or <hi rend="italic">onager</hi>, which was also a <hi rend="italic">tor-</hi> <figure id="fig.01592.2">

</figure> <seg lang="la">mentum.</seg> The best notion of ancient artillery is to be gathered from the treatise of Hero (<foreign lang="greek">Βελοποιϊκά</foreign>), 
<pb n="1593" /><cb />
 and that of Philo (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Βελοποιϊκῶν</foreign>), both written in the second or third century B.C.</p>
 <p>The various kinds of <seg lang="la">tormenta</seg> appear to have been invented shortly before the time of Alexander the Great. When horsehair and other materials failed, the women in several instances cut off their own hair, and twisted it into ropes for the engines. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspunic-wars">Punic Wars</ref>.) These machines, with those who had the management of them, and who were called <seg lang="la">ballistarii</seg> and <foreign lang="greek">ἀφεταί</foreign>, were drawn up in the rear of an advancing army, so as to throw over the heads of the front ranks. In order to attack a maritime city, they were carried on the decks of vessels constructed for the purpose ( <bibl n="Diod.  20. 83" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xx. 83</bibl>-86).</p>
 <p>Both of the chief varieties of <seg lang="la">tormenta</seg> were based upon the principle of the crossbow; but the elasticity of the bow was exchanged for elasticity in the twist of the cord. Consequently, as explained above, all pieces of heavy artillery were called by the Romans <seg lang="la">tormenta.</seg> The machine consisted of three parts: the stand, the groove for the shot, and the apparatus representing the bow. This consisted of a frame in three divisions, through the midmost of which passed the groove for the shot. In each of the lateral divisions was stretched, in a vertical direction, a set of strong elastic cords, made of the sinews of animals, or the long hair of animals or of women. These were stretched tight, and between each of them was fixed a straight unelastic arm of wood. The arms were joined by a cord, which was pulled back by a winch applied at the end of the groove. On letting this go, the arms, and with them the string and the object in front of it, were driven forward by the twisting of the vertical cords. The effectiveness of the engine thus depended on the <figure id="fig.01593">
<head orig="Catapulta.">Catapulta.</head>
</figure> power and twist of the cords, which may be said roughly to express its calibre. The engines were divided into two kinds, (1) <seg lang="la">catapultae</seg>, or <hi rend="italic">scorpiones.</hi> In these the groove for the shot was horizontal, and they projected missiles of length and thickness varying according to the calibre;</p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">ballistae</seg>, which shot stones, beams, or balls up to 162 lbs. weight, at an angle of 50 degrees. The <cb /> calibre of the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> was at least three times as great as that of the catapult. The average range of the catapult was about 383 yards, that of the <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> from about 295 to 503 yards.</p>
 <p>After Constantine we hear no more of catapults, but only of <seg lang="la">ballistae</seg> and the <hi rend="italic">onager.</hi> The <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> now shot arrows, and is described either as a huge cross-bow with an elastic bow of iron, or as virtually identical with the old catapult. The <hi rend="italic">onager</hi>, also called <seg lang="la">scorpio</seg>, was a sling for stones, consisting of a frame in which was fastened a sort of wooden arm with a sling at one end.</p>
 <p>As a rule, the heavy artillery was employed only in sieges; but artillery accompanied armies in the field for purposes of conquest or defence. The legions and the cohorts of the Praetorian Guard had their own artillery, and at the end of the fourth century every <seg lang="la">centuria</seg> in the legion had a <seg lang="la">ballista</seg> of the later kind drawn on wheels by mules (<seg lang="la">carroballista</seg>), and served by eleven men. Every cohort had an <hi rend="italic">onager</hi>, carried on a cart drawn by two oxen. See the article by A. Müller in Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler</title>, s. v. “Festungskrieg und Belagerungswesen,” i. pp. 525 foll.; Droysen, <title>Die griechischen Kriegsalterthümer</title>, pp. 187-204; <bibl default="NO">Wescher, <title>Poliorcétique des Grecs</title> (1867)</bibl>; and Rüstow and <bibl default="NO">Köchly, <title>Geschichte des griechischen Kriegswesens</title> (1852)</bibl>.

 <p> The name of a patrician family of the Manlia gens. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">T. Manlius Imperiōsus. Torquātus</hi>, the son of L. Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus, dictator B.C. 363, was a favourite hero of Roman story. Manlius is said to have been dull of mind in his youth, and was brought up by his father in the closest retirement in the country. In 361 he served under the dictator T. Quintius Pennus in the war against the Gauls, and in this campaign earned immortal glory by slaying in single combat a gigantic Gaul. From the dead body of the barbarian he took the chain (<seg lang="la">torques</seg>) which had adorned him, and placed it around his own neck; and from this circumstance he obtained the surname of Torquatus. He was dictator in 353, and again in 349. He was also three times consul, namely, in 347, 344, and in 340. In the last of these years Torquatus and his colleague, P. Decius Mus, gained the great victory over the Latins at the foot of Vesuvius, which established forever the supremacy of Rome over Latium. Shortly before the battle, when the two armies were encamped opposite to one another, the consuls published a proclamation that no Roman should engage in single combat with a Latin on pain of death. This command was violated by young Manlius, the consul's son, who was in consequence executed by the lictor in presence of the assembled army. This severe sentence rendered Torquatus an object of detestation among the Roman youths 
<pb n="1594" /><cb />
 as long as he lived; and the recollection of his severity was preserved in after-ages by the expression <title>Manliana imperia</title> (<bibl n="Liv.  4. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iv. 5</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  19" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 19</bibl>-28; id. viii. 3-12; <title>De Off.</title> iii. 31).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">T. Manlius Torquātus</hi>, consul B.C. 235, when he conquered the Sardinians; censor in 231; and consul a second time in 224. He possessed the hereditary sternness and severity of his family; and we accordingly find him opposing in the Senate the ransom of those Romans who had been taken prisoners at the fatal battle of Cannae. He was dictator in 210.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Manlius Torquātus</hi>, consul B.C. 65 with L. Aurelius Cotta. He took an active part in suppressing the Catilinarian conspiracy in 63; and he also supported Cicero when he was banished in 58.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Manlius Torquātus</hi>, son of No. 3, belonged to the aristocratic party, and accordingly opposed Caesar on the breaking out of the Civil War in 49. He was praetor in that year, and was stationed at Alba with six cohorts. He subsequently joined Pompey in Greece, and in the following year (48) he had the command of Oricum intrusted to him; but was obliged to surrender both himself and the town to Caesar, who, however, dismissed Torquatus uninjured. After the battle of Pharsalia, Torquatus went to Africa, and upon the defeat of his party in that country in 46 he attempted to escape to Spain along with Scipio and others, but was taken prisoner by P. Sittius at Hippo Regius, and slain, together with his companions. Torquatus was well acquainted with Greek literature, and is praised by Cicero, with whom in early life he was closely connected, as a man well trained in every kind of learning.</p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">A. Manlius Torquātus</hi>, praetor in B.C. 52, when he presided at the trial of Milo for bribery. On the breaking out of the Civil War he espoused the side of Pompey, and after the defeat of the latter retired to Athens, where he was living in exile in 45. He was an intimate friend of Cicero.

<head orig="Tragoedia">Tragoedia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τραγῳδία</foreign>). I. Tragedy in <ref type="cross" target="crossgreece">Greece</ref> originated in the lyric dithyramb; i. e. in the song of a chorus at the rites held in honour of Dionysus (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>). This song, in accordance with the cult of the god, expressed at one time exuberant joy, at another deep sorrow. The cult of Dionysus is also indicated by the very name of tragedy, signifying goat-song; i. e. (according to the usual explanation) the hymn sung by the chorus in their dance round the altar at the sacrifice of the goat (<foreign lang="greek">τράγος</foreign>), dedicated to Dionysus. Others derive the name from the fact that, to represent Satyrs, the chorus were clad in goat-skins, and hence resembled goats. These choral songs seem to have received a certain dramatic form as early as the time of Arion , to whom the dithyramb owes its artistic development. The true drama, including tragic and satyric plays, was evolved subsequently in Athens.</p>
 <p>Tradition ascribes the origin of tragedy to a contemporary of Solon named <ref type="cross" target="crossthespis">Thespis</ref> (q.v.), of Icaria, which was a chief seat of the cult of Dionysus. The date assigned to this is B.C. 540. Thespis was at the same time poet, leader of the chorus, and actor. According to the testimony of the ancients, his pieces consisted of a prologue, a series of choral songs standing in close connection with the action, and dramatic recitations introduced between the choruses. These recitations were delivered by the leader of the chorus, and were partly in the form of monologues, partly in that of short dialogues with the chorus, whereby the action of the play was advanced. The reciter was enabled to appear in different rôles by the aid of linen or wooden masks, which are also said to have been introduced by the poet himself. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspersona">Persona</ref>.) The invention of Thespis , whose own pieces soon lapsed into oblivion, won the favour of Pisistratus and the approval of the Athenian public. Tragedy 
<pb n="1595" /><cb />
 thus became an important element in the Attic festival of Dionysus. Thespis's immediate followers were Choerilus, Pratinas (the inventor of the Satyric Drama), his son Aristias , and Phrynichus. Phrynichus especially did good service towards the development of tragedy by introducing an actor apart from the leader of the chorus, and so preparing the way for true dialogue. He further improved the chorus, which still, however, occupied a disproportionate space in comparison with the action of the play.</p>
 <p>Tragedy was really brought into being by Aeschylus, when he added a second actor (called the <foreign lang="greek">δευτεραγωνιστής</foreign>) to the first, or <foreign lang="greek">πρωταγωνιστής</foreign>, and in this way rendered dialogue possible. He further subordinated the choruses to the dialogue. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaeschylus">Aeschylus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Sophocles, in whom tragedy reaches its culminating-point, added to Aeschylus's two actors a third, or <foreign lang="greek">τριταγωνιστής</foreign>: and Aeschylus accepted the innovation in his later plays. Thenceforward three actors were regularly granted by lot to each poet, at the public expense. Only rarely, and in exceptional cases, was a fourth employed. Sophocles also raised the number of the chorus from twelve to fifteen. The only other important innovation due to him was that he gave up the internal connection, preserved by Aeschylus, among the several plays of a tetralogy which were presented in competition by the tragic poets at the festival of Dionysus. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssophocles">Sophocles</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstetralogia">Tetralogia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstrilogia">Trilogia</ref>.</p>
 <p>The third great master of tragedy is Euripides, in whom, however, we already observe a decline in many respects from the severe standard of his predecessor (see <ref type="cross" target="crosseuripides">Euripides</ref>). During and after the age of these masters of the art, from whom alone have complete dramas come down to us, many other tragic poets were actively employed, whose works are known to us by name alone, or are only preserved in fragments.</p>
 <p>It is remarkable that, in the case of the great tragic writers, the cultivation of tragic compositions seems to have been hereditary among their descendants, and among those of Aeschylus in particular, for many generations. His son Euphorion, his nephew Philocles, his grand-nephews Morsimus and Melanthius, his grandson Astydamas, and his great-grandsons Astydamas and Philocles, were poets of more or less note. In the family of Sophocles may be mentioned his son Iophon and his grandson Sophocles; and in that of Euripides, his son or nephew of the same name.</p>
 <p>Among the other poets of the fifth century B.C., Ion, Achaeus, Aristarchus, and Neophron were accounted the most eminent. Agathon may also be included as the first who ventured to treat a subject of his own invention, whereas hitherto mythical history, especially that of Homer and the <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclic-poets">Cyclic Poets</ref> (q.v.), or, in rare instances, authentic history, had furnished the materials of the play. After the Peloponnesian War, tragedy shared the general and ever-increasing decline of political and religious vitality. In the fourth century, besides the descendants of Aeschylus, we must mention Theodectes, Aphareus, and Chaeremon, who partly wrote for readers only.</p>
 <p>The number of tragedies produced at Athens is marvellous. According to the not altogether trustworthy records of the number of plays written by each poet, they amounted to 1400. The works of <cb /> the foremost poets were represented over and over again, especially in the theatres of Asia Minor, under the successors of Alexander. During the first half of the third century Ptolemy Philadelphus built a great theatre in Alexandria, where he established competitions in exact imitation of those at Athens. This gave a new impetus to tragic poetry, and seven poets became conspicuous, who were known as the Alexandrian Pleiad, Alexander Aetolus, Philiscus, Sositheus, Homerus, Aeantides, Sosiphanes, and Lycophron. The taste of the Alexandrian critics deemed them worthy to occupy a place beside the five great tragic poets of Athens, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ion, and Achaeus. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanon-alexandrinus">Canon Alexandrinus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspleias">Pleias</ref>.</p>
 <p>Inasmuch as tragedy developed itself out of the chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, so, in spite of all the limitations which were introduced as a result of the evolution of the true drama, the chorus itself was always retained. Hence Greek tragedy consisted of two elements: the one truly dramatic, the prevailing metre of which was the iambic trimeter; the other consisting of song and dance (see <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref>) in the numerous varieties of Dorian lyric poetry. The dramatic portion was generally made up of the following parts: the <foreign lang="greek">πρόλογος</foreign>, from the beginning to the first entry of the chorus; the <foreign lang="greek">ἐπεισώδιον</foreign>, the division between each choral song and the next; and the <foreign lang="greek">ἔξοδος</foreign>, or concluding portion which followed the last chorus. The first important choral part was called the <foreign lang="greek">πάροδος</foreign>: and the song following an <hi rend="italic">episodium</hi>, a <foreign lang="greek">στάσιμον</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">μέλος</foreign>). There were further songs of lamentation by the chorus and actors together, which were called <foreign lang="greek">κόμμοι</foreign>. A solo was sometimes sung by the actor alone; and this became especially common in the later tragedies.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi> tragedy was founded entirely on that of the Greeks. In early times there existed crude dramatic productions (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssatira">Satira</ref>), which provided an opening for the translation from the Greek dramas brought on the stage by Livius Andronicus. He was a Greek by birth, but was brought to Rome as a captive about B.C. 200. It is to him that Roman tragedy owes its origin. His dramas and those of his successors were more or less free versions of Greek originals. Even the tragedies, or historical plays, drawn from national Roman materials, called <seg lang="la">fabulae praetextae</seg> or <seg lang="la">praetextatae</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crosspraetexta">Praetexta</ref>), the first writer of which was his immediate successor Naevius (about B.C. 235), were entirely modelled on the Greek. The most noteworthy representatives of tragedy under the Republic were Ennius (B.C. 239-170), Pacuvius (220- 130), and Attius (170-84), besides whom only a few other poets produced any works about this time. It is true that the scanty fragments we possess of these dramas admit of no positive judgment as to their merit, but there is no doubt that they rank far below the original creations of the Greeks. It may also be clearly inferred from the fragments that declamation and pathos formed a characteristic attribute of Roman tragedy, which was intensified by a studied archaism of expression. Moreover, the titles of their plays that have come down to us show that preference was given to subjects relating to the Trojan epic cycle; this is to be explained by the Trojan origin claimed by the Romans. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.) Next to this the most popular were the myths of the Pelopidae, of the Theban cycle, and of the Argonauts. Euripides 
<pb n="1596" /><cb />
 was the favourite model; after him Sophocles; rarely Aeschylus. Roman tragedy, like Greek, was made up of spoken dialogue in iambic trimeters and musical portions called <seg lang="la">cantica.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanticum">Canticum</ref>, and on the chorus in Roman tragedy see <ref type="cross" target="crosschorus">Chorus</ref> (near the end).</p>
 <p>In the time of Augustus the representatives of tragedy were Asinius Pollio, Varius, and Ovid; under Tiberius, Pomponius Secundus; under Nero and Vespasian, Curiatius Maternus, of whose works scarcely a line has been preserved. The only tragedies of Roman antiquity which we possess are those of the philosopher Seneca, which show great mastery of form and a fertile imagination, but suffer from an intolerable excess of rhetorical declamation. It is doubtful whether they were intended for the stage at all, and not rather for public recitation and for private reading. See <ref type="cross" target="crossseneca">Seneca</ref></p>

 <p>A Roman emperor (A.D. 98-117), born at Italica, near Seville, in Spain, September 18th, A.D. 52 or 53. He was trained to arms, and, after ten years' service as military tribune, rose through the lower offices to the rank of praetor in 85, served with distinction in the East and in Germany, to which country he was sent from Spain by Domitian on the occasion of the revolt of Antonius Saturninus, legatus, with the Spanish legion Adiutrix under his command. He was consul in 91, and at the close of 97 he was adopted by the emperor Nerva , who gave him the rank of Caesar and the names of Nerva and Germanicus, and shortly after the title of Imperator, and the <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas.</seg> His style and title after his elevation to the imperial dignity were <hi rend="SmallCaps">Imperātor Caesar Traiānus Augustus</hi>. He was the first Roman emperor who was born out of Italy. Nerva died in January, 98, and was succeeded by Trajan, who was then at Colonia (Cologne). His accession was hailed with joy, and he did not disappoint the expectations of the people. He was a great soldier both in the field and in military organization; and he was scarely less great as an administrator. His finances were prosperous, partly from his good economy, though partly also from the good fortune <cb /> of certain Dacian mining operations. Personally, he was strong and healthy, of a majestic appearance, laborious, and inured to fatigue. Though not a man of letters, he had good sense, a knowledge of the world, and a sound judgment. His mode of living was very simple, and in campaigns he shared all the sufferings and privations of the soldiers, by whom he was both loved and feared. He was a friend to justice, and had a sincere desire for the happiness of the people. His career led to a proverbial expression which after this time was formulated in a wish to each new emperor that in his reign he might be even “more fortunate than Augustus, and better than Trajan” (<title>Augusto felicior, melior Traiano</title>).</p>
 <p>Trajan did not return to Rome for some months, being employed in settling the frontiers on the Rhine and the Danube. Especially, he completed the fortifications of the Rhine and of the <ref type="cross" target="crossagri-decumates">Agri Decumates</ref> (q.v.), founded a new military station, Colonia Traiana, near Vetera, and constructed new roads by the Rhine and by the Danube, the latter work in preparation for the Dacian War. In 99 he proceeded to Rome, which he entered on foot, ac<figure id="fig.01596">
<head orig="Trajan. (Bust in the British Museum.)">Trajan. (Bust in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure> companied by his wife, Pompeia Plotina. In March, A.D. 101, Trajan left Rome for his campaign against the Daci. Decebalus, king of the Daci, had compelled Domitian to purchase peace by an annual payment of money; and Trajan determined on hostilities, which should settle matters so as to secure the peace of the frontier. This war employed Trajan between two and three years, but it ended with the defeat of Decebalus, who sued for peace at the feet of the Roman emperor. Trajan assumed the name of Dacius, and entered Rome in triumph (103). In the following year (104) Trajan commenced his second Dacian war against Decebalus, who had accepted the Roman terms merely to gain time, and now showed his intentions by building forts, collecting war material, and welcoming Roman deserters. <figure id="fig.01597">
<head orig="Trajan giving a King to the Parthians. (Coin.)">Trajan. (Bust in the British Museum.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="1597" /><cb /> Decebalus was completely defeated, and put an end to his life (106). In the course of this war Trajan built (105) a permanent bridge across the Danube at the modern Turn Severin. The piers were of stone and of an enormous size, but the arches were of wood. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspons">Pons</ref>.) After the death of Decebalus, Dacia was reduced to the form of a Roman province, strong forts were built in various places, and Roman colonies were planted. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdacia">Dacia</ref>.) The Column of Trajan at Rome was erected to commemorate his Dacian victories. In its sculptured illustrations of the campaign it has an historical value which has been well compared to that of the Bayeux Tapestry. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna">Columna</ref>.) On his return Trajan had a triumph, and he exhibited games to the people for 123 days. It is said that 11,000 animals were slaughtered during these amusements, and that 10,000 gladiators fought in the arena.</p>
 <p>About this time Arabia Petraea was subjected to the Empire by A. Cornelius Palma, the governor of Syria, and an Indian embassy came to Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossarabia">Arabia</ref>.) The dominions of Agrippa II., who died A.D. 100, were also added to the province of Syria. In 114 Trajan left Rome to make war on the Armenians and the Parthians, the cause of the war being that the Parthian king, Chosroes, had deposed from the throne of Armenia Axidares, the Roman nominee. Trajan spent the winter of 114 at Antioch, and in the following year he invaded the Parthian dominions. The most striking and brilliant success attended his arms. In the course of two campaigns (115-116), he conquered the greater part of the Parthian Empire, and took the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. In 116 he descended the Tigris and entered the Erythraean Sea (Persian Gulf). While he was thus engaged the Parthians rose against the Romans, but were again subdued by the generals of Trajan, Erucius Clarus, who reduced Babylonia and burned Seleucia, and Lucius Quietus, who reduced Mesopotamia. On his return to Ctesiphon, Trajan determined to give the Parthians a king, and placed the diadem on the head of Parthamaspates, son of Chosroes. In 117 Trajan fell ill, and as his complaint grew worse he set out for Italy. He lived to reach Selinus in Cilicia, afterwards called Traianopolis, where he died in August, 117, after a reign of nineteen years, six months, and fifteen days (<title>C. I. L.</title> vi. 1884). His ashes were taken to Rome in a golden urn, carried in triumphal procession, and deposited under the column which bears his name. He left no children, and he was succeeded by Hadrian. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshadrianus">Hadrianus</ref>.) Trajan constructed several great roads in the provinces and in Italy: among them was the road across the Pomptine Marshes, which he constructed with magnificent bridges over the streams. At Ostia he built a large new basin. At Rome he <cb /> constructed the aqueduct called by his name, built a theatre in the Campus Martius, and, above all, made the Forum Traianum, with its basilicas and libraries, and his column in the centre.

Dealers in money; money-changers; usurers; bankers; so called from the “table” (<foreign lang="greek">τράπεζα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">mensa</seg>) on which they did their business.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—Bankers in Greece had their stands in the agora or other public places, and combined in their vocation a number of different pursuits. Thus, they gave change for coins of large denominations, as obols for drachmas; bought foreign money at a discount (<foreign lang="greek">καταλλάττω</foreign>); furnished gold for export, lent money to merchants on the security of ships and cargoes, received money on deposit for which they paid interest, and acted as pawnbrokers, advancing cash on plate, jewels, and other personal property.</p>
 <p>The notion of many Greeks that all taking of interest partook of the nature of usury was shared even by Aristotle ( <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>i. 10</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> Pol., 4</bibl>); yet, while not altogether escaping the reproach which attached to their calling as such, the higher class of bankers in many instances acquired much personal respect, and a high reputation for ability combined with honesty ( <title>Pro Phorm.</title> p. 957. 44); their credit enabled them to raise money at a moment's notice in distant cities (id. <title>Contra Polycl.</title> p. 1224. 56). Such confidence was placed in them that sometimes business was transacted with them 
<pb n="1598" /><cb />
 without witnesses; money and contracts of debt were deposited with them, and agreements were concluded or cancelled in their presence ( <title>Contra Callipp.</title> p. 1242. 24; <title>Contra Dionysod.</title> p. 1287. 15). They thus became a sort of unofficial notaries-public.</p>
 <p>Before the rise of a banking system, the place of banks was to some extent supplied by the temples, which played no unimportant part in early Greek commerce. They were used as safe places for the deposit of treasure; and having large funds of their own, derived from the rent of their estates and from votive offerings, they employed productively both these and the sums confided to their care. Thus Clisthenes and the Alcmaeonidae borrowed from the Delphic sanctuary, with the consent of the Amphictyons, the funds with which the Pisistratidae were overthrown (Isocr. <title>Antid.</title> 232); and at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War the Corinthians proposed to equip a fleet with loans effected at Delphi and Olympia ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 121" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 121</bibl>). It has been thought that the temples confined themselves to State loans, and did not lend money to individuals: Büchsenschütz, however, has shown from the Delian <title>Marmor Sandvicense</title> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossamphictyones">Amphictyones</ref>) and other inscriptions that private persons enjoyed this accommodation. To the undoubted general rule that no banks were either worked or guaranteed by the State, an exception was imagined to exist at Byzantium on the strength of a passage in Aristotle ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 2. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>ii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> Oecon., 4</bibl>); but all that is really stated is that an impoverished government, among other expedients, sold a monopoly of money-changing to a particular bank.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—Bankers are known to have existed in Rome as early as 309 B.C. (<bibl n="Liv.  9. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 40</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  16" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 16</bibl>), and their functions were substantially the same as in Greece. Originally an <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> was a private banker, and a <seg lang="la">nummularius</seg> a State officer, connected with the Mint (see <ref type="cross" target="crossmoneta">Moneta</ref>); but in later Latin both terms as well as <seg lang="la">mensarius, mensularius</seg>, and <seg lang="la">collectarius</seg> are used indiscriminately of any one engaged in the business of lending or changing money.</p>
 <p>The branches of a Roman banker's business were the following: (1) <title>Permutatio</title>, or the exchange of foreign coin for Roman coin, in which case a small commission (<seg lang="la">collybus</seg>) was paid to them ( <title>Verr.</title> iii. 78, 180). In later times, when the Romans became acquainted with the Greek custom of using bills of exchange, the Roman bankers, e. g., received sums of money which had to be paid at Athens, and then drew a bill payable at Athens by some banker in that city (<title>permutare Athenas</title>, <title>Ad Att.</title> xv. 15, 4). This operation was also called <seg lang="la">permutatio.</seg></p>
 <p>(2) The keeping of sums of money for other persons. Such money might be deposited by the owner merely to save himself the trouble of keeping it and making payments, and in this case it was called <seg lang="la">depositum;</seg> the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> then paid no interest, and the money was called <seg lang="la">vacua pecunia.</seg> When a payment was to be made, the owner drew a cheque (Plaut. <title>Curcul.</title> ii. 3, 66, etc.; iii. 66, etc.). Or the money was deposited on condition of the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> paying interest: in this case the money was called <seg lang="la">creditum</seg>, and the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> might of course employ the money himself in any lucrative manner ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 39" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>39</bibl>). In case of failure the law enacted that the claims of <seg lang="la">depositarii</seg> should be satisfied before <cb /> those of creditors who had money at interest in the bank (<title>Dig.</title> xvi. 3, 7, 2). The <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> thus did almost the same sort of business as a modern banker. Many persons intrusted all their capital to them ( <title>Pro Caec.</title> 6, 16); and instances in which the <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg> made payments in the name of those whose money they had in hand are mentioned very frequently. A payment made through a banker was called <seg lang="la">per mensam, de mensa</seg>, or <seg lang="la">per mensae scripturam</seg>, while a payment made by the debtor in person was a payment <seg lang="la">ex arca</seg> or <seg lang="la">de domo.</seg> An <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> never paid away any person's money without receiving a cheque (<seg lang="la">perscriptio</seg>), and the payment was then made either in cash, or, if the person who was to receive it kept an account with the same banker, he had it added in the banker's book to his own deposit. This was likewise called <seg lang="la">perscribere</seg> or simply <seg lang="la">scribere</seg> (Plaut. <bibl n="Luc. Asin. 2. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Asin.</title>ii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Luc. Asin. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> Asin., 34</bibl>, etc.; <title>Curc.</title> v. 2, 20; <title>Ad Att.</title> iv. 18. 2, ix. 12, 3, xii. 51, 3;  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 3" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 76" default="NO"> Sat., 76</bibl>). We also find that <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg> made payments for persons who had not deposited any money with them: this was equivalent to lending money, which in fact they often did for a certain percentage of interest. Of all this business, of the receipts as well as of the expenditure, the <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg> kept accurate accounts in books called <seg lang="la">codices, tabulae</seg>, or <seg lang="la">rationes </seg> (<title>Dig.</title> 2, 13, 1, 1), and there is every reason for believing that they were acquainted with what is called in book-keeping double entry.</p>
 <p>(3) A connection with commerce and public auctions. This branch of their business seems to have been one of the most ancient. In private sales and purchases they sometimes acted as agents for either party (<seg lang="la">interpretes</seg>), and sometimes they undertook to sell the whole estate of a person, as an inheritance. At public auctions they were almost invariably present, registering the articles sold, their prices and purchasers, and receiving the payment from the purchasers. At auctions, however, the <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg> might transact business through their clerks or servants, who were called <seg lang="la">coactores</seg> from their collecting the money. Horace's father and Vespasian's grandfather were <seg lang="la">coactores.</seg> This business, connected with auctions, seems to have belonged exclusively to <seg lang="la">argentarii.</seg></p>
 <p>Banking establishments were often owned by several partners (<seg lang="la">socii</seg>). Slaves were allowed to act as bankers on their own account with their <seg lang="la">peculium</seg>, and the master was liable for the amount of the <seg lang="la">peculium</seg> sunk in the business; but generally the slave was only the manager of the bank (<seg lang="la">institor</seg>) for his master. During imperial times the <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg>, like so many other branches of the community, organized themselves into a <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> (Orelli, 913, 995).</p>
 <p>As regards the respectability of the <seg lang="la">argentarii</seg>, the passages of the ancients seem to contradict one another, for some writers speak of their occupation as respectable and honourable ( <title>Pro Caec.</title> 4, 10); Aurel.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τραπεζοῦς</foreign>). (1) A city of Arcadia, on the Alpheus, the name of which was mythically derived from the <foreign lang="greek">τράπεζα</foreign>, or altar, on which Lycaon was said to have offered human sacrifices to Zeus. At the time of the building of Megalopolis, the inhabitants of Trapezus, as was alleged, rather than be transferred to the new city, migrated to the shores of the Euxine, and their city fell to ruin ( <bibl n="Paus.  8.3.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.viii.3.2</bibl>; <bibl n="Apollod.  3.8.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.8.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 127" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 127</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) Now Tarabosan, Trabezun, or Trebizond); a colony of Sinopé, at almost the extreme east of the northern shore of Asia Minor. The city derived its name either from the table-like plateau on which it was built, or because emigrants from the Arcadian Trapezus took some part in its settlement ( <bibl n="Paus.  13.27.4" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.xiii.27.4</bibl>). The former is the more likely statement, since there is no reason why the main body of colonists from Sinopé should have given it the name of another town. After Sinopé lost its independence, Trapezus belonged, first to Armenia Minor, and afterwards to the kingdom of Pontus. Under the Romans, it was made a free city, probably by Pompey, and, by Trajan, the capital of Pontus Cappadocius. Hadrian constructed a new harbour; and the city became a place of first-rate commercial importance. It was also strongly fortified. It was taken by the Goths in the reign of Valerian; but it had recovered, and was in a flourishing state at the time of Justinian, who repaired its fortifications ( <bibl n="Procop. Aed. 3. 7" default="NO">Procop. <title>Aed.</title>iii. 7</bibl>). In the Middle Ages it was for some time the seat of a fragment of the Greek Empire, called the Empire of Trebizond.

Caesar raised him to the consulship in October, 45, and promised him the province of Asia. In return for all these honours and favours, Trebonius was one of the prime movers in the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar, and after the murder of his patron (44) he went as proconsul to the province of Asia.

 <p> Either ordinary magistrates or officers, or else extraordinary commissioners, who were frequently appointed at Rome to execute any public office. The form <hi rend="italic">triumvir</hi> is quite legitimate, and the gen. plur. is often used as a predicate of a single individual; but it is doubtful whether there is any good authority for the nom. plur. <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi>, although it is often found in our texts: MSS. seem 
<pb n="1600" /><cb />
 always to give <hi rend="italic">iiiviri.</hi> The following is a list of the most important of both classes, arranged in alphabetical order:</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Agro Dividundo</hi>. See <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresviri Coloniae Deducendae</hi> below.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Capitāles</hi> appear to have been regularly appointed first in about B.C. 290 (Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>11</bibl>). At first the tresviri were not chosen by the people, but nominated, probably by the Praetor Urbanus, who at a later time presided at their election.</p>
 <p>In criminal cases their main duty was to look to the safer custody of the convicted, and to execute capital punishment. The usual form of execution was, for the upper classes and for women, strangling in prison (<seg lang="la">triumvirale supplicium</seg>,  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 5. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>v. 10</bibl>), a fate which befell the fellow-conspirators of Catiline (Sall. <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 55" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>55</bibl>); slaves were crucified, also under their supervision. They had also the duty of receiving charges (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Aul. 413" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aul.</title>413</bibl>) and of arresting offenders; and generally of looking after the police of Rome, for which purpose they had a post in the Forum near the Columna Maenia ( <title>Pro Cluent.</title> 13, 39). Their duty was to go the round of the streets by night, and to seize and punish disorderly characters (<bibl n="Pl. Am. 155" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Amph.</title> ad init.</bibl>), and, as being charged with the safety of the city, they were required to be present at once in cases of fire. There is no trace of any independent criminal jurisdiction; even a slave had to be condemned by a regular court; but this does not preclude the administration of such punishment as was necessary to keep order. They had further to exact and to pay into the treasury the <seg lang="la">sacramenta</seg> due in civil suits, and to decide upon the obligation to serve as <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>31</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Brut. 117" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Brut., 117</bibl>).

 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Coloniae Deducendae</hi> were persons appointed to superintend the formation of a colony.

 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Equĭtum Turmas Recognoscendi</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Legendis Equĭtum Decuriis</hi>, were magistrates first appointed by Augustus to revise the lists of the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, not at the census, but at the <seg lang="la">transvectio equitum</seg>, and to admit persons into the order, which was formerly part of the duties of the censors ( <bibl n="Suet.

 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Reipublĭcae Constituendae</hi>.

Epit. 103" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>103</bibl>), is usually called the First Triumvirate, and that between Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus, the Second; but it must be borne in mind that the former never bore the title of tresviri, nor were invested with any office under that name, whereas the latter were recognized as regular magistrates under the above-mentioned title.</p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tresvĭri Sacris Conquirendis Donisque Persignandis</hi>, extraordinary officers elected in the Comitia Tributa in the time of the Second Punic War, to take care that all property given or consecrated to the gods was applied to that purpose (<bibl n="Liv.  25. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxv. 7</bibl>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χιλίαρχοι</foreign>). Military tribunes; the superior officers of the Roman legions, six in number, two of whom always held the command for two months on alternate days. They were appointed before the levy took place, as they themselves had to be in office at that time. Originally they were nominated by the consuls; afterwards partly by them and partly by the people, inasmuch as the people elected twenty-four out of the number of candidates in the Comitia Tributa for <cb /> the four legions which were levied regularly every year, while the consuls retained the appointment for the remaining legions. They were not as a rule taken from veteran centurions, but for the greater part from young men of senatorial or equestrian rank who had served their first campaign in the train or on the staff of a general, and then began their political career with this office. As a mark of distinction, all of them wore the gold ring of the equestrian order. They also wore a narrow or broad purple stripe on their <seg lang="la">toga</seg>, according as they were of equestrian or senatorial rank respectively. In the time of the Empire, they always led the legion on the march and in battle. They did not, however, as under the Republic, rank immediately below the commandersin-chief, but under the <seg lang="la">legatus legionis</seg>, the commander of the legion and its auxiliary troops.

<head orig="Tribūnus">Tribunus</head>

 <p> a tribune; a word that seems originally to have indicated an officer connected with a tribe (<seg lang="la">tribus</seg>), or who represented a tribe for certain purposes; and this is indeed the character of the officers who were designated by it in the earliest times of Rome, and may be traced also in the later officers of this name.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tribunes of the three ancient Tribes</hi>.— At the time when all the Roman citizens were contained in the three tribes of the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, each of these was headed by a tribune, and these three tribunes represented their respective tribes in all civil, religious, and military affairs; that is to say, they were in the city the magistrates of the tribes, and performed the sacra on their behalf, and in times of war they were their commanders. The <ref type="cross" target="crosstribunus-celerum">Tribunus Celĕrum</ref> was the commander of the <title>Celeres</title>, the king's body-guard, and not the tribune of the tribe of the Ramnes, as is supposed by some modern writers. In what manner the Tribunus Celerum was appointed is uncertain, but it is probable that he was elected by the tribes; for we find that when the imperium was to be conferred upon the king, the Comitia were held under the presidency of the Tribunus Celerum; and in the absence of the king, to whom this officer was next in rank, he convoked the Comitia: it was in an assembly of this kind that Brutus proposed to deprive Tarquinius of the imperium. A law passed under the presidency of the Tribunus Celerum was called a <seg lang="la">lex tribunicia</seg>, to distinguish it from one passed under the presidency of the king. The tribunes of the three ancient tribes ceased to be appointed when these tribes themselves ceased to exist as political bodies, and when the patricians became incorporated in the local tribes of Servius Tullius. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstribus">Tribus</ref>.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tribunes of the Servian Tribes</hi>.—When Servius Tullius divided the commonalty into thirty local tribes, we again find a tribune at the head of these tribes. The duties of these tribunes, who were without doubt the most distinguished persons in their respective districts, appear to have consisted at first in keeping a register of the inhabitants in each district, and of their property, for purposes of taxation, and for levying the troops for the armies. When subsequently the Roman people became exempted from taxes, the main part of their business was taken from them, but they still continued to exist. The <ref type="cross" target="crosstribuni-aerarii">Tribuni Aerarii</ref>, who occur down to the end of the Republic, 
<pb n="1602" /><cb /> were perhaps only the successors of the tribunes of the tribes. When (B.C. 406) the custom of giving pay (<seg lang="la">stipendium</seg>) to the soldiers was introduced, each of the Tribuni Aerarii had to collect the <seg lang="la">tributum</seg> (q. v.) in his own tribe, and with it to pay the soldiers; and in case they did not fulfil this duty, the soldiers had the right of <seg lang="la">pignoris capio</seg> against them. In later times their duties appear to have been confined to collecting the <seg lang="la">tributum</seg>, which they made over to the military quaestors who paid the soldiers. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossquaestores">Quaestor</ref>.) The Lex Aurelia, B.C. 70, called the Tribuni Aerarii to the exercise of judicial functions along with the senators and equites, as these tribunes represented the body of the most respectable citizens. But of this distinction they were subsequently deprived by Iulius Caesar.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tribūni Plebis</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">δήμαρχοι</foreign>).—The ancient tribunes of the plebeian tribes had undoubtedly the right of convoking the meetings of their tribes, and of maintaining the privileges granted to them by King Servius, and subsequently by the Valerian laws. But this protection was very inadequate against the insatiable ambition and usurpations of the patricians. When the plebeians, impoverished by long wars, and cruelly oppressed by the patricians, at last seceded in B.C. 494 to the Mons Sacer, the patricians were obliged to grant to the plebeians the right of appointing tribunes (<seg lang="la">tribuni plebis</seg>) with more efficient powers to protect their own order than those which were possessed by the heads of the tribes. The purpose for which they were appointed was only to afford protection against any abuse on the part of the patrician magistrates; and that they might be able to afford such protection their persons were declared sacred and inviolable, and it was agreed that whoever invaded this inviolability should be an outlaw, and that his property should be forfeited to the Temple of Ceres. A subsequent law enacted that no one should oppose or interrupt a tribune while addressing the people, and that whoever should act contrary to this ordinance should give bail to the tribunes for the payment of whatever fine they should affix to his offence in arraigning him before the commonalty; if he refused to give bail, his life and property were forfeited. The tribunes were thus enabled to afford protection to any one who appealed to the assembly of the commonalty or required any other assistance. They were essentially the representatives and the organs of the plebeian order, and their sphere of action was the Comitia Tributa. With the patricians and their Comitia they had nothing to do. The tribunes themselves, however, were not judges, and could inflict no punishments, but could only propose the imposition of a fine to the commonalty (<seg lang="la">multam irrogare</seg>). The tribunes were thus in their origin only a protecting magistracy of the plebs, but in the course of time their power increased to such a degree that it surpassed that of all other magistrates, and the tribunes then became a magistracy for the whole Roman people, in opposition to the Senate and the oligarchical party in general, although they had nothing to do with the administration or the government. During the latter period of the Republic they became true tyrants, and may be compared to the National Convention of France during the first Revolution. At first the number of the tribunes was only two, but soon afterwards they were <cb /> increased to five, one being taken from each of the five classes, and subsequently to ten, two being taken from each of the five classes. This last number appears to have remained unaltered down to the end of the Empire. The tribunes entered upon their office on the 10th of December, but were elected, at least in the time of Cicero, on the 17th of July. It is almost superfluous to state that none but plebeians were eligible to the office of tribune; hence when, towards the end of the Republic, patricians wished to obtain the office, they were obliged first to renounce their own order and to become plebeians; hence also, under the Empire, it was thought that the <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> (q. v.) should not be tribune because he was a patrician. But the influence which belonged to this office was too great for the emperors not to covet it. Hence Augustus was made tribune for life. During the Republic, however, the old regulation remained in force, even after the tribunes had ceased to be the protectors of the plebs alone. There is only one instance recorded in which patricians were elected to the tribuneship, and this was probably the consequence of an attempt to divide the tribuneship between the two orders. Although nothing appears to be more natural than that the tribunes should originally have been elected by that body of Roman citizens which they represented, yet the subject is involved in considerable obscurity. Some writers state that they were elected by the Comitia Curiata; others suppose that they were elected in the Comitia Centuriata; but whether they were elected in the latter or in the Comitia of the Tribes, it is certain that at first the sanction of the curies to the election was at all events necessary. But after the time of the Lex Publilia (B.C. 472) the sanction of the curies is not heard of, and the election of the tribunes was left entirely to the Comitia Tributa, which were convoked and held for this purpose by the old tribunes previous to the expiration of their office. One of the old tribunes was appointed by lot to preside at the election. As the meeting could not be prolonged after sunset, and the business was to be completed in one day, it sometimes happened that it was obliged to break up before the election was completed, and then those who were elected filled up the legitimate number of the college by <hi rend="italic">coöptatio.</hi> But in order to prevent this irregularity, the tribune L. Trebonius, in B.C. 448, got an ordinance passed, according to which the college of the tribunes should never be completed by <hi rend="italic">coöptatio</hi>, but the elections should be continued on the second day, if they were not completed on the first, till the number ten was made up. The place where the election of the tribunes was held was originally and lawfully the Forum, afterwards also the Campus Martius, and sometimes the area of the Capitol.</p>
 <p>We now proceed to trace the gradual growth of the tribunitian power. Although its original character was merely protection (<seg lang="la">auxilium</seg> or <foreign lang="greek">βοήθεια</foreign>) against patrician magistrates, the plebeians appear early to have regarded their tribunes also as mediators or arbitrators in matters among themselves. The whole power possessed by the college of tribunes was designated by the name <seg lang="la">tribunicia potestas</seg>, and extended at no time farther than one mile beyond the gates of the city; at a greater distance than this they came under the imperium of the magistrates, like every other citizen. As they 
<pb n="1603" /><cb />
 were the public guardians, it was necessary that every one should have access to them at any time; hence the doors of their houses were open day and night for all who were in need of help and protection, which they were empowered to afford against any one, even against the highest magistrates. For the same reason a tribune was not allowed to be absent from the city for a whole day, except during the Feriae Latinae, when the whole people were assembled on the Alban Mount. In B.C. 456 the tribunes, in opposition to the consuls, assumed the right of convoking the Senate, in order to lay before it a rogation, and discuss the same; for until that time the consuls alone had had the right of laying <hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi> before the Senate for approbation. Some years after, B.C. 452, the tribunes demanded of the consuls to request the Senate to make a <hi rend="italic">senatusconsultum</hi> for the appointment of persons to frame a new legislation; and during the discussions on this subject the tribunes themselves were present in the Senate. The written legislation which the tribunes then wished can only have related to their own order; but as such a legislation would only have widened the breach between the two orders, they afterwards gave way to the remonstrances of the patricians, and the new legislation was to embrace both orders. From the second decemvirate the tribuneship was suspended, but was restored after the legislation was completed, and now assumed a different character from the change that had taken place in the tribes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstribus">Tribus</ref>.) The tribunes now had the right to be present at the deliberations of the Senate; but they did not sit among the senators themselves, but upon benches before the opened doors of the senate-house. The inviolability of the tribunes, which had before only rested upon a contract between the two estates, was now sanctioned and confirmed by a law of M. Horatius. As the tribes now also included the patricians and their clients, the tribunes might naturally be asked to interpose on behalf of any citizen, whether patrician or plebeian. Hence the patrician ex-decemvir Appius Claudius implored the protection of the tribunes. About this time the tribunes also acquired the right of taking the auspices in the assemblies of the tribes. They also assumed again the right, which they had exercised before the time of the decemvirate, of bringing patricians who had violated the rights of the plebeians before the Comitia of the Tribes. By the Lex Valeria, passed in the Comitia Centuriata (B.C. 449), it was enacted that a plebiscitum, which had been voted by the tribes, should bind the patricians as well. While the college thus gained outwardly new strength every day, a change took place in its internal organization which to some extent paralyzed its powers. Before B.C. 394, everything had been decided in the college by a majority; but about this time, we do not know how, a change was introduced, which made the opposition (<seg lang="la">intercessio</seg>) of one tribune sufficient to render a resolution of his colleagues void. This new regulation does not appear in operation till 394 and 393 <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c.;</hi> the old one was still applied in B.C. 421 and 415. From their right of appearing in the Senate, and of taking part in its discussions, and from their being the representatives of the whole people, they gradually obtained the right of intercession against any action which a magistrate might undertake during the time of his office, and this even without giving any reason for it. Thus <cb /> we find a tribune preventing a consul from convoking the Senate, and preventing the proposal of new laws or elections in the Comitia; they interceded against the official functions of the censors; and even against a command issued by the praetor. In the same manner a tribune might place his veto upon an ordinance of the Senate; and he could thus either compel the Senate to submit the subject to a fresh consideration, or could raise the session. In order to propose a measure to the Senate they might themselves convene a meeting, or when it had been convened by a consul they might make their proposal even in opposition to the consul, a right which no other magistrates had in the presence of the consuls. The Senate, on the other hand, had itself, in certain cases, recourse to the tribunes. Thus, in B.C. 431 it requested the tribunes to compel the consuls to appoint a dictator, in compliance with a decree of the Senate, and the tribunes compelled the consuls, by threatening them with imprisonment, to appoint A. Postumius Tubertus dictator. From this time forward we meet with several instances in which the tribunes compelled the consuls to comply with the decrees of the Senate, <seg lang="la">si non essent in auctoritate senatus</seg>, and to execute its commands. In their relation to the Senate a change was introduced by the <title>plebiscitum Atinium</title>, which ordained that a tribune, by virtue of his office, should be a senator. When this plebiscitum was made is uncertain; but we know that in B.C. 170 it was not yet in operation. It probably originated with C. Atinius, who was tribune in B.C. 132. But as the quaestorship, at least in later times, was the office which persons held previously to the tribuneship, and as the quaestorship itself conferred upon a person the right of a senator, the law of Atinius was in most cases superfluous.</p>
 <p>In their relation to other magistrates we may observe, that the right of <seg lang="la">intercessio</seg> was not confined to stopping a magistrate in his proceedings, but they might even command their <seg lang="la">viatores</seg> to seize a consul or a censor, to imprison him, or to throw him from the Tarpeian Rock. When the tribunes brought an accusation against any one before the people, they had the right of <seg lang="la">prehensio</seg>, but not the right of <seg lang="la">vocatio;</seg> that is, they might command a person to be dragged by their <seg lang="la">viatores</seg> before the Comitia, but they could not summon him. They might, as in earlier times, propose a fine to be inflicted upon the person accused before the Comitia, but in some cases they dropped this proposal and treated the case as a capital one. The college of tribunes had also the power of making edicts. In cases in which one member of the college opposed a resolution of his colleagues nothing could be done, and the measure was dropped; but this useful check was removed by the example of Tiberius Gracchus, in which a precedent was given for proposing to the people that a tribune obstinately persisting in his veto should be deprived of his office. From the time of the Hortensian law the power of the tribunes had been gradually rising to such a height that at length it was superior to every other in the State. They had acquired the right of proposing to the Comitia Tributa or the Senate measures on nearly all the important affairs of the State, and it would be endless to enumerate the cases in which their power was manifested. Their proposals were indeed usually made <seg lang="la">ex auctoritate senatus</seg>, or had been communicated 
<pb n="1604" /><cb />
 to and approved by it; but in cases in which the people itself had a direct interest, such as a general legal regulation, granting of the franchise, a change in the duties and powers of a magistrate, and others, might be brought before the people, without their having been previously communicated to the Senate, though there are also instances of the contrary. Subjects belonging to the administration could not be brought before the tribes without the tribunes having previously received through the consuls the <seg lang="la">auctoritas</seg> of the Senate. This, however, was done very frequently, and hence we have mention of a number of plebiscita on matters of administration. It sometimes even occurs that the tribunes brought the question concerning the conclusion of peace before the tribes, and then compelled the Senate to ratify the resolution, as expressing the wish of the whole people. Sulla , in his reform of the constitution on the early aristocratic principles, left to the tribunes only the <seg lang="la">ius auxiliandi</seg>, and deprived them of the right of making legislative or other proposals, either to the Senate or the Comitia, without having previously obtained the sanction of the Senate. But this arrangement did not last, for Pompey restored to them their former rights. During the latter period of the Republic, when the office of quaestor was in most cases held immediately before that of tribune, the tribunes were generally elected from among the senators, and this continued to be the case under the Empire. Sometimes, however, <seg lang="la">equites</seg> also obtained the office, and thereby became members of the Senate, where they were considered of equal rank with the quaestors. The tribunes of the people continued to exist down to the fifth century of our era, though their powers became naturally much limited, especially in the reign of Nero. They continued, however, to have the right of intercession against decrees of the Senate, and on behalf of injured individuals. See R. Müller, <bibl default="NO"><title>Gesetz der zehn Tribunen</title> (Berlin, 1877)</bibl>; and the account in Bouché-Leclercq, <bibl default="NO"><title>Institutions Romaines</title> (Paris, 1886)</bibl>; Mommsen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Röm. Staatsrecht</title> (Leipzig, 1876)</bibl>; and for a simpler treatment, see Marlot, <bibl default="NO"><title>Précis des Institutions Politiques de Rome</title> (Paris, 1886)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tribūni milĭtum cum consulāri potestate</hi>.—When in B.C. 445 the tribune C. Canuleius brought forward the rogation that the consulship should not be confined to either order, the patricians evaded the attempt by a change in the constitution; the powers which had hitherto been united in the consulship were now divided between two magistrates—viz., the <seg lang="la">tribuni militum cum consulari potestate</seg> and the censors. Consequently, in B.C. 444, three military tribunes, with consular power, were appointed, and to this office the plebeians were to be equally eligible with the patricians. For the years following, however, the people were to be at liberty, on the proposal of the Senate, to decide whether consuls were to be elected according to the old customs, or consular tribunes. Henceforth, for many years, sometimes consuls and sometimes consular tribunes were appointed, and the number of the latter varied from three to four, until in B.C. 405 it was increased to six, and, as the censors were regarded as their colleagues, we have sometimes mention of eight tribunes. At last, however, in B.C. 367, the office of these tribunes was abolished by the Licinian law, and the consulship was restored. These consular <cb /> tribunes were elected in the Comitia Centuriata, and undoubtedly with less solemn auspices than the consuls.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φῦλον, φυλή</foreign>), a tribe. <hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek</hi>.—In the earliest times of Greek history mention is made of people being divided into tribes and clans. Homer speaks of such divisions in terms which seem to imply that they were elements that entered into the composition of every community. A person not included in any clan (<foreign lang="greek">ἀφρήτωρ</foreign>) was regarded as a vagrant or outlaw. These divisions were rather natural than political, depending on family connection, and arising out of those times when each head of a family exercised a patriarchal sway over its members. The bond was cemented by religious communion, sacrifices, and festivals, which all the family or clansmen attended, and at which the chief usually presided.</p>
 <p>Of the Dorian race there were originally three tribes, traces of which are found in all the countries which they colonized. Hence they are called by Homer <foreign lang="greek">Δωριέες τριχάϊκες</foreign>. These tribes were the Hylleis (<foreign lang="greek">Ὑλλεῖς</foreign>), Pamphyli (<foreign lang="greek">Πάμφυλοι</foreign>), and Dymanatae or Dymanes (<foreign lang="greek">Δυμανάται</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Δυμᾶνες</foreign>). The first derived their name from Hyllus, son of Heracles, the two last from Pamphylus and Dymas, who are said to have fallen in the last expedition when the Dorians took possession of the Peloponnesus. The Hyllean tribe was perhaps the one of highest dignity; but at Sparta there does not appear to have been much distinction, for all the freemen there were by the constitution of Lycurgus on a footing of equality. To these three tribes others were added in different places, either when the Dorians were joined by other foreign allies, or when some of the old inhabitants were admitted to the rank of citizenship or equal privileges. Thus the Cadmean Aegeids are said by Herodotus to have been a great tribe at Sparta, descended (as he says) from Aegeus, grandson of Theras, though others have thought they were incorporated with the three Doric tribes. The subdivision of tribes into <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">φρατρίαι</foreign>) or <hi rend="italic">patrae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">πάτραι</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">gené</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">trittyes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τρίττυες</foreign>), etc., appears to have prevailed in various places. At Sparta each tribe contained ten <hi rend="italic">obae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὠβαί</foreign>), a word denoting a local division or district; each <seg lang="la">obé</seg> contained ten <hi rend="italic">triacades</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τριακάδες</foreign>), communities containing thirty families. But very little appears to be known of these divisions, how far they were local, or how far genealogical. After the time of Cleomenes the old system of tribes was changed; new ones were created corresponding to the different quarters of the town, and they seem to have been five in number. The first Attic tribes that we read of are said to have existed in the reign, or soon after the reign, of Cecrops, and were called Cecropis (<foreign lang="greek">Κεκροπίς</foreign>), Autochthon (<foreign lang="greek">Αὐτόχθων</foreign>), Actaea (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀκταία</foreign>), and Paralia (<foreign lang="greek">Παραλία</foreign>). In the reign of a subsequent king, Cranaüs, these names were changed to Cranaïs (<foreign lang="greek">Κραναΐς</foreign>), Atthis (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀτθίς</foreign>), Mesogaea (<foreign lang="greek">Μεσόγαια</foreign>), and Diacris (<foreign lang="greek">Διακρίς</foreign>). Afterwards we find a new set of names: Dias (<foreign lang="greek">Διάς</foreign>), Athenaïs (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθηναΐς</foreign>), Poseidonias (<foreign lang="greek">Ποσειδωνιάς</foreign>), and 
<pb n="1605" /><cb /> Hephaestias (<foreign lang="greek">Ἡφαιστιάς</foreign>), evidently derived from the deities who were worshipped in the country. Some of those secondly mentioned, if not all of them, seem to have been geographical divisions; and it is not improbable that, if not independent communities, they were at least connected by a very weak bond of union. But all these tribes were superseded by four others, which were probably founded soon after the Ionic settlement in Attica, and seem to have been adopted by other Ionic colonies out of Greece. The names Geleontes (<foreign lang="greek">Γελέοντες</foreign>), Hopletes (<foreign lang="greek">Ὅπλητες</foreign>), Argades (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀργάδεις</foreign>), Aegicores (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰγικορεῖς</foreign>), are said by Herodotus to have been derived from the sons of Ion, son of Xuthus. Upon this, however, many doubts have been thrown by modern writers. The etymology of the last three names would seem to suggest that the tribes were so called from the occupations which their respective members followed; the Hopletes being the armed men, or warriors; the Argades, labourers or husbandmen; the Aegicores, goatherds or shepherds. But whatever be the truth with respect to the origin of these tribes, one thing is certain, that before the time of Theseus, whom historians agree in representing as the great founder of the Attic commonwealth, the various people who inhabited the country continued to be disunited and split into factions. <ref type="cross" target="crosstheseus">Theseus</ref> (q.v.) is said to have changed the relations of the tribes to each other, by introducing a gradation of ranks in each; dividing the people into Eupatridae (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐπατρίδαι</foreign>), Geomori (<foreign lang="greek">Γεωμόροι</foreign>), and Demiurgi (<foreign lang="greek">Δημιουργοί</foreign>), of whom the first were nobles, the second agriculturists or yeomen, the third labourers and mechanics. At the same time, in order to consolidate the national unity, he enlarged the city of Athens, in which he incorporated several smaller towns, made it the seat of government, encouraged the nobles to reside there, and surrendered a part of the royal prerogative in their favour. The tribes or phylae were divided, either in the age of Theseus or soon after, each into three <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">φρατρίαι</foreign>, a term equivalent to fraternities, and analogous in its political relation to the Roman <seg lang="la">curiae</seg>), and each <hi rend="italic">phratria</hi> into thirty <hi rend="italic">gené</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γένη</foreign>, equivalent to the Roman <seg lang="la">gentes</seg>), the members of a <seg lang="la">genos</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">γένος</foreign>) being called <hi rend="italic">gennetae</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">γεννῆται</foreign>) or <hi rend="italic">homogalactes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμογαλάκτες</foreign>). Each <seg lang="la">genos</seg> was distinguished by a particular name of a patronymic form, which was derived from some hero or mythic ancestor. These divisions, though the names seem to import family connection, were in fact artificial; which shows that some advance had now been made towards the establishment of a closer political union. The members of the <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gené</hi> had their respective religious rites and festivals, which were preserved long after these communities had lost their political importance, and perhaps prevented them from being altogether dissolved. After the age of Theseus, the monarchy having been first limited and afterwards abolished, the whole power of the State fell into the hands of the Eupatridae or nobles, who held all civil offices, and had besides the management of religious affairs and the interpretation of the laws. Attica became agitated by feuds, and we find the people, shortly before the legislation of Solon, divided into three parties—Pediaei (<foreign lang="greek">Πεδιαῖοι</foreign>) or lowlanders, Diacrii (<foreign lang="greek">Διάκριοι</foreign>) or highlanders, and Parali (<foreign lang="greek">Πάραλοι</foreign>) or people of the sea-coast. The first two remind one of the ancient division of <cb /> tribes, Mesogaea and Diacris; and the three parties appear in some measure to represent the classes established by Theseus, the first being the nobles, whose property lay in the champaign and most fertile part of the country; the second, the smaller land-owners and shepherds; the third, the trading and mining class, who had by this time risen in wealth and importance. To appease their discords, Solon was called in; and thereupon framed his celebrated constitution and code of laws. Here we have only to notice that he retained the four tribes as he found them, but abolished the existing distinctions of rank, or at all events greatly diminished their importance, by introducing his property qualification, or division of the people into Pentacosiomedimni (<foreign lang="greek">Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι</foreign>), Hippeis (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππεῖς</foreign>), Zeugitae (<foreign lang="greek">Ζευγῖται</foreign>), and Thetes (<foreign lang="greek">Θῆτες</foreign>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssolon">Solon</ref>.) The enactments of Solon continued to be the law at Athens, though in great measure suspended by the tyranny, until the democratic reform effected by Clisthenes. He abolished the old tribes, and created ten new ones, according to a geographical division of Attica, and named after ten of the ancient heroes: Erechtheïs, Aegeïs, Pandionis, Leontis, Acamantis, Oeneïs, Cecropis, Hippothoöntis, Aeantis, Antiochis. These tribes were divided each into ten <seg lang="la">demi</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">δῆμοι</foreign>), the number of which was afterwards increased by subdivision; but the arrangement was so made that several demes not contiguous or near to one another were joined to make up a tribe. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemus">Demus</ref>.) The object of this arrangement was that, by the breaking of old associations, a perfect and lasting revolution might be effected in the habits and feelings as well as the political organization of the people. Solon allowed the ancient <hi rend="italic">phratriae</hi> to exist, but they were deprived of all political importance. All foreigners admitted to the citizenship were registered in a phyle and demus, but not in a phratria or genos. The functions which had been discharged by the old tribes were now mostly transferred to the <seg lang="la">demi.</seg> Among others, we may notice that of the forty-eight <hi rend="italic">naucrariae</hi> into which the old tribes had been divided for the purpose of taxation, but which now became useless, the taxes being collected on a different system. The reforms of <ref type="cross" target="crossclisthenes">Clisthenes</ref> (q.v.) were destined to be permanent. They continued to be in force (with some few interruptions) until the downfall of Athenian independence. The ten tribes were blended with the whole machinery of the constitution. Of the Senate of Five Hundred, fifty were chosen from each tribe. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossboule">Boulé</ref>.) The allotment of dicasts was according to tribes; and the same system of election may be observed in most of the principal offices of State, judicial and magisterial, civil and military, etc. In B.C. 307, Demetrius Poliorcetes increased the number of tribes to twelve by creating two new ones—namely, Antigonias and Demetrias, which afterwards received the names of Ptolemaïs and Attalis; and a thirteenth was subsequently added by Hadrian, bearing his own name.</p>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Roman</hi>.—The three ancient Romulian tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, or the Ramnenses, Titienses, and Lucerenses, to which the patricians alone belonged, 
<pb n="1606" /><cb /> must be distinguished from the thirty plebeian tribes of Servius Tullius, which were entirely local—four for the city, and twenty-six for the country around Rome. The history and organization of the three ancient tribes are mentioned under <ref type="cross" target="crosspatricii">Patricii</ref>. They continued of political importance almost down to the period of the decemviral legislation; but after this time they no longer occur in the history of Rome, except as an obsolete institution. The institution and organization of the thirty plebeian tribes, and their subsequent reduction to twenty by the conquests of Porsena, are mentioned under <hi rend="SmallCaps">Plebes</hi>. The four city tribes were called by the same names as the regions which they occupied, viz., Suburana, Esquilina, Collina, and Palatina. The names of the sixteen country tribes which continued to belong to Rome after the conquest of Porsena are in their alphabetical order as follows: Aemilia, Camilia, Cornelia, Fabia, Galeria, Horatia, Lemonia, Menemia, Papiria, Pollia, Popillia, Pupinia, Romilia, Sergia, Veturia, and Voltinia. As Rome gradually acquired possession of more of the surrounding territory, the number of tribes also was gradually increased. When Appius Claudius, with his numerous train of clients, emigrated to Rome, lands were assigned to them in the district where the Anio flows into the Tiber, and a new tribe, the <title>tribus Claudia</title>, was formed. This tribe was subsequently enlarged, and was then designated by the name Crustumina or Clustumina. This name is the first instance of a country tribe being named after a place, for the sixteen older ones all derived their name from persons or heroes. In B.C. 387, the number of tribes was increased to twenty-five by the addition of four new ones—viz., the Stellatina, Tromentina, Sabatina, and Arniensis. In B.C. 358 two more, the Pomptina and Publilia, were formed of Volscians. In B.C. 332, the censors Q. Publilius Philo and Sp. Postumius increased the number of tribes to twenty-nine, by the addition of the Maecia and Scaptia. In B.C. 318 the Ufentina and Falerina were added. In B.C. 299 two others, the Aniensis and Terentina, were added by the censors, and at last, in B.C. 241, the number of tribes was augmented to thirty-five, by the addition of the Quirina and Velina. Eight new tribes were added upon the termination of the Social War, to include the Socii, who then obtained the Roman franchise; but they were afterwards incorporated among the old thirty-five tribes, which continued to be the number of the tribes to the end of the Republic. When the tribes, in their assemblies, transacted any business, a certain order (<seg lang="la">ordo tribuum</seg>) was observed, in which they were called upon to give their votes. The first in the order of succession was the Suburana, and the last the Arniensis. Any person belonging to a tribe had in important documents to add to his own name that of his tribe, in the ablative case. Whether the local tribes, as they were established by the constitution of Servius Tullius, contained only the plebeians, or included the patricians also, is a point on which the opinions of modern scholars are divided: but it appears most probable that down to the decemviral legislation the tribes and their assemblies were entirely plebeian. From the time of the decemviral legislation, the patricians and their clients were undoubtedly incorporated in the tribes.

 <p> Originally an extraordinary means of revenue among the Romans, levied on the burgesses in the proportion of one to three per thousand in times of war, when the means of the State treasury were of themselves not sufficient, and more especially after B.C. 406, when the State first took over the payment of the soldiers' wages. When the war was over, the money was generally repaid from contributions or from the booty. Subsequent to the conquest of Macedonia, B.C. 167, the income of the State from the provinces was so considerable that the burgesses, although not legally exempt, ceased any longer to be subject to this payment. The strictly regulated taxes of the provinces also went by the same name, <seg lang="la">tributum soli</seg>, the ground-tax, and <seg lang="la">tributum capitis</seg>, the personal tax. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossstipendium">Stipendium</ref>.) Italy, up to his time exempt, was also made liable to these taxes by Diocletian, towards the end of the third century A.D.

The superintendence of the diningroom in a great house was intrusted to a slave called <seg lang="la">tricliniarcha</seg>, who, through other slaves, took care that everything was kept and proceeded in proper order. A triclinium generally contained three couches, and as the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three, the triclinium afforded accommodation for a party of nine. Sometimes, however, as many as four lay on each of the couches.

On this principle we are enabled to explain the denominations both of the three couches, and of the three places on each couch.

Triptolemus was the favourite of Demeter and the inventor of the plough and agriculture, and of civilization, which is the result of it. He was the great hero in the Eleusinian Mysteries. According to the common legend, he hospitably received Demeter at Eleusis, when she was wandering in search of her daughter. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemeter">Demeter</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>, p. 578.) The goddess, in return, wished to make his son Demophon immortal, and placed him in the fire in order to destroy his mortal parts; but Metanira screamed out at the sight, and the child was consumed by the flames. As a compensation for this bereavement, the goddess gave to Triptolemus a chariot with winged dragons and seeds of wheat. In this chariot Triptolemus rode over the earth, making man acquainted with the blessings of agriculture (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

<div2 id="crosstriumphus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Triumphus">Triumphus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θρίαμβος</foreign>). A solemn procession in which a victorious Roman general entered the city in a chariot drawn by four horses. He was preceded by the captives and spoils taken in war, and was followed by his troops; and, after passing in state along the Via Sacra, ascended the Capitol to offer sacrifice in the Temple of Iupiter Capitolinus. From the early days of the Republic down to the extinction of liberty a regular triumph (<seg lang="la">iustus triumphus</seg>) was recognized as the climax of military glory, and was the cherished object of ambition to every Roman general. A triumph might be granted for successful achievements either by land or sea, but the latter were comparatively so rare that we may for the present defer the consideration of the naval triumph. After any decisive battle had been won, or a province subdued by a series of successful operations, the imperator forwarded to the Senate a laurel-wreathed despatch (<seg lang="la">litterae laureatae</seg>) containing an account of his exploits. If the intelligence proved satisfactory, the Senate decreed a public thanksgiving. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssupplicatio">Supplicatio</ref>.) After the war had been concluded, the general with his army repaired to Rome, or ordered his army to meet him there on a given day, but did not enter the city. A meeting of the Senate was held without the walls, usually in the temple of either Bellona or Apollo, that he might have an opportunity of urging his pretensions in person, and these were then scrutinized and discussed with the most jealous care. The following rules were for the most part rigidly enforced, although the Senate assumed the discretionary power of relaxing them in special cases: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) That no one could be permitted to triumph unless he had held the office of dictator, of consul, or of praetor. The honours granted to Pompey, who triumphed in his twenty-fourth year (B.C. 81), before he had held any of the great offices of the State, and again ten years afterwards, while still a simple knight, were altogether unprecedented. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) That the magistrate should have been actually in office both when the victory was gained and when the triumph was to be celebrated. This regulation was insisted upon only during the earlier ages of the commonwealth. Its violation commenced with Q. Publilius Philo, the first per son <cb /> to whom the Senate ever granted a <seg lang="la">prorogatio imperii</seg> after the termination of a magistracy, and thenceforward proconsuls and propraetors were permitted to triumph without question. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) That the war should have been prosecuted or the battle fought under the auspices and in the province and with the troops of the general seeking the triumph. Thus, if a victory was gained by the <seg lang="la">legatus</seg> of a general who was absent from the army, the honour of it did not belong to the former, but to the latter, inasmuch as he had the auspices. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) That at least 5000 of the enemy should have been slain in a single battle, that the advantage should have been positive, and not merely a compensation for some previous disaster, and that the loss on the part of the Romans should have been small compared with that of their adversaries. Nevertheless, we find many instances of triumphs granted for general results, without reference to the numbers slain in any one engagement. (<seg lang="la">e</seg>) That the war should have been a legitimate contest against public foes, and not a civil contest. Hence Catulus celebrated no triumph over Lepidus, nor Antonius over Catiline, nor Cinna and Marius over their antagonists of the Sullan party, nor Caesar after Pharsalia; and when he did subsequently triumph after his victory over the sons of Pompey, it caused universal disgust. (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) That the dominion of the State should have been extended, and not merely something previously lost regained. The absolute acquisition of territory does not appear to have been essential. (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) That the war should have been brought to a conclusion and the province reduced to a state of peace, so as to permit of the army being withdrawn, the presence of the victorious soldiers being considered indispensable in a triumph.</p>
 <p>The Senate claimed the exclusive right of deliberating upon all these points, and of giving or withholding the honour sought, and it for the most part exercised the privilege without question, except in times of great political excitement. The sovereignty of the people, however, in this matter was asserted at a very early date, and a triumph is said to have been voted by the tribes to Valerius and Horatius, the consuls of B.C. 446, in direct opposition to the resolution of the senators, and in a similar manner to C. Marcius Rutilus, the first plebeian dictator; while L. Postumius Megellus, consul B.C. 294, celebrated a triumph although resisted by the Senate and by seven out of the ten tribunes. Moreover, we read of a certain Appius Claudius, consul B.C. 143, who, having persisted in celebrating a triumph in defiance of both the Senate and the people, was accompanied by his daughter (or sister) Claudia, a Vestal Virgin, and by her interposition saved from being dragged from his chariot by a tribune. A disappointed general, however, seldom ventured to resort to such violent measures, but satisfied himself with going through the forms on the Alban Mount (<title>triumphus in Monte Albano</title>), a practice first introduced by C. Papirius Maso. If the Senate gave its consent, it at the same time voted a sum of money towards defraying the necessary expenses, and one of the tribunes <title>ex auctoritate Senatus</title> applied for a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> to permit the imperator to retain his imperium on the day when he entered the city. This last form could not be dispensed with either in an ovation or a triumph, because the imperium conferred by the Comitia 
<pb n="1610" /><cb /> Curiata did not include the city itself; and when a general had once gone forth <seg lang="la">paludatus</seg>, his military power ceased as soon as he re-entered the gates, unless the general law had been previously suspended by a special enactment. In this manner the resolution of the Senate was, as it were, ratified by the plebs. For this reason, no one desiring a triumph ever entered the city until the question was decided, since by so doing he would <seg lang="la">ipso facto</seg> have forfeited all claim. We have a remarkable example of this in the case of Cicero, who, after his return from Cilicia, lingered in the vicinity of Rome day after day, and dragged about his lictors from one place to another, without entering the city, in the vain hope of a triumph.</p>
 <p>In later times these pageants were marshalled with extraordinary pomp and splendour, and presented a most gorgeous spectacle. Minute details would necessarily be different according to circumstances, but the general arrangements were as follows: All the temples were thrown open, garlands of flowers decorated every shrine and image, and incense smoked on every altar. Meanwhile the imperator called an assembly of his soldiers, delivered an oration (<seg lang="la">contio</seg>) commending their valour, and concluded by distributing rewards to the most distinguished, and a sum of money to each individual, the amount depending on the value of the spoils. He then ascended his triumphal car and advanced to the Porta Triumpha<figure id="fig.01610">
<head orig="Imperator in Triumphal Car. (From a marble in Seville.)">Imperator in Triumphal Car. (From a marble in Seville.)</head>
</figure> lis, where he was met by the whole body of the Senate, headed by the magistrates. The procession then defiled in the following order: (1) the Senate, headed by the magistrates;</p>
 <p>(2) a body of trumpeters;</p>
 <p>(3) a train of carriages and frames or litters loaded with spoils, those articles which were especially remarkable either on account of their beauty or rarity being disposed in such a manner as to be seen distinctly by the crowd. Boards were also borne aloft on <seg lang="la">fercula</seg>, on which were painted in large letters the names of vanquished nations and countries. Here, too, models were exhibited in ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and pictures of the mountains, rivers, and other great natural features of the subjugated region, with appropriate inscriptions, gold and silver in coin or bullion, arms, weapons, and cavalry trappings of every description, statues, pictures, vases, and other works of art, precious stones, elaborately wrought and richly embroidered stuffs, and every object which could be regarded as valuable or curious.</p>
 <p>(4) A body of flute <cb /> players.</p>
 <p>(5) The white bulls or oxen destined for sacrifice, with gilded horns, decorated with <seg lang="la">infulae</seg> and <seg lang="la">serta</seg>, attended by the slaughtering priests with their implements, and followed by the Camilli bearing in their hands <seg lang="la">paterae</seg> and other sacred vessels and instruments.</p>
 <p>(6) Elephants or any other strange animals peculiar to the conquered districts.</p>
 <p>(7) The arms and insignia of the leaders of the foe.</p>
 <p>(8) The enemy's leaders themselves, and such of their kindred as had been taken prisoners, followed by the whole band of inferior captives in fetters.</p>
 <p>(9) The crowns (<seg lang="la">coronae</seg>) and other tributes of respect and gratitude bestowed on the imperator by allied kings and States.</p>
 <p>(10) The lictors of the imperator in single file, their fasces wreathed with laurel.</p>
 <p>(11) The imperator himself in a circular chariot of a peculiar form, drawn by four horses, which were sometimes, though rarely, white. He was attired in a goldembroidered robe (<seg lang="la">toga picta</seg>) and a flowered tunic (<seg lang="la">tunica palmata</seg>), and bore in his right hand a laurel bough, and in his left a sceptre. His brows were encircled with a wreath of Delphic laurel, in addition to which, in ancient times, his body was painted bright red. He was accompanied in his chariot by his children of tender years, and sometimes by very dear or highly honoured friends, while behind him stood a public slave, holding over his head a golden Etruscan crown ornamented with jewels. The presence of a slave in such a place at such a time seems to have been intended to avert <seg lang="la">invidia</seg> and the influence of the evil eye, and for the same purpose a <seg lang="la">fascinum</seg> (q. v.), a little bell, and a scourge were attached to the vehicle. Tertullian ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 33" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>33</bibl>) tells us that the slave ever and anon whispered in the ear of the imperator the warning words “<title>Respice post te, hominem memento te</title>,” but this statement is not confirmed by early writers, though mentioned in Arrian.</p>
 <p>(12) Behind the chariot, or on the horses which drew it, rode the sons of the imperator, together with the <seg lang="la">legati</seg>, the <seg lang="la">tribuni</seg>, and the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, all on horseback.</p>
 <p>(13) The rear was brought up by the whole body of the infantry in marching order, their spears adorned with laurel, some shouting “Io Triumphe!” and singing hymns to the gods, while others proclaimed the praises of their leader or indulged in keen sarcasms and coarse ribaldry at his expense, for the most perfect freedom of speech was granted and exercised. Just as the procession was ascending the Capitoline Hill, some of the hostile chiefs were led aside into the adjoining prison and put to death, a custom so barbarous that we could scarcely believe that it existed in a civilized age, were it not attested by the most unquestionable evidence. Pompey, indeed, refrained from perpetrating this atrocity in his third triumph, and Aurelian on a like occasion spared <ref type="cross" target="crosszenobia">Zenobia</ref> (q.v.), but these are quoted as exceptions to the general rule. When it was announced that these murders had been completed, the victims were then sacrificed, an offering from the spoils was presented to Iupiter, the laurel wreath was deposited in the lap of the god, and the imperator was entertained at a public feast along with his friends in the temple. When he returned home in the evening he was preceded by torches and pipes, and escorted by a crowd of citizens. The whole of the proceedings, generally speaking, were brought to a close in one day; but when the quantity of spoil was very great, and the troops very numerous, a longer period was required for the exhibition, <figure id="fig.01611">
<head orig="Triumph of Marcus Aurelius. (Relief in the Palazzo dei Conservatori.)">Triumph of Marcus Aurelius. (Relief in the Palazzo dei Conservatori.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="1611" /><cb /> as when the triumph of Flaminius continued for three days in succession. But the glories of the imperator did not end with the show, nor even with his life. It was customary to provide him at the public expense with a site for a house, such mansions being styled <seg lang="la">triumphales domus.</seg> After death his kindred were permitted to deposit his ashes within the walls, and laurel-wreathed statues standing erect in triumphal cars, displayed in the vestibulum of the family mansion, transmitted his fame to posterity.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">A Triumphus Navālis</hi> appears to have differed in no respect from an ordinary triumph, except that it must have been upon a smaller scale, and would be characterized by the exhibition of beaks of ships (<seg lang="la">rostra</seg>) and other nautical trophies. The earliest upon record was granted to C. Duilius, who laid the foundation of the supremacy of Rome by sea in the First Punic War; and who was so elated by his success that during the rest of his life, whenever he returned home at night from dinner, he caused flutes to sound and torches to be borne before him. A second naval triumph was celebrated by Lutatius Catulus for his victory off the Insulae Aegates (B.C. 241); a third by Q. Fabius Labeo (B.C. 189) over the Cretans; and a fourth by C. Octavius over Perseus, without captives and without spoils.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Triumphus Castrensis</hi> was a procession of the soldiers through the camp in honour of a tribune or any officer inferior to the general, who had performed some brilliant exploit. After the extinction of freedom, the emperor being considered as the supreme commander of all the armies of the State, every military achievement was understood to be performed under his auspices, and hence, according to the forms of even the ancient constitution, he alone had a legitimate claim to a triumph. <cb /> This principle was soon fully recognized and acted upon; for although Antonius had granted triumphs to his <seg lang="la">legati</seg>, and his example had been freely followed by Augustus in the early part of his career, yet after the year B.C. 14 he entirely discontinued the practice, and from that time forward triumphs were rarely, if ever, conceded to any except members of the imperial family. But to compensate in some degree for what was then taken away, the custom was introduced of bestowing what were termed <seg lang="la">triumphalia ornamenta</seg>—that is, permission to receive the titles bestowed upon the imperator of republican times and in the robes worn by him, with the right to bequeath triumphal statues to their descendants.

Herodotus adds that their language was like the twittering of bats, and that their food consisted of lizards and other reptiles. There were also Troglodytae in Moesia, on the banks of the Danube.

<head orig="Troia">Troia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τροία</foreign>). The name of the city of Troy or Ilium; also applied to the country. The mythical account of the kingdom of Troy is briefly as follows. Teucer, the first king, had a daughter who married Dardanus, the chieftain of the country northeast of the Troad (Dardania). Dardanus had two sons, Ilus and Ericthonius, and the latter was the father of Tros, from whom the country and people derived the names of Troas and Troes. Tros was the father of Ilus, who founded the city, which was called after him Ilium, and also, after his father, Troia. The next king was Laomedon, and after him Priam. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspriamus">Priamus</ref>.) In his reign the city was taken and destroyed by the confederated Greeks, after a ten years' siege. (For details see <ref type="cross" target="crossachilles">Achilles</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossaeneas">Aeneas</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossagamemnon">Agamemnon</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossaiax">Aiax</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshector">Hector</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshelena">Helena</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossneoptolemus">Neoptolemus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossodysseus">Odysseus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossparis">Paris;</ref> and especially <ref type="cross" target="crosstrojan-war">Trojan War</ref>.) As to the historical facts which may be regarded as established, there is evidence of a considerable city having been sacked and burned at a period which archaeologists put not later than the twelfth century B.C. <cb /> That this invasion may have been an enterprise of the Achaeans at that time is neither impossible nor unlikely. If the interpretation of recent Egyptian discoveries is right which makes Achaeans appear as assailants of Egypt in the reign of Rameses III., it would follow that the Achaeans of the twelfth or thirteenth century had power and spirit enough for such an enterprise; but in any case the history of Tiryns and Mycenae, as attested by their ruins, is evidence to the existence of their power at that time. There is therefore no reason why the traditions upon which the <title>Iliad</title> is based should not be regarded as true in their main outlines. It is probable enough that to avenge an act of piracy (which is a common and simple explanation of the rape of Helen) the Greeks of the “Achaean” period besieged and sacked Troy and thence returned to hold their own possessions undisturbed until the Dorian invasion. That there was no Greek settlement upon the site of Troy until a much later period is deduced from the remains of towns of a low state of civilization and of small importance which have been discovered above the ruins of the second city.

It was supposed to represent an exercise introduced by Aeneas and the Trojans after their landing in Italy, and celebrated afterwards by Ascanius at Alba ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 5. 597" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>v. 597</bibl>). The earliest mention in historical times is the celebration by Sulla in his dictatorship B.C. 81 ( <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 3" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>3</bibl>), and by Caesar when he dedicated the Temple of Venus (Dio Cass. xliii. 23). Augustus celebrated it certainly twice: first in B.C. 27 (Dio Cass. xlix. 43); on which occasion Tiberius at the age of fifteen was <seg lang="la">ductor turmae puerorum maiorum</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>6</bibl>); secondly, at the dedication of the Temple of Marcellus, B.C. 12, when his grandson Gaius took a chief part. He then discontinued the celebration because Asinius Pollio complained in the Senate that it was a dangerous sport, in which his grandson Aeserninus had broken his leg ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>43</bibl>). Caligula celebrated it in the first year of his reign, and again at the funeral games of Drusilla; and of Nero's boyhood we are told that he often <title>Troiam lusit</title> up to the age of eleven ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 7" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>7</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The method of celebration may be gathered from Vergil ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 5. 553" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>v. 553</bibl>-603). In this account the Trojan boys are first marshalled in three squadrons of twelve each, under Ascanius, Priamus (son of Polites), and Atys. They come forward ceremoniously, much as the gladiators did, or as the performers in a modern bull-fight do now, to salute the spectators before the combat begins: then they break up their triple formation, and, forming into two equal bands, retire to opposite stations. After this, they charged and retired with evolutions so complicated that they seemed to Vergil comparable to nothing but the Cretan Labyrinth or troops of dolphins at play. It is hard to explain why Vergil introduces the difficulty of three leaders and three companies. In all historical accounts there were two. We can hardly doubt that Vergil, under cover of the story of Aeneas, is describing what he actually saw, and this must have 
<pb n="1613" /><cb />
 been the celebration in B.C. 27. In that contest we know from Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Tib.</title>12</bibl>) that Tiberius was one leader, and from the same chapter it may be inferred that Marcellus was another. We may surmise that Vergil introduced this elaborate account for the same reason which led him to bring in the touching allusion to Marcellus in <bibl n="Verg. A. 6." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>vi.</bibl>There may have been a third leader in the preliminary display on that occasion, to give distinction to Sextus Apuleius, the son of Augustus's colleague in the consulship, who, as appears from Tac. ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 2. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>ii. 50</bibl>), afterwards married Marcella, daughter of Octavia. Assuming, then, that in the real celebration of B.C. 27 there were three leaders for the procession, and that for the combat two lines were formed, according to custom, under Tiberius and Marcellus, we may suppose that Vergil makes three corresponding leaders in his Troia—viz., Iulus and Atys out of compliment to Augustus, and a Priamus as appropriate to the Trojan game.

<head orig="Trojan War">Trojan War</head>

 <p> The story of the Trojan War, like the story of the Argonauts, underwent, in the course of time, many changes and amplifications. The main portion of the story is contained in the two epic poems ascribed to Homer, the <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey.</title> The incidents, either narrated or briefly touched upon in these, were elaborated or developed by the post-Homeric poets, partly by connecting them with other popular traditions, and partly by the addition of further details of their own invention. While in Homer it is simply the rape of Helen which is the occasion of the war, a later legend traced its origin to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, when Eris threw down among the assembled gods the golden apple inscribed “For the fairest” (<foreign lang="greek">τῇ καλῇ</foreign>). The quarrel that ensued between Heré, Athené, and Aphrodité for the prize of beauty was decided by Paris in favour of Aphrodité, who in return secured him the possession of Helen, while Heré and Athené became, from that time onward, the implacable enemies of the whole Trojan race.</p>
 <p>According to Homer, after Helen had been carried off by Paris, Menelaüs and Agamemnon visited all the Greek chieftains in turn, and prevailed on them to take part in the expedition which they were preparing to avenge the wrong. According to the later account, the majority of the chieftains were already bound to follow the expedition by an oath, which they had sworn to Tyndareos. Agamemnon was the chosen commander-in-chief; next to him the most prominent Greek heroes are his brother Menelaüs, Achilles, and Patroclus, the two Aiaxes, Teucer, Nestor and his son Antilochus, Odysseus, Diomedes, Idomeneus, and Philoctetes, who, however, at the very outset of the expedition, had to be left behind, and does not appear on the scene of action until just before the fall of Troy. Later epics add the name of Palamedes.</p>
 <p>The entire host of 100,000 men and 1186 ships assembled in the harbour of Aulis. Here, while they were sacrificing under a plane-tree, a snake darted out from under the altar and ascended the tree, and there, after devouring a brood of eight young sparrows and the mother-bird herself, was turned into stone. This omen Calchas, the seer of the host, interpreted to mean that the war <cb /> would last nine years, and terminate in the tenth with the destruction of Troy (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.299" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Iliad</title>, ii. 299-332</bibl>). Agamemnon had already received an oraele from the Delphian god that Troy would fall when the best of the Greeks quarrelled. In Homer the crossing to Troy follows immediately; but in the later story the Greeks at first land by mistake in Mysia, in the country of <ref type="cross" target="crosstelephus">Telephus</ref> (q.v.), and, being dispersed by a storm and driven back to Greece, assemble afresh at Aulis, whence they are only permitted to set out after the sacrifice of Iphigenia (an incident entirely unknown to Homer). On the Greek side the first to fall is Protesilaüs, who is the first to land. The disembarkation cannot take place until Achilles has slain the mighty Cycnus. After pitching their camp, Odysseus and Menelaüs proceed as ambassadors to Troy, to demand the surrender of Helen. But this proposal, in spite of the inclination of Helen herself and the admonition of the Trojan Antenor, falls to the ground, owing to the opposition of Paris, and war is declared. The number of the Trojans, whose chief hero is Hector, scarcely amounts to the tenth part of that of the besiegers; and although they possess the aid of countless brave allies, such as Aeneas, Sarpedon, and Glaucus, in their fear of Achilles they dare not risk a general engagement. On the other hand, the Achaeans can do nothing against the well fortified and defended town, and see themselves confined to laying ambuscades and devastating the surrounding country, and compelled by lack of provisions to have recourse to foraging expeditions in the neighbourhood, undertaken by sea and by land under the generalship of Achilles. At length the decisive tenth year arrives. The Homeric <title>Iliad</title> narrates the events of this year, confining itself to the space of fifty-one days.</p>
 <p>Chryses, priest of Apollo, comes in priestly garb into the camp of the Greeks to ransom his daughter Chryseïs from Agamemnon. He is rudely repulsed, and Apollo consequently visits the Greeks with a plague. In an assembly of the Greeks summoned by Achilles, Calchas declares the only means of appeasing the god to be the surrender of the girl without ransom. Agamemnon assents to the general wish; but, by way of compensation, takes from Achilles, whom he considers to be the instigator of the whole plot, his favourite slave Briseïs. Achilles withdraws in a rage to his tent, and implores his mother Thetis to obtain from Zeus a promise that the Greeks should meet with disaster in fighting the Trojans until Agamemnon should give her son complete satisfaction. The Trojans immediately take the open field, and Agamemnon is induced by a promise of victory, conveyed in a dream from Zeus, to appoint the following day for a battle. The hosts are already standing opposed to one another, prepared for fight, when they agree to a treaty that the conflict for Helen and the plundered treasures be decided by a duel between Paris and Menelaüs. Paris is overcome in the duel, and is only rescued from death by the intervention of Aphrodité. When Agamemnon presses for the fulfilment of the treaty, the Trojan Pandarus breaks the peace by shooting an arrow at Menelaüs, and the first open engagement in the war begins, in which, under the protection of Athené, Diomedes performs miracles of bravery and wounds even Aphrodité and Ares. Diomedes and the Lycian Glaucus are on the point 
<pb n="1614" /><cb />
 of fighting, when they recognize one another as hereditary guest-friends. Hector goes from the battle to Troy, and the day ends with an indecisive duel between Hector and Aiax, son of Telamon. In the armistice ensuing, both sides bury their dead, and the Greeks, acting on the advice of Nestor , surround the camp with a wall and trench. When the fighting begins afresh, Zeus forbids the gods to take part in it, and ordains that the battle shall terminate with the discomfiture of the Greeks. On the following night Agamemnon already begins to meditate flight, but Nestor advises reconciliation with Achilles. The efforts of the ambassadors are, however, fruitless. Hereupon Odysseus and Diomedes go out to reconnoitre, capture Dolon, a Trojan spy, and surprise Rhesus, king of the Thracians, the newly arrived ally of the enemy. On the succeeding day Agamemnon's bravery drives the Trojans back to the walls of the town; but he himself, Diomedes, Odysseus, and other heroes leave the battle wounded; the Greeks retire behind the camp walls, to attack which the Trojans set out in five detachments. The opposition of the Greeks is brave; but Hector breaks the great gate with a rock, and the stream of enemies pours itself unimpeded into the camp. Once more the Greek heroes who are still capable of taking part in the fight, especially the two Aiaxes and Idomeneus , succeed, with the help of Poseidon, in repelling the Trojans, while Telamonian Aiax dashes Hector to the ground with a stone; but the latter soon reappears on the battle-field with fresh strength granted him by Apollo at the command of Zeus. Poseidon is obliged to leave the Greeks to their fate; they retire again to the ships, which Aiax in vain defends. The foremost ship is already burning, when Achilles gives way to the entreaties of his friend Patroclus, and sends him, clad in his own armour, with the Myrmidons to the help of the distressed Greeks. Supposing it to be Achilles himself, the Trojans in terror flee from the camp before Patroclus, who pursues them to the town, and lays low vast numbers of the enemy, including the brave Sarpedon, whose corpse is only rescued from the Greeks after a severe fight. At last Patroclus himself is slain by Hector with the help of Apollo; Achilles' arms are lost, and even the corpse is with difficulty saved. And now Achilles repents of his anger, reconciles himself to Agamemnon, and on the following day, furnished with new and splendid armour by Hephaestus at the request of Thetis, avenges the death of his friend on countless Trojans and finally on Hector himself. With the burial of Patroclus and the funeral games established in his honour, the restoration of Hector's corpse to Priam, and the burial of Hector, for which Achilles allows an armistice of eleven days, the <title>Iliad</title> concludes.</p>
 <p>Immediately after the death of Hector the later legends bring the Amazons to the help of the Trojans, and their queen Penthesilea is slain by Achilles. Then appears Memnon, who is also mentioned by Homer; at the head of his Aethiopians he slays Antilochus son of Nestor , and is himself slain by Achilles. And now comes the fulfilment of the oracle given to Agamemnon at Delphi; for at a sacrificial banquet a violent quarrel arises between Achilles and Odysseus, the latter declaring craft and not valour to be the only means of capturing Troy. Soon after, in an attempt to force a way into the hostile town through the Scaean Gate, <cb /> or, according to later legend, at the marriage of Priam's daughter Polyxena in the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, Achilles falls slain by the arrow of Paris, directed by the god. After his burial, Thetis offers the arms of her son as a prize for the bravest of the Greek heroes, and they are adjudged to Odysseus. Thereupon his competitor, the Telamonian Aiax, slays himself. For these losses, however, the Greeks find some compensation. Acting on the admonition of Helenus, son of Priam, who had been captured by Odysseus, that Troy could not be conquered without the arrows of Heracles and the presence of a descendant of Aeacus, they fetch to the camp Philoctetes, the heir of Heracles, who had been abandoned on Lemnos, and Neoptolemus, the young son of Achilles, who had been brought up on Scyros. The latter, a worthy son of his father, slays the last ally of the Trojans, Eurypylus, the brave son of Telephus; and Philoctetes, with one of the arrows of Heracles, kills Paris. Even when the last condition of the capture of Troy (the removal of the Palladium from the temple of Athené on the citadel) has been successfully fulfilled by Diomedes and Odysseus, the town can only be taken by treachery. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalladium">Palladium</ref>.) On the advice of Athené, Epeius, son of Panopeus, builds a gigantic wooden horse, in the belly of which the bravest Greek warriors conceal themselves under the direction of Odysseus, while the rest of the Greeks burn the camp and embark on board ship, only, however, to anchor behind Tenedos. The Trojans, streaming out of the town, find the horse, and are in doubt what to do with it. According to the later legend they are deceived by the treacherous Sinon, a kinsman of Odysseus, who has of his own free will remained behind. He pretends that he has escaped from the death by sacrifice to which he had been doomed by the malice of Odysseus, and that the horse has been erected to expiate the robbery of the Palladium; to destroy it would be fatal to Troy, but should it be set on the citadel, Asia would conquer Europe. The fate of Laocoön removes the last doubt from the minds of the Trojans (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslaocoon">Laocoön</ref>); the city gate being too small, they break down a portion of the wall and draw the horse up to the citadel as a dedicatory offering for Athené. While they are giving themselves up to transports of joy, Sinon in the night opens the door of the horse. The heroes descend and light the flames that give to the Greek fleet the preconcerted signal for its return. Thus Troy is captured; all the inhabitants are either slain or carried into slavery, and the city is destroyed. The only survivors of the royal house are Helenus, Cassandra, and Hector's wife Andromaché, besides Aeneas. For the fate of the rest see <ref type="cross" target="crossdeiphobus">Deïphobus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshecuba">Hecuba</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspolydorus">Polydorus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspolyxena">Polyxena</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspriamus">Priamus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstroilus">Troïlus</ref>.</p>
 <p>After Troy has been destroyed and plundered, Agamemnon and Menelaüs, contrary to custom, call the drunken Greeks to an assembly in the evening. A division ensues, half siding with Menelaüs in a desire to return home at once; while Agamemnon and the other half wish first to appease by sacrifice the deity of Athené, who has been offended by the outrage of the Locrian Aiax (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaiax">Aiax</ref>, 1). The army consequently sets out on its journey in two parts. Only Nestor , Diomedes, Neoptolemus, Philoctetes, and Idomeneus reach home in safety; while Menelaüs and Odysseus have first to undergo wanderings for many a long year.

 <p>The Trojan legend appears in later literature, both mediaeval and modern, and has inspired much that is interesting and beautiful in art as well. The spurious histories of Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdares">Dares</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdictys">Dictys</ref>) supplied the material for the writers of the Middle Ages, who worked it up into many forms. The Arthurian legends and the Fabliaux both draw from it, and in A.D. 1160 it was elaborated in literary form by Benoît de Sainte-More, whose poem, <title>Le Roman de Troie</title>, in some 30,000 lines, is dedicated to Queen Eleanor of Poitiers and England. In this, the poet has apparently invented new episodes, such as the loves of Briseïda, daughter of Calchas, with Diomedes and Troïlus; whence Boccaccio's poem <title>Filostrato</title>, Chaucer's <title>Troïlus and Cryseyde</title>, and Shakspeare's <title>Troïlus and Cressida</title>, while Gower in his <title>Confessio Amantis</title> also alludes to it. Benoît's poem was translated into German in the twelfth century, into Latin by Guido della Colonna in the thirteenth century, and later into Italian. From it, again, Lydgate derived his <bibl default="NO"><title>Troye Book</title> (first printed in 1513)</bibl>, Caxton his <bibl default="NO"><title>Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</title> (1474)</bibl>, the first book ever printed in English, and Thomas Heywood his <bibl default="NO"><title>Life and Death of Hector</title> (1614)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τροφώνιος</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Agamēdes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀγαμήδης</foreign>). The sons of Erginus of Orchomenus, legendary heroes of architecture. Many important buildings were attributed to them, among others the Temple of Apollo at Delphi (Strabo, p. 421), that of Poseidon at Mantinea (Pausan. viii. 10, 2), the <seg lang="la">thalamos</seg> of Alcmené in Thebes (<hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> ix. 11, 1), the treasuries of Augeas in Elis (Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Nubes</title>, 508), and Hyrieus in Boeotian Hyria ( <bibl n="Paus.  9.37.4" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.ix.37.4</bibl>). In the last named they inserted one stone so cleverly that it could be easily removed from the outside and the treasure stolen by night. But on one occasion, when Agamedes was caught in the trap laid by Hyrieus to discover the thief, Trophonius, to save himself from being betrayed as his brother's accomplice, cut off the head of Agamedes. Being pursued, however, by the king, he was swallowed up in the earth at Lebadea, and by the command of Apollo a cult and an oracle were dedicated to him as Zeus Trophonius.</p>
 <p>The oracle was situated in a subterranean chamber, into which, after various preparatory rites, including the nocturnal sacrifice of a ram and the invocation of Agamedes, the inquirers descended to receive, under circumstances of a mysterious nature, a variety of revelations, which were afterwards taken down from their lips and duly interpreted. The descent into the cave, and the sights which there met the eye, were so awe-inspiring that the popular belief was that no one who visited the cave ever smiled again (Athenaeus, 614 A; cf. <title>Nubes</title>, 508); and it was proverbially said of persons of grave and serious aspect that they had been in the cave of Trophonius—a phrase that has passed into modern literature as a classic allusion.</p>
 <p>According to another story the brothers, after the completion of the Delphic temple, asked Apollo for a reward, and he promised they should have on the seventh day the best thing that could be given to man; and on that day they both died a peaceful death (Cicero, <bibl n="Cic.

After this victory Salvius assumed all the pomp of royalty, and took the surname of Tryphon, probably because it had been borne by Diodotus, the usurper of the Syrian throne. He chose the strong fortress of Triocala as the seat of his new kingdom. Tryphon was defeated by L. Lucullus in 102, and was obliged to take refuge in Triocala. But Lucullus failed to take the place, and returned to Rome without effecting anything more. Lucullus was succeeded by C.

 <p> frequently called by the endearing diminutive <hi rend="bold">Tulliŏla.</hi> The daughter of Cicero and Terentia, born probably B.C. 79 or 78. She was betrothed in 67 to C. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, whom she married in 63, during the consulship of her father. During Cicero's banishment Tullia lost her first husband. She was married again in 56 to Furius Crassipes, a young man of rank and large property; but she did not live with him long, though the time and the reason of her divorce are alike unknown. In 50 she was married to her third husband, P. Cornelius Dolabella, who was a thorough profligate. The marriage took place during Cicero's absence in Cilicia, and, as might have been anticipated, was not a happy one. In 46 a divorce took place by mutual consent. At the beginning of 45 Tullia was delivered of a son, her second child by Dolabella. As soon as she was sufficiently recovered to bear the fatigues of a journey, she accompanied her father to Tusculum, but died there in February.

 <head><surname full="yes">Tullius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Servius</foreName>
 <p>According to the legends, the sixth king of Rome. The stories about his reign merely express the popular idea of the original growth of the Roman constitution; and as he embodies a great part of this growth, the history of which was lost, he is represented as a king with a peaceful reign, devoted to legislation and to public works in the city, but also to military organization. The legendary account states that his mother, Ocrisia, was one of the captives taken at Corniculum, and became a slave of Tanaquil, the wife of Tarquinius Priscus ( <bibl n="Dionys.  4. 2" default="NO">Dionys.iv. 2</bibl>; Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, vi. 625). He was born in the king's palace, and notwithstanding his servile origin was brought up as the king's son, since Tanaquil by her powers of divination had foreseen the greatness of the child; and Tarquinius gave him his daughter in marriage, and intrusted him with the government. His rule was mild and beneficent, and so popular did he become that the sons of Ancus Marcius, fearing lest they should be deprived of their inheritance, procured the assassination of Tarquinius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstarquinius">Tarquinius</ref>.) They did not, however, reap the fruit of their crime, for Tanaquil, pretending that the king's wound was not mortal, told the people that Tarquinius had commanded Servius meantime to discharge the duties of the kingly office. Servius began to act as king; and when the death of Tarquinius could no longer be concealed, he was already in firm possession of the royal power. The great deeds of Servius were deeds of peace, and he was regarded by posterity as the author of all their civil rights and institutions, just as Numa was of their religious rites and ordinances. Three important events are assigned to Servius by tradition. First, he gave a new constitution to the Roman State. The two main objects of this constitution were to give the plebs political independence, and to assign to property that influence in the State which had previously belonged to birth exclusively. In order to carry his purpose into effect, Servius made a twofold division of the Roman people—one territorial, and the other according to property. (For details, see <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.) Secondly, he was credited with the extension of the Pomerium, or boundary of Rome, and with the completion of the “Servian” city by incorporating with it the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline Hills and its fortification. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Roma</ref>.) Thirdly, he established an important alliance with the Latins, by which Rome and the cities of Latium became the members of one great league. By his new constitution Servius incurred the hostility of the patricians, who conspired against him with L. Tarquinius. Servius, soon after his succession, had given his two daughters in marriage to the two sons of Tarquinius Priscus. L. Tarquinius the elder was married to a domestic wife; Aruns, the younger, to an aspiring and ambitious woman. On the other hand, Lucius was proud and haughty, but Aruns unambitious and quiet. The wife of Aruns, fearing that her husband would tamely resign the sovereignty to his elder brother, resolved to destroy both her father and her husband. She persuaded Lucius to murder his wife, and she murdered her own husband; and the survivors straightway married. Tullia now urged her husband to murder her father. A conspiracy was formed with 
<pb n="1618" /><cb />
 the discontented patricians, and Tarquinius, having entered the Senate-house arrayed in the kingly robes, ordered the senators to be summoned to him as their king. At the first news of the commotion, Servius hastened to the Senate-house, and, standing at the doorway, ordered Tarquinius to come down from the throne. Tarquinius sprang forward, seized the old man and flung him down the steps. The king sought refuge in his house, but before he reached it he was overtaken by the servants of Tarquinius and murdered. Tullia drove to the Senate-house, and greeted her husband as king; and as she was returning, her charioteer pulled up, and showed her the corpse of her father lying across the road. She commanded him to drive on: the blood of her father spirted over the carriage and on her dress; and from that day forward the street bore the name of the Vicus Sceleratus— “Wicked Street.” Servius had reigned forty-four years (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 42</bibl>-46; <bibl n="Dionys.  4. 2" default="NO">Dionys.iv. 2</bibl>-12; <title>De Rep.</title> ii. 21; Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, vi. 581).

<div2 id="crosstutela" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tutēla">Tutela</head>

 <p> The office of guardian among the Romans. 
<pb n="1620" /><cb /> It affected not only minors, but also widows and grown-up daughters until the time of their marriage, with the exception of the Vestals. In the case of <hi rend="italic">impuberes</hi> or <seg lang="la">pupilli</seg>, ordinary minors, the guardian (<seg lang="la">tutor</seg>) managed their property until the time of their majority, which with girls began at twelve, with boys at fourteen. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossinfans">Infans</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossimpubes">Impubes</ref>.) At this age the guardianship ended, and girls became, like widows, possessed of independent power over their property, but still remained so far under guardianship that they were unable to take legal proceedings without the consent of their guardians.</p>
 <p>Three kinds of <seg lang="la">tutores</seg> have been distinguished: <seg lang="la">(a) tutor testamentarius</seg>, who was named in the will. By a provision in the will women were sometimes allowed the choice of their guardian, who was then called <seg lang="la">tutor optivus</seg> (“chosen guardian”), to distinguish him from the <seg lang="la">tutor dativus</seg> (or “specified guardian”). If no guardian was named in the will, or the guardian named declined the office, or subsequently resigned it, the next of kin stepped in as <seg lang="la">(b) tutor legitimus.</seg> In the case of a widow, this was the son, if of age, or the husband's brother, and so on. In the case of a daughter, the brother, if of age, the uncle on the father's side, and so on. Among the patricians, if there were no kinsmen, the <seg lang="la">gentiles</seg> undertook the duties. If there was neither a <seg lang="la">tutor testamentarius</seg> nor a <seg lang="la">tutor legitimus</seg>, then the praetor appointed (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a <title>tutor Atilianus</title>, so called because the <title>lex Atilia</title> (about B.C. 188) had introduced this kind of guardian. Under the Empire these guardians were named by the consuls, from the time of Marcus Aurelius by a regular <seg lang="la">praetor tutelaris.</seg> Women having three children were exempted by Augustus from all guardianship. Then Claudius abolished guardianship on the part of the <seg lang="la">agnati</seg> in the case of all women. Diocletian extended this abolition to the case of minors. After the time of Diocletian, guardianship over women fell into disuse, and afterwards women were themselves allowed to act as guardians. A guardian found guilty of betraying his trust was punished by <seg lang="la">infamia</seg> (q. v.). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscurator">Curator</ref>.</p>
 <p>Among the Athenians the guardian (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίτροπος</foreign>), if not named by the father in the will, was generally appointed by the archon from the nearest relations. The archon was also the proper authority in suits relating to guardianship, which, during the minority of the ward, could be brought forward in the form of a public prosecution; and, after the ward had attained his majority, in that of a private lawsuit.

<div2 id="crosstwelve-tables" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Twelve Tables">Twelve Tables</head>

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Duodĕcim Tabŭlae</hi>). The Twelve Tables, the first code of Roman law, <cb /> adopted in B.C. 451 and 450. They remained the foundation of Roman jurisprudence (<seg lang="la">fons omnis publici privatique iuris</seg>, <bibl n="Liv.  3. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 34</bibl>) until the promulgation of the Corpus Iuris (q. v.) by the emperor Justinian (about A.D. 530). Livy (iii. 31-37) and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (x. 55-60) narrate the circumstances under which the code was enacted. The measure was a concession to the plebeians in their struggle with the patrician class. An agitation for written laws, which might serve as a check on the arbitrary acts of the patrician magistrates, had begun as early as 462 (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 9</bibl>). The principal Greek communities had long enjoyed the advantages of such laws. In 454 a commission of three men was sent abroad to study the institutions of Athens and other Greek cities. This commission returned, and finally, in 451, ten men (<hi rend="italic">decemviri</hi>), of whom Appius Claudius was the leading spirit, were chosen as the sole magistrates for the year, with power to draw up laws. The first ten tables were thus produced, and adopted by the Comitia Centuriata. The following year another board of decemviri, still headed by Appius Claudius, was elected, and two more tables were added. A divergent account ( <bibl n="Diod.  12. 26" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xii. 26</bibl>) ascribes the composition of the last two tables to Horatius and Valerius, the consuls of the year 499. The laws were cut on bronze plates, which were hung in a conspicuous place in the Forum (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 57</bibl>). Whether these original copies survived the sack of Rome by the Gauls in B.C. 390 is disputed, the question turning on the ambiguous expression of Livy in vi. 1.</p>
 <p>The authority of the Twelve Tables during the republican period was very great. Boys learned them by heart in the schools ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 4, 9, and 23, 59). Later, this practice was discontinued. Though never repealed, the laws were gradually overlaid by praetorian decisions (<seg lang="la">edicta</seg>), which modified and supplemented them according to existing needs. These edicts came to be more important than the laws themselves ( <title>De Leg.</title> i. 5, 17). There were several ancient commentaries on the Twelve Tables; the latest of these, by Gaius (second century A.D.), is often quoted in the Digests.</p>
 <p>In general, the code of the Twelve Tables is spoken of by ancient writers in terms of admiration. The eleventh and twelfth tables, the work of the unpopular Second Decemvirate, are called by Cicero ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 2. 37" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>ii. 37</bibl><bibl n="Plato Rep. 63" default="NO"> Rep., 63</bibl>) <seg lang="la">duae tabulae iniquarum legum;</seg> but the chief ground for this estimate of them appears to be the law, afterwards annulled, forbidding the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians. It must not be supposed that these two tables were an afterthought; it is clear from the language of Livy and Dionysius that the first ten tables, at the time of their adoption, were understood to be only a partial code, and that further legislation was expected. It is a noteworthy fact that the remarkable set of laws discovered in 1884 at Gortyna in Crete is cut upon a wall in twelve columns. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgortyn">Gortyn</ref>.</p>
 <p>We cannot exactly define the relation of the Twelve Tables to preëxisting Roman law. But it is certain that they contained both new and old elements. There existed already a body of legal usages, and some of these had been formulated in maxims, known as <seg lang="la">leges regiae.</seg> Some of these maxims would seem from the language of Livy (vi. 1) to have existed in written form. The Twelve Tables were based in part 
<pb n="1621" /><cb /> on this older law of custom (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ πάτρια ἔθη</foreign>, <bibl n="Dionys.  10. 55" default="NO">Dionys.x. 55</bibl>; <foreign lang="greek">οἱ παρὰ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἄγραφοι ἐθισμοί</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 57). At least one of the <seg lang="la">leges regiae</seg>, relating to the <seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg>, was embodied in them ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 27" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 27</bibl>). On the other hand, they contained new features, and some of these were certainly derived from Greek sources. Thus we are told in particular by Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 59; 25, 64) that certain clauses restricting expense at funerals were taken almost word for word from the laws of Solon. Like statements are made by Gaius (<title>Dig.</title> x. 1, 13; xlvii. 22, 4) about two other laws. An Ephesian Greek named Hermodorus is said to have aided the decemviri in their work ( Strab. p. 642; Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 5</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny H. N., 11</bibl>). The fact of Greek influence in the decemviral legislation is further brought out by striking resemblances between the Twelve Tables and the inscriptional code of Gortyna just mentioned—resemblances extending even to particular expressions (<seg lang="la">se fraude esto</seg>=<foreign lang="greek">ἄπατων ἤμην</foreign>).</p>
 <p>We possess about 100 fragments of the Twelve Tables, some containing quotations of their exact words, others only statements of content. The most important sources are Gellius (especially the interesting chapter xx. 1), Festus, Cicero, and Gaius. The arrangement of these fragments and their distribution among the Twelve Tables have been much discussed. The following is the system of Dirksen, which has obtained a considerable currency: Tables i. and ii., civil process; iii., procedure for debt; iv., <seg lang="la">patria potestas;</seg> v., guardianship and inheritance; vi., rights of property; vii., contracts; viii., <seg lang="la">delicta</seg> and <seg lang="la">crimina;</seg> ix., <seg lang="la">ius publicum;</seg> x., <seg lang="la">ius sacrum</seg> (including burial); xi. and xii., supplements and additions. This system is based on two things: (1) a few citations in which the number of the table is expressly stated; and</p>
 <p>(2) the citations from Gaius 's commentary, the assumption being that the six books of that commentary corresponded to the twelve tablets of laws taken in pairs. But the validity of this assumption respecting Gaius 's six books has been denied by many recent scholars, and even the hypothesis which underlies this and all previous attempts at arrangement—that the disposition of the code was strictly systematic, and that the contents of each tablet constituted a sort of unity, like a chapter— has been shown to be unsupported by analogies. (See, on all this, Schoell's <title>Prolegomena</title>, pp. 67, 68.) It may be added that the arrangement of the Gortynian Code, already mentioned, shows little system, and that its twelve columns are like pages of a book, and have nothing to do with the divisions of the subject-matter. It should therefore be borne in mind that all that we certainly know respecting the location of the different fragments is this: the law permitting the release of a son from <seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg> by three mancipations (sales) stood in the fourth table ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 27" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 27</bibl>); the sumptuary laws regulating funerals in the tenth ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 25, 64); the prohibition of <seg lang="la">conubium</seg> between patricians and plebeians in one of the last two tables ( <bibl n="Dionys.  10. 60" default="NO">Dionys.x. 60</bibl>). Probably, also, the law defining proper causes of postponement for a suit was in the second table (Festus, p. 273, but the text is conjectural). Lastly, that the first table began with the words <seg lang="la">si in ius vocat, ito</seg> may be fairly inferred from <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 4, 9. It is the opinion of Mommsen that the <title>Fasti</title> or Calendar were contained in the Twelve Tables (cf. <title>Ad</title> <cb /> <bibl n="Ant.  Att. 6. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Att.</title>vi. 1</bibl><bibl n="Ant.  Att. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> Att., 8</bibl>; Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 13" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 13</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 21" default="NO"> Sat., 21</bibl>), and Schoell assigns them to the eleventh table.</p>
 <p>The language of the Twelve Tables abounded in archaisms. As examples may serve <seg lang="la">im=eum, nox =noctu, endo=in (endo iacito inicito), escit=est, lessus=luctus, ast</seg> as conditional particle, ‘and if.’ The condensation of expression is extreme: for instance, the subject is constantly omitted, even where there is a sudden change; as, <seg lang="la">si nox furtum faxsit, si im occisit, iure caesus esto.</seg> The laws contain some noteworthy provisions.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τυδεύς</foreign>). The son of Oeneus, king of Calydon, and Periboea. He was obliged to leave Calydon in consequence of some murder which he had committed, but which is differently described by different authors. He fled to Adrastus at Argos, who purified him from the murder, and gave him his daughter Deïpylé in marriage, by whom he became the father of Diomedes, who is hence frequently called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tydīdes</hi>. He accompanied Adrastus in the expedition against Thebes, where he was wounded by Melanippus, who, however, was slain by him ( <bibl n="Hom.

When Tydeus lay on the ground wounded, Athené appeared to him with a remedy which she had received from Zeus, and which was to make him immortal. This, however, was prevented by a stratagem of Amphiaraüs, who hated Tydeus, for he cut off the head of Melanippus and brought it to Tydeus, who divided it and ate the brain, or devoured some of the flesh. Athené, seeing this, shuddered, and left Tydeus to his fate. He consequently died, and was buried by Macon ( <bibl n="Apollod.  3.6.8" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii.6.8</bibl>; Eustath. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> Hom. p. 1273).

<div2 id="crosstyrannus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Tyrannus">Tyrannus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τύραννος</foreign>). In the Heroic Age all the governments in Greece were monarchical, the king uniting in himself the functions of the priest, the judge, and military chief. In the first two or three centuries following the Trojan War various causes were at work, which led to the abolition, or at least to the limitation, of the kingly power. Emigrations, extinctions of families, disasters in war, civil dissensions, may be reckoned among these causes. Hereditary monarchies became elective; the different functions of the king were distributed; he was called Archon (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων</foreign>), Cosmus (<foreign lang="greek">κόσμος</foreign>), or Prytanis (<foreign lang="greek">πρύτανις</foreign>), instead of Basileus (<foreign lang="greek">βασιλεύς</foreign>), and his character was changed no less than his name. Noble and wealthy families began to be considered on a footing of equality with royalty; and thus in process of time sprang up oligarchies or aristocracies, which most of the governments that succeeded the ancient monarchies were in point of fact, though not as yet called by such names. These oligarchies did not possess the elements of social happiness or stability. The principal families contended with each other for the greatest share of power, and were only unanimous in disregarding the rights of those whose station was beneath their own. The people, oppressed by the privileged classes, began to regret the loss of their old paternal form of government, and were ready to assist any one who would attempt to restore it. Thus were opportunities offered to ambitious and designing men to raise themselves by starting up as the champions of popular rights. Discontented nobles were soon found to prosecute schemes of this sort, and they had a greater chance of success if descended from the ancient royal family. An example is Pisistratus, who was the more acceptable to the people of Athens as being a descendant of the family of Codrus. Thus in many cities arose that species of monarchy which the Greeks called <seg lang="la">tyrannis</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">τυραννίς</foreign>), which meant only a despotism, or the irresponsible dominion of one man. This very frequently was nothing more than a revival of the ancient government, and, though unaccompanied with any recognized hereditary title, or the reverence attached to old name and long prescription, was hailed by the lower orders of people as a good exchange, after suffering under the domination of the oligarchy. All “tyrannies,” however, were not so acceptable to the majority; and sometimes we find the nobles concurring in the elevation of a despot, to further their own interests. Thus the Syracusan <title>Gamori</title>, who had been expelled by the populace, on receiving the protection of Gelon, sovereign of Gela and Camarina, enabled him to 
<pb n="1623" /><cb />
 take possession of Syracuse, and establish his kingdom there. Sometimes the conflicting parties in the State, by mutual consent, chose some eminent man, in whom they had confidence, to reconcile their dissensions, investing him with a sort of dictatorial power for that purpose, either for a limited period or otherwise. Such a person they called <hi rend="italic">aesymnetes</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">αἰσυμνήτης</foreign>). The <seg lang="la">tyrannus</seg> must be distinguished, on the one hand, from the <hi rend="italic">aesymnetes</hi>, inasmuch as he was not elected by general consent, but commonly owed his elevation to some violent movement or stratagem, such as the creation of a body-guard for him by the people, or the seizure of the citadel; and, on the other hand, from the ancient king, whose right depended, not on usurpation, but on inheritance and traditionary acknowledgment. The power of a king might be more absolute than that of a “tyrant,” as Phidon of Argos is said to have made the royal prerogative greater than it was under his predecessors; yet he was still regarded as a king, for the difference between the two names depended upon title and origin, and not on the manner in which the power was exercised. The name “tyrant” was originally so far from denoting a person who abused his power, or treated his subjects with cruelty, that Pisistratus is praised for the moderation of his government. Afterwards, when “tyrants” themselves had become odious, the name also grew to be a word of reproach, just as <seg lang="la">rex</seg> did among the Romans. Among the early “tyrants” of Greece those most worthy of mention are: Clisthenes of Sicyon, grandfather of the Athenian Clisthenes, in whose family the government continued for a century from its establishment by Orthagoras, about B.C. 672; Cypselus of Corinth, who expelled the Bacchiadae, B.C. 656, and his son Periander, both remarkable for their cruelty; their dynasty lasted between seventy and eighty years; Procles of Epidaurus; Pantaleon of Pisa, who celebrated the thirty-fourth Olympiad, depriving the Eleans of the presidency; Theagenes of Megara, father-inlaw to Cylon the Athenian; and Pisistratus, whose sons were the last of the early “tyrants” on the Grecian continent. In Sicily, where “tyranny” most flourished, the principal were Phalaris of Agrigentum, who established his power in B.C. 568; Theron of Agrigentum; Gelon, already mentioned, who, in conjunction with Theron, defeated Hamilcar the Carthaginian, on the same day on which the battle of Salamis was fought; and Hieron, his brother: the last three celebrated by Pindar. The following also are worthy of notice: Polycrates of Samos, Lygdamis of Naxos, Histiaeus and Aristagoras of Miletus. Perhaps the last mentioned can hardly be classed among the Greek “tyrants,” as they were connected with the Persian monarchy.</p>
 <p>The general characteristics of a “tyranny” were, that it was bound by no laws, and had no recognized limitation to its authority, however it might be restrained in practice by the good disposition of the “tyrant” himself, or by fear, or by the spirit of the age. It was commonly most odious to the wealthy and noble, whom the “tyrant” looked upon with jealousy as a check upon his power, and whom he often sought to get rid of by sending them into exile or putting them to death. The “tyrant” usually kept a body-guard of foreign mercenaries, by aid of whom he controlled the people at home; but he seldom ventured to make war, for fear of giving an opportunity to his subjects to revolt. <cb /> The causes which led to the decline of “tyranny” among the Greeks were partly the degeneracy of the “tyrants” themselves, corrupted by power, indolence, flattery, and bad education; for even where the father set a good example, it was seldom followed by the son; partly the cruelties and excesses of particular men, which brought them all into disrepute; and partly the growing spirit of inquiry among the Greek people, who began to speculate upon political theories, and soon became discontented with a form of government which had nothing in theory, and little in practice, to recommend it. Few dynasties lasted beyond the third generation. Most of the tyrannies which flourished before the Persian War are said to have been overthrown by the exertions of Sparta, jealous, probably, of any innovation upon the old Doric constitution, especially of any tendency to ameliorate the condition of the Perioeci, and anxious to extend her own influence over the States of Greece by means of the benefits which she conferred. Upon the fall of “tyranny” the various republican forms of government were established, the Dorian States generally favouring oligarchy, the Ionian democracy. Of the “tyrants” of a later period, the most celebrated are the two Dionysii. The corruption of the Syracusans, their intestine discords, and the fear of the Carthaginian invaders, led to the appointment of Dionysius to the chief military command, with unlimited powers; by means of which he raised himself to the throne B.C. 406, and reigned for thirty-eight years, leaving his son to succeed him. The younger Dionysius, far inferior in every respect to his father, was expelled by Dion, afterwards regained the throne, and was again expelled by Timoleon, who restored liberty to the various States of Sicily.</p>

<head orig="Tyrtaeus">Tyrtaeus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τυρταῖος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Τύρταιος</foreign>). A Greek described as the son of Archembrotus of Aphidnae in Attica. In the seventh century he introduced the Ionic elegy into Sparta. According to the older tradition, the Spartans during the Second Messenian War were commanded by an oracle to take a leader from among the Athenians, and thus to conquer their enemies, whereupon they chose Tyrtaeus as their leader (Plato, <title>De Leg.</title> i. p. 629; <title>c. Leoch.</title> p. 211; <bibl n="Diod.  15. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xv. 66</bibl>). Later writers state that Tyrtaeus was a lame schoolmaster, of low family and reputation, whom the Athenians, when applied to by the Lacedaemonians in accordance with the oracle, purposely sent as the most inefficient leader they could select, being unwilling to assist the Lacedaemonians in extending their dominion in the Peloponnesus, and little thinking that the poetry of Tyrtaeus would achieve that victory to which his physical infirmity seemed to forbid his aspiring ( <bibl n="Paus.  4.15.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.iv.15.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Just.  3. 5" default="NO">Just.iii. 5</bibl>; <bibl n="Themist.  15." default="NO">Themist.xv.</bibl> p. 242; Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>A. P.</title> 402). The poems of Tyrtaeus exercised an important influence upon the Spartans, quieting their dissensions at home, and animating their courage in the field. In order to appease their civil discords, he composed his celebrated elegy entitled <title>Legal Order</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐνομία</foreign>:  <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Pol.</title>v. 7</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Arist. Pol., 1</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus.  4.18.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.iv.18.2</bibl>). But still more celebrated were the poems by which he animated the courage of the Spartans in their conflict with the Messenians. These poems were of two kinds: namely, elegies, containing exhortations to constancy and courage, and descriptions of the glory of fighting bravely for one's native land; and more spirited compositions, in the anapaestic measure, which were intended as marching-songs (<foreign lang="greek">ἐμβατήρια</foreign>), to be accompanied by the music of the flute ( <bibl n="Paus.  4.14.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.iv.14.1</bibl>; Athen. p. 630;  <bibl n="Plut. Cleom. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Cleom.</title>2</bibl>; <title>A. P.</title> 402; <hi rend="italic">Suid. s. v.</hi>). He lived, it is said, to see the success of his efforts in the entire conquest of the Messenians, and their reduction to the condition of Helots. His life therefore lasted down to B.C. 668, which was the last year of the Second Messenian War. It has been observed that Tyrtaeus in a fragment of the <title>Eunomia</title> seems to speak of himself as a Lacedaemonian, and though this might be explained by his having been made a citizen of Sparta, yet Herodotus (ix. 35) does not include him among the few foreigners who became Spartan citizens. Hence some (following Strab. p. 362) have doubted the truth of his Athenian origin. On the other hand, there is so strong a consensus of ancient authorities, including Plato (<hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi>), for his Athenian origin that it can hardly be resisted.</p>

<head orig="Tyrus">Tyrus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τύρος</foreign>: Aram. Tura: O. T. Tsōr). Now Sur; one of the greatest and most famous cities of the ancient world, standing on the coast of Phoenicé, about twenty miles south of Sidon. It was a colony of the Sidonians, but gradually eclipsed the mother city, and came to be the chief place of all Phoenicé for wealth, commerce, and colonizing <cb /> activity. Respecting its colonies and maritime enterprise, see <ref type="cross" target="crossphoenice">Phoenicé</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crosscarthago">Carthago</ref>. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser laid siege to Tyre for five years, but without success. It was again besieged for thirteen years by Nebuchadnezzar, and there is a tradition that he took it, but the matter is not quite certain. At the period when the Greeks began to be well acquainted with the city, its old site had been abandoned, and a new city erected on a small island about half a mile from the shore and a mile in length, and a little north of the remains of the former city, which was now called Old Tyre (<foreign lang="greek">Παλαίτυρος</foreign>). This island, which Pliny estimated at two and three-quarter miles in circumference, was separated from the mainland by a channel seven-tenths of a mile broad ( Strab. p. 756), or according to Diodorus and Curtius, four stadia ( <bibl n="Diod.  17. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvii. 60</bibl>; Q. Curt. iv. 2). At present the breadth is only one-third of a mile. With the additional advantage of its insular position, this new city soon rose to a prosperity scarcely less than that of its predecessor; though under the Persian kings (?) it seems to have ranked again below Sidon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssidon">Sidon</ref>.) There were two harbours: one on the north of the island, known as the Sidonian Harbour, and the other on the south side, known as the Egyptian Harbour ( <bibl n="Arr.

In B.C. 322 the Tyrians refused to open their gates to Alexander, who laid siege to the city for seven months, and united the island on which it stood to the mainland by a mole constructed chiefly out of the ruins of Old Tyre. This mole has ever since formed a permanent connection between the island and the mainland ( <bibl n="Arr.  2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Arr.ii. 17</bibl>-26; Q. Curt. iv. 4-27; <bibl n="Diod.  17. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvii. 40</bibl>-45). After its capture and sack by Alexander, Tyre never regained its former consequence, and its commerce was for the most part transferred to Alexandria. It was subject to the Syrian kings, but became a free city with its own coinage in B.C. 126, and till the time of Augustus, when it lost its independence (Dio Cass. liv. 7). Septimius Severus made it a Roman colony. It was the see of a Bishop, and St. Jerome calls it the most beautiful city of Phoenicia. It was a place of considerable importance in mediaeval history, especially as one of the last points held by the Christians on the coast of Syria.

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossioannes">Ioannes</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Ιωάννης Τζέτζης</foreign>). A Greek grammarian and poet of the second half of the twelfth century A.D. He lived in Constantinople, and though for his time he may be called learned, his erudition is wholly superficial, as is amply proved by his existing writings. Besides commentaries on Homer, Hesiod, Aristophanes, and other classical writers, which are valuable for the authorities quoted in them, he composed, in 1676 feeble hexameters, an epic poem entitled <title>Iliaca</title>, containing the legend of Troy from the birth of Paris till the opening of the <title>Iliad</title>, the incidents of the <title>Iliad</title> in detail, and the further course of the war up to the return of the Greeks. It is in three parts: <title>(a) Ante-Homerica; (b) Homerica; (c) Post-Homerica.</title> Besides this he wrote a book of histories in 12,661 “political verses”— i. e. verses based on accent rather than on syllabic quantity. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspolitici-versus">Politici Versus</ref>.) These are commonly but wrongly called “chiliads” from an arbitrary division of the work into thirteen books of 
<pb n="1625" /><cb /> 1000 lines each. He is also the author of a collection of stories partly mythical, partly historical, worthless in themselves, but valuable as including numerous items of information which would otherwise have been unknown to us. The <title>Iliaca</title> is edited by Bekker <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1816)</bibl> and <cb /> Lehrs <bibl default="NO">(1840)</bibl>; the <title>Chiliades</title> by Kiessling <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1826)</bibl>.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
<note id="ref3" target="n3">The power of the quaestors to fine is disputed by Mommsen. But even curatores could fine. (See Karlowa, Rechtsgeschichte, p. 171.)</note>
<note id="ref4" target="n4">* Very little is known of the architectural character of the early basilicas about the Forum.</note>
<note id="ref5" target="n5">* It is stated that there were but 136 gentes in existence when the Republic was established, and that the Senate was brought up to its normal strength (300) by the free selection of the balance. It is also stated that all, or at least a portion, of the senators thus selected were plebeians; but this seems merely an inference from the other statement, and is, of course, in no sense a necessary inference. Among modern writers the dispute turns largely on the interpretation of the phrase patres conscripti. Many hold that the patres were patricians, the conscripti plebeians. Others assert that the patres were those who sat as representatives of the gentes, and that the rest, whether patricians or plebeians, were conscripti. Others again deny that there was any distinction between patres and conscripti, and translate the phrase, “enrolled senators.”</note>
