<head orig="Dacia">Dacia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δακία</foreign>), as a Roman province, lay between the Danube and the Carpathian Mountains, and comprehended the modern Transylvania, Wallachia, Moldavia, and part of Hungary. The Daci were of the same race and spoke the same language as the Getae, and are therefore usually said to be of Thracian origin. They were a brave and warlike people. In the reign of Domitian they became so formidable under their king, Decebalus, that the Romans were obliged to purchase a peace of them by the payment of tribute. Trajan delivered the Empire from this disgrace. He crossed the Danube, and after a war of five years (A.D. 101-106) conquered the country, and made it a Roman province. At a later period Dacia was invaded by the Goths; and as Aurelian considered it more prudent to make the Danube the boundary of the Empire, he resigned Dacia to the barbarians, removed the Roman inhabitants to Moesia, and gave the name of Dacia (Aureliani) to that part of the province along the Danube where they were settled.

 <head><surname full="yes">Dacier</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Anne Lefèvre</foreName>
 <p>, a famous French translator of the classics, was born at Saumur about 1654. She was the daughter of Tanneguy Lefèvre, a Huguenot scholar of some note. On her father's death, and when in her eighteenth year, she went to Paris, where she soon after published an edition of Callimachus, which secured for her a place among the editors of the <ref type="cross" target="crossdelphin-edition">Delphin Edition</ref> (q.v.) of the classics, for which she prepared notes on Florus, Dictys Cretensis, Aurelius Victor, and Eutropius. In 1681 appeared her prose version of Anacreon and Sappho, followed by similar translations of Terence, selected plays of Plautus and Aristophanes, the <bibl default="NO"><title>Iliad</title> (1711)</bibl>, and the <bibl default="NO"><title>Odyssey</title> (1716)</bibl>. It is by these translations that she will be longest remembered, as she brought to the work much spirit and enthusiasm, combined with a good share of literary insight, so that her renderings are still cited by modern scholars. In her versions of Homer especially, her direct, simple, and often homely language is admirably fitted to express the original. In defence of Homer against La Motte, she wrote a treatise <bibl default="NO"><title>Des Causes de la Corruption de la Goût</title> (1714)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Mlle. Lefèvre married in 1683 M. André Dacier, who subsequently became secretary of the French Academy, and was himself a man of much erudition but little talent, so that he was wittily described as <seg lang="la">un gros mulet chargé de tout le bagage de l'antiquité.</seg> Both husband and wife received pensions from the king. Mme. Dacier died at the Louvre, where her husband was librarian, August 17, 1720. See Sainte-Beuve, <title>Causeries de Lundi</title>, and Burette's <title>Éloge sur Mme. Dacier.</title>

<div2 id="crossdactyli" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dactyli">Dactyli</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δάκτυλοι</foreign>). Fabulous beings, to whom the discovery of iron, and of the art of working it by means of fire, was ascribed. Mount Ida, in Phrygia, is said to have been the original seat of the Dactyli, whence they are usually called Idaean <cb /> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰδαῖοι</foreign>) Dactyli. In Phrygia they were connected with the worship of Rhea, or Cybelé. They are sometimes confounded or identified with the Curetes, Corybantes, and <ref type="cross" target="crosscabeiri">Cabeiri</ref> (q.v.). See <ref type="cross" target="crossrhea">Rhea</ref>.</p>
 <p>The name <foreign lang="greek">Δάκτυλοι</foreign> (“Fingers”) is variously explained from their number being five or ten, or because they dwelt at the foot (<foreign lang="greek">ἐν δακτύλοις</foreign>) of Mount Ida. The original number seems to have been three—i. e. Kelmis (<foreign lang="greek">Κελμίς</foreign>) the Smelter, Damnameneus (<foreign lang="greek">Δαμναμενεύς</foreign>) the Hammer, and Acmon (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄκμων</foreign>) the Anvil. This number was afterwards increased to five, then to ten, to fiftytwo, and finally to one hundred. See Lobeck, <title>Aglaophamos</title>, 1166 foll.; Pollux, ii. 4; <bibl n="Diod.  5. 64." default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.v. 64.</bibl>

<div2 id="crossdactyliotheca" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dactyliothēca">Dactyliotheca</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δακτυλιοθήκη</foreign>). A case or box where rings were kept. Such a ring-case has been recognized in a round ivory box found at Pompeii (<title>Mus. Borb.</title> ix. pl. xiv. 8). From the centre of the lid projects a vertical stick, on which the rings might be slid when the wearer took them off at his toilet. The same purpose may have been served by a bronze stand which was found at Talese. It consists of a rod resting on three feet. Down the <figure id="fig.00463">
<head orig="Dactyliotheca. (Pompeii.)">Dactyliotheca. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> rod may be slid a ring furnished with catches to hold it steady, to one of which is attached a vertical oval ring broken at the top so as to admit of rings or other articles of jewellery being slid upon it. The name was also applied to a cabinet or collection of jewels, as to which we learn from Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 11</bibl>) that Scaurus, the stepson of Sulla , was the first person at Rome who had a collection of this kind, and that his was the only one till Pompey brought to Rome the collection of Mithridates, which he placed in the Capitol.

<head orig="Daedăla">Daedala</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Δαίδαλα</foreign>). (1) A town of Caria, near the confines of Lycia and on the northern shore of the Glaucus Sinus. It was said to have derived its name from Daedalus, who, being stung by a snake on crossing the small river Ninus, died and was buried here.</p>
 <p>(2) A mountain, in the vicinity of the city of the same name and on the confines of Lycia.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossdaedala2" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Daedăla, Daedalēa">Daedala, Daedalea</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δαίδαλα, δαιδάλεια</foreign>). (1) A term applied to the earliest iconic representations of the gods roughly hewn out of wood (<foreign lang="greek">ἄγαλμα ξύλου</foreign>, Pausan. ix. 3, 2). From a very early period stones and trees received divine honours (Lucian, <title>Pseudom.</title> 30). Thus Artemis Sotera at Boiae was a myrtle (Pausan. iii. 22, 12); the Paphian Aphrodité, a conical stone. The effigy of the god, down to the latest times, was placed in a tree. The immediate predecessor, however, of the <foreign lang="greek">δαίδαλον</foreign> was a squared beam or flat board, which, like the pillar, was probably draped and decorated. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedalus">Daedalus</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) A peculiar festival held by the Boeotians in honour of Heré. The goddess had, according to the story, once quarrelled with Zeus and hidden 
<pb n="464" /><cb />
 herself on Mount Cithaeron. Her husband then spread the report that he was going to marry another wife, and had an image of oak-wood decked out in bridal attire and carried over Cithaeron on a chariot with a numerous train amid the singing of marriage hymns. Heré, in her jealousy, threw herself upon her supposed rival, but, on discovering the trick, reconciled herself, with laughter, to Zeus, took her seat on the chariot, and founded the festival in memory of the incident. The feast was celebrated every seven years by the Plataeans alone and called the Little Daedala. But every sixtieth year all the cities of the Boeotian federation kept it as the Great Daedala. At the Little Daedala, guided by the note of a bird, they fixed on a tree in a grove of oaks and cut a figure out of it, which they dressed in bridal attire and took, as in marriage procession, to the top of Cithaeron. Here they offered a goat to Zeus and a cow to Heré, and burned the image with the offering. At the Great Daedala the images made at the Little Daedala were distributed by lot among the cities of the Boeotian confederacy, and the same proceedings were then repeated (Pausan. ix. 3. 1, etc.).

<div2 id="crossdaedalus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Daedălus">Daedalus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δαίδαλος</foreign>, “cunning artificer”). The mythical Greek representative of all handiwork, especially of Attic and Cretan art. As such he was worshipped by the artists' guilds, especially in Attica. He is said to have been the son of the Athenian Metion, son of Eupalamus (the ready-handed), and grandson of Erechtheus. He was supposed to <figure id="fig.00464">
<head orig="Daedalus and Icarus. (Rome, Villa Albani.)">Daedalus and Icarus. (Rome, Villa Albani.)</head>
</figure> have been the first artist who represented the human figure with open eyes, and feet and arms in motion. Besides being an excellent architect, he was said to have invented many implements— the axe, for instance, the awl, and the bevel. His own nephew Talus (son of his sister Perdix) appeared likely to surpass him in readiness and <cb /> originality. The invention of the saw, which he copied from the jawbone of a snake, of the potter's wheel, of the turning-lathe, of the axe, of the plumbline, of glue, of the gimlet, and of other things of this kind, was attributed to him. Daedalus was so jealous of him that he threw him from the Acropolis; and, being detected in the act of burying the body, was condemned by the Areopagus, and fled to Crete to King Minos. Here, among other things, he made the labyrinth at Gnosus for the Minotaur. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslabyrinthus">Labyrinthus</ref>.) He and his son Icarus were themselves confined in it, because he had given <ref type="cross" target="crossariadne">Ariadné</ref> (q.v.) the clue with which she guided Theseus through the maze. But the father and son succeeded in escaping, and fled over the sea upon wings of wax feathers made by Daedalus. Icarus, however, approached too near to the sun, so that the wax melted, and he fell into the sea and was drowned. The sea was called after him the Icarian, and the island on which his body was thrown up and buried by Heracles was called Icaria. Daedalus went to Camicus in Sicily, to King Cocalus, whose daughter loved him for his art, and slew Minos, who came in pursuit of him. He was supposed to have died in Sicily, where buildings attributed to him were shown in many places, as also in Sardinia, Egypt, and Italy, particularly at Cumae. In Greece a number of ancient wooden images were supposed to be his work—in particular a statue of Heracles at Thebes, which Daedalus was said to have made in gratitude for the burial of Icarus. Besides Icarus, Daedalus had a second son, Iapyx, said to be the founder of the Iapyges. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdaedala">Daedala</ref>.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossdaemon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Daemon">Daemon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δαίμων</foreign>). Originally a term applied to deity in general, manifested in its active relation to human life, without special reference to any single divine personality. But as early as Hesiod the daemones appear as subordinates or servants of the higher gods. He gives the name especially to the spirits of the past age of gold, who are appointed to watch over men and guard them. In later times, too, the daemones were regarded as beings intermediate between the gods and mankind, forming, as it were, the retinue of the gods, representing their powers in activity, and intrusted with the fulfilment of their various functions. This was the relation, to take an instance, which the Satyrs and Sileni bore to Dionysus. But the popular belief varied in regard to these deities.</p>
 <p>Another kind of daemones are those attached to individual men, attending them, like the Roman <seg lang="la">genius</seg> (q. v.), from birth to death. In later times two attendant daemones were assumed for every one; but this feeling was not universal, both good and evil being regarded as emanating at different times from the same daemon. The good spirit who gave rural prosperity and presided over vineyards (a sort of Hellenic brownie or Robin Goodfellow) was called Agathodaemon (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγαθοδαίμων</foreign>).</p>

<head orig="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δαλματία</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Delmatia.</hi> A part of the country along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, included under the general name of Illyricum, and separated from Liburnia on the north by the Titius (Kerka), and from Greek Illyria on the south by the Drilo (Drino), thus nearly corresponding to the modern Dalmatia. The capital was Dalminium or Delminium, from which the country derived its name. The next most important town was Salona, the residence of Diocletian. The Dalmatians were a brave and warlike people and gave much trouble to the Romans. In B.C. 119, their country was overrun by L. Metellus, who assumed, in consequence, the surname Dalmaticus, but they continued independent of the Romans. In B.C. 39, they were defeated by Asinius Pollio, of whose Dalmatic triumph Horace speaks; but it was not till the year 23 that they were finally subdued by Statilius Taurus. They took part in the great Pannonian revolt under their leader Bato ; but after a three years' war were again reduced to subjection by Tiberius, in A.D. 9.

He commenced his studies under Ammonius at Alexandria, and completed them at Athens under Marinus, Isidorus, and Zenodotus. According to some, he was the successor of Isidorus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δαμασκός</foreign>; in Hebrew, Dammesek; in Arabic, Dimeshk-es-Sham). One of the principal cities of Syria, in what was called Coelé-Syria, a few miles to the east of Antilibanus, where the chain begins to turn off to the southeast, under the name of Carmel. It is beautifully situated in an extensive and pleasant plain, and watered by a river called by the Greeks Bardiné or Chrysorrhoas, “the golden stream,” now Barada. The Biblical name of this stream was Abana. Damascus is supposed to have been founded by Uz, the eldest son of Aram (Gen. x. 23). However this <figure id="fig.00465">

 may be, it existed in the time of Abraham, and may be reckoned one of the most ancient cities of Syria. It was conquered by David (2 <bibl n="App. Sam. 8. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> Sam.viii. 6</bibl>), but freed itself from the Jewish yoke in the time of Solomon (1 Kings, xi. 23 foll.), and became the seat of a new principality, which often harassed the kingdoms of both Judah and Israel. It afterwards fell, in succession, under the power of the Assyrians and the Persians, and came from the latter into the hands of the Seleucidae. Damascus, however, did not flourish much under the Greek dynasty, as it had while held by the Persians. The Seleucidae neglected the place, and bestowed all their favour on the new cities erected by them in the northern parts of Syria; and here, no doubt, lies the reason why the later Greek and Roman writers say so little of the city itself, though they are all loud in their praises of the adjacent country. Damascus was seized by the Romans in the war of Pompey with Tigranes, B.C. 65, but still continued, as under the Greek dynasty, a comparatively unimportant place until the time of Diocletian. This emperor, feeling the necessity of a strongly fortified city in this quarter, as a dépôt for munitions of war and a military post against the frequent inroads of the Saracens, selected Damascus for the purpose. Everything was done, accordingly, to strengthen the place; extensive magazines were also established, and likewise numerous workshops for the preparation of weapons of war. It is not unlikely that the high reputation to which Damascus afterwards attained for its manufacture of sword-blades and other works in steel, may have had its first foundations laid by this arrangement on the part of Diocletian. The city continued from this time to be a flourishing place. In the seventh century it fell into the hands of the Saracens, and was for some time after this the seat of the califs. Its prosperity, too, remained unimpaired, since the route of the principal caravans to Mecca lay through it. It was sacked by Tamerlane, and finally became subject to the Turks. <figure id="fig.00466">

<head orig="Damnum">Damnum</head>

 <p> A Latin term which signifies loss or injury of any kind; but in its particular sense means loss or injury which a person has sustained in his property. Damnum in this particular sense may include loss of gain which a person is prevented from realizing (<seg lang="la">lúcrum cessans</seg>), as well as loss of actually acquired property (<seg lang="la">damnum emergens</seg>). The causes of damnum are either chance, accident (<seg lang="la">casus</seg>), or acts or omissions of reasonable human beings for which they are held to be responsible. As a rule no liability arises out of loss or injury to property caused by accident. <title>Dolus malus</title> or <seg lang="la">culpa</seg>—i. e. wilful or negligent misconduct on the part of the person committing damnum—is, as a rule, necessary in order to constitute liability; but in exceptional cases a person may be liable, although neither <seg lang="la">dolus malus</seg> nor <seg lang="la">culpa</seg> can be imputed to him. A wrongful act by which damnum is caused may be either an independent delict, or the breach of some special duty to which a person has become subject as a breach of contract. The liability to make good a loss which another has suffered is <seg lang="la">praestare damnum.</seg> A person liable for damages is, as a rule, bound to put the injured party in the same position as he would have been in if the act by which the damage was done had not been committed. He may also be subject to a penalty.

 <p> A term used in Roman law to denote damage not actually done, but apprehended on account of the dangerous condition of neighbouring property. If proceedings were not taken before damage had been done, the injured party had no action for damages subsequently; if, e. g. a ruinous house (<seg lang="la">aedes ruinosae</seg>) fell and damaged a neighbour before a <seg lang="la">cautio</seg> had been demanded, all the right that the damaged person had was to retain the materials that had fallen on his land (<title>Dig.</title> 39, 2, 6. 7. 2. 8). Gaius states that a party who apprehended damage might have recourse to a <seg lang="la">legis actio</seg> in order to protect himself, but that the <seg lang="la">stipulatio damni infecti</seg> provided by the praetor in his edict for such cases was always sought as being the more convenient remedy (<bibl n="Gaius  4. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Gaius, iv. 31</bibl>).

Dionysius, the tyrant, having condemned Phintias to death for conspiring against him, the latter begged that leave might be allowed him to go for a short period to a neighbouring place, in order to arrange some family affairs, and offered to leave one of his friends in the hands of Dionysius as a pledge for his return by an appointed time, and who would be willing, in case Phintias broke his word, to die in his stead. Dionysius, sceptical as to the existence of such friendship, and prompted by curiosity, assented to the arrangement, and Damon took the place of Phintias. The day appointed for the return of the latter arrived, and public expectation was highly excited as to the probable issue of this singular affair. The day drew to a close; no Phintias came; and Damon was in the act of being led to execution, when, of a sudden, the absent friend, who had been detained by unforeseen and unavoidable obstacles, presented himself to the eyes of the admiring crowd and saved the life of Damon.

<head orig="Danaë">Danae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δανάη</foreign>). (1) The daughter of Acrisius, king of Argos, by Eurydicé, daughter of Lacedaemon. Acrisius inquired of the oracle about a son; and the god replied that he would himself have no male issue, but that his daughter would bear a son, whose hand would deprive him of life. Fearing the accomplishment of this prediction, he framed a brazen subterranean chamber, in which he shut up his daughter and her nurse, in order that she might never become a mother. (The <cb /> Latin poets call the place of confinement a brazen tower.) But Zeus had seen and loved the maiden; and, under the form of a golden shower, he poured through the roof into her bosom. Danaë became, in consequence, the mother of a son, whom she and her nurse reared in secrecy until he had attained his fourth year. Acrisius then chanced to hear the voice of the child at play. He brought out his daughter and her nurse, and, putting the latter instantly to death, drew Danaë privately, with her child, to the altar of Hercean Zeus, where he made her answer on oath whose was her son. She replied that he was the offspring of Zeus. Her father gave no credit to her protestations. Enclosing her and the boy in a coffer, he cast them into the sea, at the mercy of the winds and waves, a circumstance which has afforded a subject for a beautiful lyric by the poet Simonides. The coffer was carried to the little island of Seriphus, where a person named Dictys drew it out in his nets (<foreign lang="greek">δίκτυα</foreign>); and, freeing Danaë and Perseus from their confinement, treated them with the greatest kindness. Polydectes, the brother of Dictys, reigned over the island. He fell in love with Danaë; but her son Perseus, who was now grown up, was an invincible obstacle in his way. He had, therefore, recourse to artifice to deliver himself of his presence; and, feigning that he was about to become a suitor to Hippodamia, the daughter of Oenomaüs, he managed to send Perseus, who had bound himself by a rash promise, in quest of the head of the Medusa, which he pretended that he wished for a bridal gift. When Perseus had succeeded, by the aid of Hermes, in slaying the Gorgon , he proceeded to Seriphus, where he found that his mother and Dictys had been obliged to fly to the protection of the altar from the violence of Polydectes. He immediately went to the royal residence; and when, at his desire, Polydectes had summoned thither all the people to see the head of the Gorgon , it was displayed, and each became a stone of the form and position which he exhibited at the moment of the transformation. Having established Dictys as king of Seriphus, Perseus returned with his mother to Argos; and, not finding Acrisius there, proceeded to Larissa in Thessaly, whither the latter had retired through fear of the fulfilment of the oracle. Here he inadvertently killed Acrisius. See <ref type="cross" target="crossacrisius">Acrisius</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossperseus">Perseus</ref>.</p>
 <p>There was a legend in Italy that Ardea, the capital of the Rutulians, had been founded by Danaë ( <bibl n="Verg.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δαναός</foreign>). A son of Belus and Anchinoë, and brother of Aegyptus. Belus assigned the country of Libya to Danaüs, while to Aegyptus he gave Arabia. Aegyptus conquered the country of the Melampodes and named it from himself. By many wives he became the father of fifty sons. Danaüs had by several wives an equal number of daughters. Dissension arising between him and the sons of Aegyptus, they aimed at depriving him of his kingdom; and, fearing their violence, he built, with the aid of Athené, a fifty-oared vessel, the first that ever was made, in which he embarked with his daughters and fled over the sea. He first landed on the isle of Rhodes, where he set up a statue of the Lindian Athené; but, not caring to remain in that island, he proceeded to Argos; where Gelanor, who at that time ruled over the country, cheerfully resigned the government to the stranger who had brought thither civilization and the arts. The people took the name of their new monarch, and were called Danaï (<foreign lang="greek">Δαναοί</foreign>). The country of Argos being at this time extremely deficient in pure and wholesome water (see <ref type="cross" target="crossinachus">Inachus</ref>), Danaüs sent forth his daughters in quest of some. As Amymoné, one of them, was engaged in the search, she was rescued by Poseidon from the intended violence of a satyr, and the god revealed to her a fountain called after her name and the most famous among the streams that contributed to form the Lernaean lake or marsh. The sons of Aegyptus came now to Argolis and entreated their uncle to bury past enmity in oblivion, and to give them their cousins in marriage. Danaüs, retaining a perfect recollection of the injuries they had done him and distrustful of their promises, consented to bestow upon them his daughters, whom he divided among them by lot; but on the wedding-day he armed the hands of the brides with daggers, and en<figure id="fig.00468">

All but Hypermnestra obeyed the cruel orders of their father; and cutting off the heads of their husbands, they flung them into Lerna, and buried their bodies with all due rites outside of the town. At the command of Zeus, Hermes and Athené purified them from the guilt of their deed. Hypermnestra had spared Lynceus for the delicate regard which he had shown to her modesty. Her father, at first, in his anger at her disobedience, put her into close confinement. Relenting, however, after some time, he gave his consent to her union with Lynceus, and proclaimed gymnastic games, in which the victors were to receive his other daughters as the prizes. It was said, however, that the crime of the Danaïdes did not pass without due punshment in the lower world, where they were condemned to pour water forever into a perforated vessel.

But Polematas, the general of the Boeotians, had a vision in which he saw a young man who presented to him a complete suit of armour, and who made him vow to institute a festival, to be celebrated every ninth year, in honour of Apollo, at which the Thebans, with laurel-boughs in their hands, were to go to his temple.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δάρδανος</foreign>). (1) The son of Zeus and Electra, the mythical ancestor of the Trojans, and through them of the Romans. The Greek traditions usually made him a king in Arcadia, from whence he emigrated first to Samothrace, and afterwards to Asia, where he received a tract of land from King Teucer, on which he built the town of Dardania. His grandson Tros removed to Troy the Palladium, which had belonged to his grandfather.

<head orig="Dares">Dares</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δάρης</foreign>). (1) A Trojan priest, mentioned by Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5. 9" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>v. 9</bibl>). It is absurdly pretended, by some of the ancient writers, that he wrote an <title>Iliad</title>, or history of the Trojan War, in prose; and Aelian (<title>Var. Hist.</title> xi. 2) assures us that it still existed in his day, without telling us, however, whether he <cb /> himself had read it or not. There can, of course, be no doubt that Aelian was deceived, and that the work which he took for the production of Dares was the composition of some sophist of a much later age. However this may be, the <title>Iliad</title> of which Aelian speaks no longer exists; but we have a Latin work remaining, written in prose, which was for some time regarded as a translation from the Greek original, and was ascribed to Cornelius Nepos, though abounding with absurdities and solecisms. It is entitled <title>Historia Excidii Troiae</title>, or <title>De Excidio Troiae.</title> It professes to be dedicated to the historian</p>
 <p>This work, together with that of Dictys Cretensis (q. v.) forms the original source of a famous romance of chivalry, which met with extraordinary success during the Middle Ages, and in the centuries immediately subsequent to the invention of printing. These works of Dares and Dictys having fallen into the hands of a Sicilian named Guido delle Colonne, a native of Messina, and a celebrated lawyer and poet of the thirteenth century, he conceived the idea of giving them that romantic air which would harmonize with the spirit of his age, when chivalry had acquired its greatest lustre. He consequently interpolated the narratives of the pretended poets of Phrygia and Crete with various adventures, suited to the taste of the time, such as tournaments, challenges, and single combats. His work having met with considerable success, he composed, in Latin prose, a romance of the war of Troy, into which he also introduced the war of the Seven against Thebes and the expedition of the Argonauts. He confounds together history and mythology, Greek and Oriental manners; his heroes are acquainted with alchemy and astronomy, and come into conflict with dragons, griffins, and other fabulous monsters. His romance was translated into almost every European language, and excited a general enthusiasm. Hence the desire which at that time seized the great families of Europe of claiming descent from one of the heroes of Trojan story; and hence the eagerness, on the part of the monks, to compose genealogies consisting of Greek and Roman names which had some analogy with the names of the sovereign princes of the Middle Ages. This same work of Dares Phrygius was the source whence Conrad of Würzburg, in the latter half of the thirteenth century, derived the materials of the poem which he composed in like manner on the war of Troy.</p>
 <p>The oldest MS. of the <title>Historia de Excidio Troiae</title> is one at Paris, of the ninth century, and other MSS. are those of St. Gall, Bern, Bamberg, and Vienna. The work is at least as early as Isidorus, who mentions it ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 1. 41" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>i. 41</bibl>).

<div2 id="crossdaricus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Darīcus">Daricus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">στατὴρ δαρεικός</foreign>). A daric; the gold coin which constituted for centuries, until the time of Alexander the Great, the main part of the coinage 
<pb n="470" /><cb /> of Asia under Persian dominion. Gold darics are to be found in all great museums; their type is on the obverse a crowned archer kneeling, on the reverse a mere rude incuse; their weight is about 130 grains, and their intrinsic value about $5.40 of our money. In allusion to their type they were sometimes called <foreign lang="greek">τόξοται</foreign>; whence the saying of Agesilaüs ( <bibl n="Plut. Ages. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Ages.</title>15</bibl>) that he had been driven from Asia by 30,000 archers, when his recall was the result of Persian bribery at Athens and Thebes.</p>
 <p>The Greeks connected the word <foreign lang="greek">δαρεικός</foreign>. with the name of Darius Hystaspis, to whom they attributed the first issue of these coins. This derivation, however, is certainly erroneous. Not only is there small likeness in sound between the name of the coin and that of the king in their Persian forms, but we learn from the Book of Ezra (ii. 69; viii. 27) that darics were in circulation in Palestine in the time of Cyrus; and M. Bertin has found the word <hi rend="italic">dariku</hi> on a tablet of the reign of Nabonidus, which is still earlier (<title>Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch.</title> 1883- 1884, p. 87; cf. Head, <title>Historia Numorum</title>, p. 698). Of course in the cases just cited, though we have a complete proof of the great antiquity of the word <hi rend="italic">daric</hi>, we cannot be sure whether a fixed weight of gold or a coin is intended. The probability is that the nations of the Euphrates valley did not coin money until they had conquered Lydia and Ionia in the time of Cyrus. Darius, Herodotus tells us, issued gold coin of great fineness ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 166" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 166</bibl>); and this may have caused the Greeks to suppose that he issued the earliest Persian coins. The abundance of the darics in circulation in Asia Minor in the days of Xerxes is shown by the wellknown story of Pythius the Lydian ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 28</bibl>), who possessed four millions of them. <figure id="fig.00470">

 <p>Besides the gold darics there circulated silver coins of the same shape and bearing the same device of the archer; these were commonly known as the <foreign lang="greek">σίγλος</foreign> or shekel, but were sometimes termed silver darics ( <title>Cimon</title>, 10). These were of the value of about $0.27.

<head orig="Darīus">Darius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δαρεῖος</foreign>; <title>Dâryavas</title>). (1) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Hystaspis</hi> (or son of Hystaspes), a satrap of Persia, born B.C. 548, and belonging to the royal line of the Achaemenides. His father Hystaspes had been governor of the province of Persia. Seven noblemen of the highest rank, among whom was Darius, conspired to dethrone the Magian <ref type="cross" target="crosssmerdis">Smerdis</ref> (q.v.), who had usurped the crown after the death of Cambyses, and, having accomplished their object (B.C. 521), resolved that one of their number should reign in his stead. According to Herodotus <cb /> (<bibl n="Hdt. 3.84" default="NO" valid="yes">iii. 84</bibl>), they agreed to meet at early dawn in the suburbs of the capital, and that he of their number whose horse should first neigh at the rising of the sun should possess the kingdom. If we believe the historian, who gives two accounts of the matter, Darius obtained the crown through an artful contrivance on the part of his groom. It is more probable, however, that, in consequence of his relationship to the royal line, his election to the throne was the unanimous act of the other conspirators. It is certain, indeed, that they reserved for themselves privileges which tended at least to make them independent of the monarch, and even to keep him dependent upon them. One of their number is said to have formally stipulated for absolute exemption from the royal authority, as the condition on which he withdrew his claim to the crown; and the rest acquired the right of access to the king's person at all seasons, without asking his leave, and bound him to select his wives exclusively from their families. How far the power of Darius, though nominally despotic, was really limited by these privileges of his nobles, may be seen from an occurrence which took place in the early part of his reign, in the case of Intaphernes, who had been one of the partners in the conspiracy. He revenged himself, it is true, for an outrage committed by this individual, by putting him to death; but before he ventured to take this step, he thought it necessary to sound the other four, and to ascertain whether they would make common cause with the offender.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Darius was the greatest and most powerful king that ever filled the throne of Persia. Cyrus and Cambyses had conquered nations; Darius was the true founder of the Persian State. The dominions of his predecessors were a mass of countries only united by their subjection to the will of a common ruler, which expressed itself by arbitrary and irregular exactions. Darius first organized them into an empire, of which every member felt its place and knew its functions. His realm stretched from the Aegean to the Indus, from the steppes of Scythia to the Cataracts of the Nile. He divided this vast tract into twenty satrapies or provinces, and prescribed the tribute which each was to pay to the royal treasury, and the proportion in which they were to supply provisions for the army and for the king's household. A highway, on which distances were regularly marked and spacious buildings placed to receive all who travelled in the king's name, connected the western coast with the seat of government; and along this road couriers trained to extraordinary speed transmitted the king's messages. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscursus-publicus">Cursus Publicus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspersia">Persia</ref>.</p>
 <p>Darius, in the very beginning of his reign, meditated an expedition against the Scythians to check their incursions for all time to come by a salutary display of the power and resources of the Persian Empire. His march, however, was delayed by a rebellion which broke out at Babylon. The ancient capital of Assyria had been secretly preparing for revolt during the troubles that followed the fall of Smerdis, and for nearly two years it defied the power of Darius. At length the strategy of Zopyrus, a noble Persian, who sacrificed his person and his power to the interest of his master, is said to have opened its gates to him (circa B.C. 516). When he was freed from this care he set out for the Scythian war (B.C. 513 or 508).

</figure></p>
 <p>The whole military force of the Empire was put in motion, and the numbers of the army are rated at seven or eight hundred thousand men. This expedition of Darius into Scythia has given rise to considerable discussion. The first point involved is to ascertain how far the Persian monarch penetrated into the country. According to Herodotus (iv. 83), he crossed the Thracian Bosporus, marched through Thrace, passed the Danube on a bridge of boats, and then pursued a Scythian division as far as the Tanaïs. Having crossed this river, he traversed the territories of the Sauromatae as far as the Budini, whose city he burned. Beyond the Budini he entered upon a vast desert, and reached the river Oarus, where he remained some considerable time, erecting forts upon its banks. Finding that the Scythians had disappeared, he left these works only half finished, turned his course to the westward, and, advancing by rapid marches, entered Scythia, where he fell in with two of the divisions of the enemy. Pursuing these, he traversed the territories of the Melanchlaeni, Androphagi, and Neuri, without being able to bring them to an engagement. Provisions failing, he was eventually compelled to recross the Danube (see <hi rend="SmallCaps">Histiaeus</hi>), glad to have saved a small portion of his once numerous army. According to other accounts ( <bibl n="Strab.  305" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.305</bibl>), Darius only came as far as the sandy tract between the Danube and the Tyrus, in the present Bessarabia, where, in afterdays, Antigonus was taken prisoner by the Scythians, with his whole army.</p>
 <p>Another expedition undertaken by command of Darius was an invasion of India ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 44</bibl>), the date, however, being doubtful. In this affair he was more successful, and conquered a part of the Punjab; not, however, the whole country, as some modern writers erroneously represent.</p>
 <p>Some time after this, Miletus having revolted, and Aristagoras, its ruler, having solicited aid from the Athenians for the purpose of enabling it to maintain <cb /> its independence, they sent twenty ships, to which the Eretrians added five more, in order to requite a kindness previously received from the Milesians. Aristagoras, upon the arrival of this fleet, resolved to make an expedition against Sardis, the residence of the Persian satrap. Accordingly, landing at Ephesus, the confederates marched inland, took Sardis, and drove the governor into the citadel. Most of the houses in Sardis were made of reeds, and even those that were built of brick were roofed with reeds. One of these was set on fire by a soldier, and immediately the flames spread from house to house and consumed the whole city. The light of the conflagration showing to the Greeks the great numbers of their opponents, who were beginning to rally, being constrained by necessity to defend themselves, as their retreat was cut off by the river Pactolus, the former retired through fear and regained their ships (B.C. 501). Upon the receipt of this entelligence, Darius, having called for a bow, put an arrow into it, and shot it into the air, with these words, “Grant, O God, that I may be able to revenge myself upon the Athenians.” After he had thus spoken, he commanded one of his attendants thrice every time dinner was set before him, to exclaim, “Master! remember the Athenians.” Mardonius, the king's son-in-law, was intrusted with the care of the war. After crossing the Hellespont, he marched down through Thrace, but, in endeavouring to double Mount Athos, he lost 300 vessels and, it is said, more than 20,000 men (B.C. 492). After this he was attacked in the night by the Brygi, who killed many of his men and wounded Mardonius himself. He succeeded, however, in defeating and reducing them to subjection, but his army was so weakened by these circumstances that he was compelled to return ingloriously to Asia. Darius, only animated by this loss, sent a more considerable force, under the command of Datis and Artaphernes, with orders to sack the cities of Athens and Eretria, and to send to him all the surviving inhabitants in fetters. The Persians took the isle of Naxos and the city of Eretria in Euboea, but were defeated with great slaughter by the Athenians and Plataeans under the celebrated Miltiades at Marathon (B.C. 490). Their fleet was also completely unsuccessful in an attempt to surprise Athens after the battle. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmiltiades">Miltiades</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmarathon">Marathon</ref>.) The anger of Darius was doubly inflamed <figure id="fig.00471.2">
<head orig="Cuneiform and Hieroglyphical Forms of “Darius.”">Cuneiform and Hieroglyphical Forms of “Darius.”</head>
</figure> against Athens by the result at Marathon; and he resolved that the insolent people, who had invaded his territories, violated the persons of his messengers, and put his generals to a shameful flight, should feel the whole weight of his arm.</p>
 <p>The preparations he now set on foot were on a vast scale and demanded a longer time. For three years all Asia was kept in a continual stir; in the 
<pb n="472" /><cb />
 fourth, however, Darins was distracted by other causes—by a quarrel between his two sons respecting the succession to the throne, and by an insurrection in Egypt. In the following year, before he had ended his preparations against Egypt and Attica, he died, and <ref type="cross" target="crossxerxes">Xerxes</ref> (q.v.) ascended the throne, in B.C. 485. Darius had reigned for thirtysix years. His memory was always held in veneration by the Persians and the other nations comprehended under his sway, whom he governed with much wisdom and moderation.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The second of the name was styled <foreign lang="greek">Ὦχος</foreign>. See <ref type="cross" target="crossochus">Ochus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscyrus">Cyrus</ref></p>
 <p>(2).
 </p>
 <p>(3) The third of the name, and the last king of Persia, was son of Arsames, who had for his father Osthames, one of the sons of Darius Ochus. His true name was Codomannus, and he had, before coming to the throne, acquired some reputation for personal courage, chiefly through an exploit which he had performed in one of the expeditions against the Cadusians, when he accepted a challenge from one of their stoutest warriors, and slew him in single combat. The eunuch <ref type="cross" target="crossbagoas">Bagoas</ref> (q.v.) raised him to the throne, not so much, however, on this account, as because they had previously been friends, and because, perhaps, there was no other prince of the blood on whose gratitude he could safely rely. Codomannus, upon his accession (B.C. 336), which took place about the time when Philip of Macedon died, assumed the name of Darius. He soon discovered that Bagoas, who may have intended at length to seize the throne himself, designed that he should share the fate of his last two predecessors. A cup of poison had been prepared for him. But, having detected the plot, he called Bagoas into his presence and compelled him to drink the deadly draught.</p>
 <p>The reign of Darius Codomannus was early disturbed by the invasion of Alexander. The Persian monarch, however, did not take the command of his forces until after the battle of the Granicus had been fought (334), and Alexander had advanced as far as Cilicia. He then proceeded to meet the invader, in all the pomp of royalty, but with an army ill fitted to contend against such an antagonist. Resolving to hazard an encounter, contrary to the advice of his Greek allies, Darius engaged in the battle of Issus, but was compelled to flee from the field with so much precipitation as to leave behind him his bow, shield, and royal mantle (333). His camp was plundered, and his mother, wife, and children fell into the hands of the conqueror. In vain, after this, did Darius supplicate for terms of peace. Alexander went on in his career of victory; and in a second pitched battle at Gaugamela, commonly called the battle of <ref type="cross" target="crossarbela">Arbela</ref> (q.v.), Darius again fought, and again was compelled to flee (331). His plan was now to advance into Media, lay waste the country through which he passed, and seek refuge finally on the other side of the Oxus, where he hoped that the conqueror would be content to leave him unmolested. Alexander allowed four months to elapse before he again set out in pursuit of Darius. He then advanced by forced marches in pursuit of him, and learned eventually that the monarch was a prisoner in the hands of <ref type="cross" target="crossbessus">Bessus</ref> (q.v.), one of his own satraps. A still more active pursuit now commenced, and the unhappy king, refusing to proceed any farther, was left mortally wounded in a chariot, while Bessus and his accomplices took to flight, accompanied by 600 horse. <cb /> Darius expired before Alexander saw him (B.C. 330).</p>
 <p>Alexander ordered his body to be buried in the sepulchre of his ancestors with royal magnificence, took charge of the education of his children, and married his daughter ( <title>Alex.;</title> Arrian, <title>Exp. Al.</title>).

They remained masters of Athens till the party of Thrasybulus obtained possession of the city and the democracy was restored; and, like the Thirty, were excepted from the amnesty, but allowed to retire into banishment.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δεκασμός</foreign>) Bribery; strictly meaning a systematic bribery by division into sets of ten. There were two actions for bribery at Athens—one, called <foreign lang="greek">δεκασμοῦ γραφή</foreign>, lay against the person who gave the bribe; and the other, called <foreign lang="greek">δώρων</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δωροδοκίας γραφή</foreign>, against the person who received it (Pollux, viii. 42). These actions applied to the bribery of citizens in the public assemblies of the people, of the Heliaea or any of the courts of justice, of the <foreign lang="greek">βουλή</foreign>, and of the public advocates (<foreign lang="greek">συνηγόροι</foreign>). Demosthenes, indeed, says that orators were forbidden by the law, not merely to abstain from receiving gifts for the injury of the State, but even to receive any present at all.</p>
 <p>Actions for bribery were under the jurisdiction of the thesmothetae. The punishment on conviction was death (Isocr. <title>De Pace</title>. 50) or payment of ten times the value of the gift received (Dinarch. <title>c. Demosth.</title> 60). An additional punishment (<foreign lang="greek">προστίμημα</foreign>) might be inflicted by the court; as in the case of Demosthenes, who was not only fined fifty talents, but thrown into prison ( <title>Demosth.</title> 26).

 <p> (1) The First Ten of the Roman Senate were originally the heads of the decuries into which the Senate of one hundred was divided. They took the office of interrex by turns, and are mentioned in that capacity at the first interregnum, on the death of Romulus ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 17</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 57" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 57</bibl>). When subsequently the representatives of the Tities and Luceres were admitted into the Senate, the Ramnes with their Decem Primi retained for some time their precedence over the other two tribes and gave their votes first ( <bibl n="Plut. Num. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Num.</title>3</bibl>; <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 58" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 58</bibl>; iii. 1). The first in rank among them was the <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg>, who was appointed by the king, and was at the same time <seg lang="la">custos urbis</seg> ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 12" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 12</bibl>; I. Lydus, <title>De Mens.</title> i. 19). In the early republican period the Decem Primi seem to have been the consulars of the greater houses in order of seniority, then those of the lesser houses.</p>
 <p>When the censors acquired the power of nominating the senators from among qualified persons, the Decem Primi were simply the first ten named by them; this choice was usually exercised according to merit, and a man who was generally acknowledged as the first Roman of his time was tolerably 
<pb n="474" /><cb /> certain to become <seg lang="la">princeps senatus</seg> and to retain the dignity for life. Valerius Corvus, the two Fabii Maximi, Rullianus and Cunctator, L. Aemilius Paullus, and the two Africani, all seem to have enjoyed this honour. The censors were often partial and passionate in the exercise of their almost irresponsible authority; but even the memorable quarrel between Livius Salinator and Claudius Nero did not prevent their giving the first place in the Senate to Fabius Cunctator ( <bibl n="Liv.  29. 37. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxix. 37. 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) In municipal senates we constantly find a committee, generally of ten, sometimes of a greater or less number, chosen (apparently by the decurions themselves) out of the larger body. In Italy this institution can be traced very far back; we find it in Latium as early as the great Latin War of B.C. 340 ( <bibl n="Liv.  8. 3. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.viii. 3. 8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) Wherever there was an <seg lang="la">ordo</seg>, Roman organization seems to have involved the appointment of ten, or sometimes six, primi. Below the senatorian rank we find them among <seg lang="la">apparitores, lictores</seg>, and <seg lang="la">praecones;</seg> in priestly colleges (<title>C. I. L.</title> vi. 2010); and among the <seg lang="la">domestici</seg> or body-guards of the later Empire (<title>Cod. Theod.</title> vi. 24).

<head orig="Decemvĭri">Decemviri</head>

 <p> (1) Ten commissioners appointed (B.C. 451) to frame a code of laws for the Roman State at a time when the feuds between the patricians and plebeians were continuing with unabated animosity. Occasionally one of the consuls favoured the plebeians, and proposed some mitigation of the hardships under which they were labouring, or some increase of their privileges, but generally with little success. The Agrarian Law, brought forward by Spurius Cassius, continued to be the main demand of the commons and their supporters, but its passage was, on every occasion, either directly or indirectly prevented. At last the commons became convinced that they need hope for no complete redress of grievances until they should have previously secured the establishment of some constitutional principle, from which equal justice would, of necessity and from its very nature, emanate. Accordingly, Terentillus HarsaGaius , one of the tribunes, proposed a law (B.C. 462) for a reform of the existing state of things. Its purport was that ten commissioners should be chosen, five by the patricians and five by the plebeians, to draw up a constitution, which should define all points of constitutional, civil, and criminal law; and should thus determine, on just and fixed principles, all the political, social, and civil relations of all orders of the Roman people. After much opposition on the part of the patricians, the law was passed, and three commissioners were at length sent to Greece, to collect from the Grecian States such notices of their laws and constitutions as might be serviceable to the Romans. After the absence of a year they returned; and the plebeians, finding it in vain to insist upon five of their own body forming part of the reviewers of the laws, yielded the point, and ten of the most distinguished of the patrician and senatorial body were chosen to form an entirely new and complete code of laws by which the State should be governed. They were named <title>Decemviri</title>, “the ten men” (<title>Decemviri Legibus Scribendis</title>), and during their office they were to supersede every other magistrate. Each in his turn was to administer the government for a day, <cb /> or, according to others, for several days, till they should complete their legislative labours. After the careful deliberation of a few months, the result was laid before the people in the form of ten tables, fully written out, and exhibited in a conspicuous place where all might read them. Various amendments were proposed, and the ten tables again laid before the Senate, the curiae, and the centuries, and, having received the sanction of both orders of the State, were recognized as the very fountain of the laws, public and private. The Decemvirs had conducted matters so much to the satisfaction of the community that when, at the expiration of their year, they requested a renewal of their office, on the ground that they had still two more tables to form in order to complete their task, an election of new Decemvirs was ordered. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstwelve-tables">Twelve Tables</ref>.) The patrician Appius Claudius, who took the leading part in the whole affair, was nominated to preside over this election. He acted in concert with the plebeians, by receiving votes for plebeian candidates, and for himself likewise, though it had been declared contrary to law that any functionary should be re-elected immediately after holding office. By dint of intrigue, however, Appius was reelected, and along with him nine others, half of whom were patricians, half plebeians.</p>
 <p>The new commission soon showed itself very different from the first. Each of the Decemvirs had twelve lictors, whereas the previous commission had the lictors only by turns, and a single <seg lang="la">accensus</seg> or officer preceded each of the rest. The lictors, too, now bore amid the fasces the formidable axe, the emblem of judgment on life and death, which the consuls, since the time of Valerius Publicola, had been obliged to lay aside during their continuance in the city. The Decemvirs seemed resolved to change the government of Rome into a complete oligarchy, consisting of ten, whose power should be absolute in everything. They assumed the right of superseding all other magistracies; and, at the conclusion of their second year, they showed no intention of resigning their offices or of appointing their successors. Matters had nearly reached a crisis when a war arose, the Sabines and the Aequi having united their forces and being desirous of availing themselves of the distracted state of Rome. The Decemvirs assembled the Senate, obtained its authority to raise an army, at the head of which they placed three of their number, and sent it against the Sabines. Another was raised and sent against the Aequi, while Appius Claudius remained at Rome to provide for the safety of the city and for the maintenance of the power of the Decemvirs. Both armies were defeated, and retired nearer to the city, dissatisfied rather than discomfited. Then occurred the affair of Virginia, and the decemviral power was at an end. See <ref type="cross" target="crossclaudius">Claudius</ref></p>
 <p>(4); <ref type="cross" target="crossvirginia">Virginia;</ref> <bibl n="Liv.  3. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.iii. 32</bibl> foll.; and Mommsen, <title>Hist. of Rome</title>, vol. i. pp. 345-371 (Eng. trans.).
 </p>
 <p>(2) There were also military decemviri; and, on various emergencies, decemviri were created to manage and regulate certain affairs, after the same manner as boards of commissioners are now appointed. Thus there were decemviri for conducting colonies; decemviri who officiated as judges in litigated matters under the praetor; decemviri for dividing the lands among the veteran soldiers; decemviri to prepare and preside at feasts in honour 
<pb n="475" /><cb />
 of the gods; decemviri to take care of the sacrifices (<title>Decemviri Sacris Faciundis</title>) and to guard the Sibylline Books. With regard to the last of these, however, it must be observed that the number, after having been originally two, and then increased to ten, was subsequently still further increased to fifteen and sixteen.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Decennia.</hi> A festival celebrated with games every ten years by the Roman emperors.

The memory of this comedy, as Gibbon has called it, was preserved to the last ages of the Empire by the festival of the Decennalia, which was solemnized by subsequent emperors every tenth year of their reign, although they had received the <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> for life, and not for the limited period of ten years (Dio Cass. liii. 16; liv. 12; lviii. 24; lxxvi. 1).

 <p> The selection, by lot, of every tenth man for capital punishment, when any number of soldiers in the Roman army had been guilty of certain military offences—usually cowardice, loss of standards in action, or mutiny. This punishment is not often mentioned in the early times of the Republic; but the case of the consul Appius Claudius and his mutinous army (B.C. 471) is recorded both by Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 2.59" default="NO" valid="yes">ii. 59</bibl>) and Dionysius (ix. 50); the latter speaks of it as customary (<foreign lang="greek">πάτριος</foreign>) for the offences named. Polybius notices it as usual when troops had given way to panic; the remainder were punished by having rations of barley instead of wheat served out to them, and by being made to lodge outside the camp (vi. 38). When, however, Crassus employed decimation in the servile war of Spartacus, he is described as having revived an ancient punishment which had long fallen into disuse ( <bibl n="Plut.

This took place A.D. 249, and from this period is dated the commencement of the reign of Decius. It was one of short duration, about two years. During this time, however, he proved a very cruel persecutor of the Christians. He greatly signalized himself against the Persians, but was slain in an action with the Goths, who had invaded his dominions. In advancing upon them he was, with the greater part of his troops, entangled in a morass, where, being surrounded by the enemy, he perished under a shower of darts, A.D. 251, aged fifty years.

These were of two kinds: <seg lang="la">(a) suasoriae; (b) controversiae.</seg> The former were based upon some historical or legendary theme, and the pupil was required to treat some problem arising thence, as, for instance, whether Sulla should have resigned his dictatorship ( <bibl n="Juv.  1. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.i. 16</bibl>) or Cato have committed suicide ( <bibl n="Pers.  3. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iii. 45</bibl>). These were regarded as suitable for beginners, as not requiring any wide or minute knowledge of law ( <bibl n="Tac. Dial. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Dial.</title>35</bibl>). The latter dealt with legal questions, and took the form of the discussion of an imaginary case, such as might arise in the courts. Marcus <ref type="cross" target="crossseneca">Seneca</ref> (q.v.), the father of the philosopher, has left seven examples of <seg lang="la">suasoriae</seg>, thirty-five of <seg lang="la">controversiae</seg>, as well as ten books of <seg lang="la">excerpta controversiarum</seg>, which contain many interesting specimens of the kind of questions thus treated.

But, with the decline of free speech, the exercise sank into a mere occasion for display. The themes were hackneyed or extravagant, the language affected and full of strained antithesis and epigram (Quintil. viii. 3, 76; 5, 14, etc.); and what should have been a preparation for real life became an end in itself. The rage for declamation was at its height during the first century of the Empire. Quintilian's sober sense did much to check it; and though the practice did not wholly die out of the schools, it seems to have been confined within more reasonable limits. (Cf. Bernhardy, <title>Röm.

 <p><title>Decretum</title> is the technical term for the decision and order which a magistrate gives in a particular case after an inquiry into its circumstances (<seg lang="la">causae cognitio</seg>). A <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> is said <seg lang="la">condemnare</seg> not <seg lang="la">decernere;</seg> the latter word being appropriate in judicial proceedings to a magistrate who has <seg lang="la">iurisdictio.</seg> A decretum, as one of the kinds of imperial constitutions, was a judicial decision in a case before the emperor in his capacity of supreme magistrate; cases were brought into the imperial court (<seg lang="la">consistorium principis</seg>) by <seg lang="la">supplicationes</seg> or <seg lang="la">provocationes</seg> of suitors.</p>
 <p>The interpretations of law laid down by the emperor in his decreta were, as a rule, binding on all courts in subsequent cases.

 <p> (<seg lang="la">sc. pars</seg>). “A tithe.” This name was applied by the Romans to the tribute in kind, which Sicily, and at one time Asia Minor, had to pay out of the yearly production of wheat, wine, oil, and produce, instead of the <seg lang="la">stipendium</seg> usual in other provinces. It was a burden on the land called after it <seg lang="la">ager decumanus</seg>, and was exacted from the persons occupying at the time. Every year the number of cultivators, of acres under cultivation, and the produce of the harvest, were ascertained, and the right of exacting the <seg lang="la">decuma</seg> of the whole territory of a city sold to the highest bidder. In the case of Sicily this took place at Syracuse; in the case of Asia, in Rome. The purchaser of the decuma bound himself to deliver a certain quantity of corn in Rome; if the harvest were good, he found his advantage in the surplus. Such farmers of the decumae were called <seg lang="la">decumani.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspublicani">Publicanus</ref>.) If the amount delivered were insufficient for the needs of the city, a second amount could be extracted by decree of the Senate or the people, which was paid for by the State.

 <p>(2) A corresponding division of the Senate. The original hundred members of the Senate were divided into ten decuriae, the heads of each decuria forming the Decem Primi in the Senate. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecem-primi">Decem Primi</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssenatus">Senatus</ref>). In like manner in the municipal towns the Senate, usually called <seg lang="la">curia</seg>, was divided into decuriae. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecuriones">Decuriones</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(3) In the same way for military purposes each of the three Roman tribes was represented by 100 equites, called <seg lang="la">centuriae.</seg> The three <seg lang="la">centuriae</seg> were divided into ten <seg lang="la">turmae</seg>, each consisting of thirty men; every <seg lang="la">turma</seg> contained ten Ramnes, ten Tities, and ten Luceres, and each of these <seg lang="la">decuriae</seg> was commanded by a <seg lang="la">decurio</seg> ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 13</bibl>; Varr. <title>L.

 </p>
 <p>(4) The most important decuriones were those in the municipal towns, who are the subject of the following article.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossdecuriones" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Decuriōnes, Curiāles">Decuriones, Curiales</head>

 <p> In the constitution of the Italian towns (<seg lang="la">municipia, coloniae, praefecturae</seg>), as regulated by the Lex Iulia Municipalis, B.C. 45, each municipality was governed by an assembly of the <seg lang="la">populus</seg>, which elected magistrates and made laws, and also by a senate, which was an administrative body. Subsequently, by a change corresponding to that which took place in Rome, the power of the popular assembly was transferred to the senate, which thus became the supreme municipal body for legislative and administrative purposes.</p>
 <p>The municipal senate is sometimes called <seg lang="la">senatus</seg>, but the terms commonly used to denote it are <seg lang="la">ordo decurionum</seg>, or simply <seg lang="la">ordo</seg>, and in later times <seg lang="la">curia.</seg> Decuriones or curiales signify members of the senate, these words being used indifferently in the same sense.</p>
 <p>As opposed to the decuriones, which formed a sort of patrician body, the rest of the people were styled <seg lang="la">plebeii.</seg> Thè number of the decuriones was fixed by the local senate, and vacancies were filled by co-optation. To be eligible as decurio, a 
<pb n="477" /><cb />
 person was required to be of a certain age; the limit was thirty (Tab. <bibl n="Heracl.  23" default="NO">Heracl.23</bibl>), till reduced by Augustus to twenty-five for the municipal senate as well as for the Roman.</p>
 <p>A property qualification, the amount of which depended on the constitution of each town, was attached to the acquisition of membership in a <seg lang="la">curia</seg>, but membership was not vacated by loss of property. We learn from Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>Ep.</title>i. 19</bibl>) that at Comum a person who had less than 100,000 sesterces could not become a decurio. Criminals, bankrupts, persons of infamous character, and persons who followed certain employments, as <seg lang="la">praecones, designatores, libitinarii</seg>, were incapable of holding this office (Tab. Heracl. 23 (25); cf. <title>Dig.</title> 50, 2, 12). Freedmen were likewise incapable.</p>
 <p>The names of decuriones were inscribed on an album or register in a regular order, which was based partly on rank and partly on seniority. The album of Canusium, which was discovered in the last century and is now in the Museo Nazionale at Naples (Fabretti, <title>Inscr. C.</title> 9, p. 598; Orelli, No. 3721), shows the plan on which such an album was arranged.

 <p> (1) These words were used to signify the manoeuvres of the Roman army, by which the soldiers were taught to make long marches in a given time, under arms and without quitting their ranks. They are frequently mentioned by Livy , and sometimes consisted of a sham fight between two divisions of the army ( Liv. xl. 6<bibl n="Liv.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 5</bibl>). With the standing armies under the Empire these manoeuvres assumed a more regular form, and were constantly practised. Augustus and subsequently Hadrian ordered that the infantry and cavalry were to march out three times a month ten miles from the camp and ten miles back, fully armed and equipped. This is called by Vegetius <seg lang="la">campicursio</seg> (Veget. i. 27, iii. 4), and by Suetonius <seg lang="la">campestris decursio</seg> ( <bibl n="Plut. Galb. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Galb.</title>6</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) The same words were used to signify the military honours paid by soldiers at the funerals <figure id="fig.00477">
<head orig="Decursio on Coin of Nero. (British Museum.)">Decursio on Coin of Nero. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> of distinguished generals or emperors. Such a decursio is first mentioned in connection with the funeral of Sempronius Gracchus, killed in the Second Punic War ( <bibl n="Liv.  25. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxv. 17</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  4" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 4</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 5</bibl>).

 </p>
 <p>(3) The decursio, which occurs on the coins of Nero, probably refers to the military manoeuvres or sham fights in the circus. The above cut represents a horseman with a spear, and another carrying a standard. These games date from the time of the Republic and were continued under the Empire ( Liv. xliv. 9<bibl n="Liv.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 3</bibl>).

 <p>The Lex Aelia Sentia (A.D. 4) provided that, if a slave was put in bonds by his master as a punishment, or branded, or put to the torture on a criminal charge and convicted, or delivered to fight with men or beasts, or committed to a gladiatorial school (<seg lang="la">ludus</seg>) or a public prison, and was subsequently manumitted by the same or by another owner, he should acquire by manumission the status of a <seg lang="la">peregrinus dediticius.</seg> The <seg lang="la">peregrini dediticii</seg> were people who, in former times, having taken up arms and fought against the people of Rome, had surrendered themselves.</p>

<head orig="Defensor Civitātis">Defensor Civitatis</head>

 <p> The oppression of the lower orders of the people by the more powerful, which was prevalent throughout the Roman Empire in the fourth century, owing to the general weakness and corruption of local government, led to the institution of a new municipal officer, called <seg lang="la">defensor civitatis, plebis, loci</seg> (in Greek <foreign lang="greek">ἔκδικος</foreign>), whose function it was to defend the rights of the inhabitants of a <seg lang="la">civitas</seg>, much as the citizens of the Scotch towns were protected in the Middle Ages by the Provost, of which relation Scott has given an interesting picture in his <title>Fair Maid of Perth</title>, i. 8, and ii. 3.</p>
 <p>An edict of the emperor Valentinian I., issued in A.D. 364, established this office, but only for the province of Illyricum. By this edict the governor of the province was directed to choose a trustworthy person for each city of the dioceses subject to him, in order that the <seg lang="la">plebs</seg> of all Illyricum might be protected by means of public guardians (<seg lang="la">patroni</seg>) from injuries at the hands of the powerful (<title>Cod. Theod.</title> i. 29, 1). 
<pb n="478" /><cb /></p>
 <p>In the next year, A.D. 365, Valentinian extended the office of defensor to all parts of his Empire, including Italy, but with some changes in its constitution. Each <seg lang="la">civitas</seg> acquired the right of choosing a defensor from its most eminent and independent citizens, who were bound to serve the office in a prescribed order.</p>
 <p>The election of a defensor was made by the whole <seg lang="la">civitas;</seg> the choice of the township had to be confirmed by the emperor or his deputy. At first a defensor held office for five years, but the term was reduced by Justinian to two years. The protection of the inhabitants of his district from oppression of all kinds, and especially from that of the imperial governor and local authorities, was always considered to be the main object of a defensor civitatis. Moreover it was his business to prevent the taxes being made too burdensome. For the purpose of prosecuting oppressors, he had free access to the court of the governor, and, if necessary, he could bring his complaints against the governor or other officials before the emperor or ministers of the imperial government. The defensor acted as judge in civil cases of minor importance; his jurisdiction was first limited by Justinian to fifty <seg lang="la">solidi</seg>, and afterwards extended by that emperor to three hundred <seg lang="la">solidi.</seg> He had the right of appointing guardians and of registering many formal proceedings. In rank he had precedence of magistrates.

Ann. 3. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 28</bibl>). The Lex Iulia <seg lang="la">de maiestate</seg>, by rewarding the successful prosecutor with a fourth part of the estate of the condemned ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 20</bibl>), gave a fatal encouragement to this class; and although Tiberius appears to have endeavoured at first to check the practice, it became during his reign a veritable scourge; and as his suspicious temper developed, he actually encouraged them. Caligula at the beginning of his reign <seg lang="la">negavit se delatoribus aures habere</seg> ( <title>Calig.</title> 15), and Nero reduced the rewards of those who prosecuted offenders against the Papian law to the legal fourth part. Titus severely punished them; Domitian at first followed his example, but soon proved ready to use them as the tools of his tyrannous greed. They were again banished by Trajan ( <title>Paneg.</title> 34), and denounced by a rescript of Constantine (<title>Cod.</title> x. 11, 5). But the need of this constant repression proves what a standing evil this class must have been to the State.

<head orig="Delia">Delia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Δήλια</foreign>). The name of festivals and games celebrated at the great assemblage in the island 
<pb n="479" /><cb /> of <ref type="cross" target="crossdelos">Delos</ref> (q.v.), the centre of an amphictyony, to which the Cyclades and the neighbouring Ionians on the coasts belonged ( <title>Hymn. in Apoll.</title> 147, etc.) This amphictyony seems originally to have been instituted simply for the purpose of religious worship in the common sanctuary of Apollo, the <foreign lang="greek">θεὸς πατρῷος</foreign> of the Ionians, who was believed to have been born at Delos. The Delia, as appears from the Hymn to Apollo, had existed from very early times, and were celebrated every fifth year (Pollux, viii. 104), and as Boeckh supposes, with great probability, on the sixth and seventh days of Thargelion, the birthdays of Apollo and Artemis. The members of the amphictyony assembled on these occasions (<foreign lang="greek">ἐθεώρουν</foreign>) in Delos, in long garments, with their wives and children, to worship the god with gymnastic and musical contests, choruses, and dances. That the Athenians took part in these solemnities at a very early period is evident from the Deliastae (afterwards called <foreign lang="greek">θεωροί</foreign>) mentioned in the laws of Solon (Athen. vi. p. 234). The sacred vessel (<foreign lang="greek">θεωρίς</foreign>), moreover, which they sent to Delos every year, was said to be the same which Theseus had sent after his return from Crete. The Delians, during the celebration of these solemnities, performed the office of cooks for those who visited their island, whence they were called <foreign lang="greek">Ἐλεοδύται</foreign> (Athen. iv. p. 173).

<head orig="Dēlos">Delos</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δῆλος</foreign>). An island of the Aegean, situated nearly in the centre of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscyclades">Cyclades</ref> (q.v.). This island was called also Asteria, Pelasgia, Chlamydia, Lagia, Pyrpilis, Scythias, Mydia, and Ortygia. It was named Ortygia from <foreign lang="greek">ὄρτυξ</foreign>, “a quail,” and Lagia from <foreign lang="greek">λαγώς</foreign>, “a hare,” the island formerly abounding with both these creatures. On this account, according to Strabo, it was not allowed to have dogs at Delos, because they destroyed the quails and hares. The name Delos was commonly derived from <foreign lang="greek">δῆλος</foreign>, “manifest,” in allusion to the island having floated under the surface of the sea until made to appear and stand firm by order of Poseidon. This was done for the purpose of receiving Leto, who was on the eve of delivery, and could find no asylum on the earth, Heré having bound it by an oath not to receive her; but as Delos at the time was floating beneath the waters, it was freed from the obligation. Once fixed in its place, it continued, according to popular belief, to remain so firm as even to be unmoved <cb /> by the shocks of an earthquake. This, however, is contradicted by Thucydides and Herodotus, who report that a shock was felt there before the Peloponnesian War ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 98" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 98</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Delos was celebrated as the natal island of Apollo and Artemis, and the solemnities with which the festivals of these deities were observed there never failed to attract large crowds from the neighbouring islands and the continent. Among the seven wonders of the world was an altar at Delos which was made of the horns of animals. Tradition reported that it was constructed by Apollo with the horns of deer killed in hunting by his sister Artemis. Plutarch says he saw it, and he speaks of the wonderful interlacing of the horns of which it was made, no cement nor bond of any kind being employed to hold it together. Portions of this altar are identified by archaeologists in the scattered blocks of marble lately found in the so-called Hall of the Bulls, to the east of the great temple, and named from its “taurine” capitals representing recumbent bulls. The Athenians were commanded by an oracle, in the time of Pisistratus, to purify Delos, which they did by causing the dead bodies which had been buried there to be taken up and removed from all places within view of the temple. In the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War, they, by the advice of an oracle, purified it anew by carrying all the dead bodies to the neighbouring island of Rhenaea, where they were interred. After having done this, in order to prevent its being polluted in the time to come, they published an edict that for the future no person should be suffered to die, nor any woman to be brought to bed, in the island, but that, when death or parturition approached, they should be carried over into Rhenaea. In memory of this purification, it is said, the Athenians instituted a solemn quinquennial festival. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdelia">Delia</ref>.</p>
 <p>When the Persian armament, under Datis and Artaphernes, was making its way through the Grecian islands, the inhabitants of Delos left their rich temple, with its treasures, to the protection of its tutelary deities, and fled to Tenos. The fame of the sanctuary, however, saved it from spoliation. The Persians had heard that Delos was the birthplace of two deities who corresponded to those who held the foremost rank in their own religious <figure id="fig.00479">

</figure> 
<pb n="480" /><cb /> system—the sun and moon. This comparison was probably suggested to them by some Greek who wished to save the temple. If we may credit the tradition which was current in the days of Herodotus, Delos received the highest honours from Datis. He would not suffer his ships to touch the sacred shore, but kept them at the island of Rhenaea. He also sent a herald to recall the Delians who had fled to Tenos, and offered sacrifice to the god, in which 300 talents of frankincense are said to have been consumed ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 97" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 97</bibl>). <figure id="fig.00480">
<head orig="Coin of Delos.">Coin of Delos.</head>
</figure> After the Persian War, the Athenians established at Delos the treasury of the Greeks, and ordered that all meetings relative to the confederacy should be held there ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 96" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 96</bibl>). In the tenth year of the Peloponnesian War, not being satisfied with the purifications which the island had hitherto undergone, they removed its entire population to Adramyttium, where they obtained a settlement from the Persian satrap Pharnaces ( <bibl n="Thuc.  5. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.v. 1</bibl>). Here many of these unfortunate Delians were afterwards treacherously murdered by order of Arsaces, an officer of Tissaphernes ( <bibl n="Thuc.  8. 108" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.viii. 108</bibl>). Finally, however, the Athenians restored those that survived to their country after the battle of Amphipolis, as they considered that their ill success in the war proceeded from the anger of the god on account of their conduct towards this unfortunate people ( <bibl n="Thuc.  5. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.v. 32</bibl>). Strabo says that Delos became a place of great commercial importance after the destruction of Corinth, as the merchants who had frequented that city then withdrew to this island, which afforded great facilities for carrying on trade on account of the convenience of its port, and its advantageous situation with respect to the coasts of Greece and Asia Minor, as well as from the great concourse of people who resorted thither at stated times. It was also very famous for its bronze. The Romans especially favoured the interests of the Delians, though they had conceded to the Athenians the sovereignty of the island and the administration of the temple (Polyb. xxx. 18). But on the occupation of Athens by the generals of Mithridates, they landed troops in Delos and committed the greatest devastations there in consequence of the inhabitants refusing to espouse their cause (B.C. 87). After this calamity it remained in an impoverished and deserted state. The town of Delos was situated at the foot of Mount Cynthus, in a plain watered by the little river Inopus, and by a lake called Trochoeides by Theognis and Herodotus. Remains of the great temple of Apollo, of the temple of Leto, a theatre, a private house, and of several porticoes are among the antiquities that are now visible. Since 1877, M. Homolle and others, on behalf of the French Archaeological Institute, have prosecuted very extensive investigations on the site of the town. See Sallier, <title>Hist. de l'Isle de Délos</title>, in the <title>Mém. de l'Académie des Inscriptions</title> iii. 376; and Homolle, <bibl default="NO"><title>Fouilles de Délos</title> (Paris, 1878)</bibl>.

<head orig="Delphi">Delphi</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δελφοί</foreign>). A small but important city of Phocis in Greece, situated on the southern side of Mount Parnassus and built in the form of an amphitheatre. Justin (xxiv. 6) says that it had no walls, but was defended by its precipices. Pausanias (x. 5) calls it <foreign lang="greek">πόλις</foreign>, which seems to imply that it was walled like other cities. In earlier times it was, perhaps, like Olympia, defended by the sanctity of its oracle and the presence of its god. These being found insufficient to afford protection against the enterprises of the profane, it was probably fortified and became a regular city after the predatory incursions of the Phocians. The walls may, however, be coeval with the foundation of the city itself; their high antiquity is not disproved by the use of mortar in the construction, for some of the Egyptian pyramids are built in a similar manner.</p>
 <p>The more ancient name of Delphi was Pytho, from the serpent Python , as is commonly supposed, which was said to have been slain by Apollo ( <title>Biblioth.</title> i. 4, 3). Whence the name Delphi itself was derived we are not informed. Some make the city to have received this name from Delphus, a son of Apollo. Others deduce the appellation from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ἀδελφοί</foreign>, “brethren,” because Apollo and his brother Bacchus were both worshipped there, each having one of the summits of Parnassus sacred to him. The author of the Hymn to Apollo seems to pun on the word Delphi, in making Apollo transform himself into a dolphin (<foreign lang="greek">δελφίς</foreign>—v. 494). Some supposed that the name was intended to designate Delphi as the centre or navel of the earth.</p>
 <p>A short sketch of the history of this most celebrated oracle and temple will not be out of place. Though not so ancient as <ref type="cross" target="crossdodona">Dodona</ref> (q.v.), it is evident that the fame of the Delphic shrine had been established at a very early period, from the mention made of it by Homer and the accounts supplied by Pausanias and Strabo. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo informs us (391 foll.) that, when the Pythian god was establishing his oracle at Delphi, he beheld on the sea a merchant-ship from Crete; this he directed to Crissa, and appointed the foreigners the servants of his newly established sanctuary, near which they settled. When this story is stripped of the language of poetry, it can only mean that a Cretan colony founded the temple and oracle of Delphi. Strabo reports that it was at first consulted only by the neighbouring States; but that after its fame became more widely spread, foreign princes and nations eagerly sought responses from the sacred tripod, and loaded the altar of the god with rich presents and costly offerings (420). Pausanias states that the most ancient temple of Apollo at Delphi was formed, according to some, out of branches of bay, and that these branches were cut from the tree that was at Tempé. The form of this temple resembled that of a cottage. After mentioning a 
<pb n="481" /><cb />
 second and a third temple—the one raised, as the Delphians said, by bees from wax and wings, and sent by Apollo to the Hyperboreans, and the other built of brass—he adds that to this succeeded a fourth and more stately edifice of stone, erected by two architects named Trophonius and Agamedes (Pausan. x. 5). Here were deposited the sumptuous presents of Gyges and Midas, Alyattes and Croesus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 14</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  51" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 51</bibl>), as well as those of the Sybarites, Spinetae, and Siceliots, each prince and nation having their separate chapel or treasury for the reception of these offerings, with an inscription attesting the name of the donor and the cause of the gift. This temple having been accidentally destroyed by fire in B.C. 548, the Amphictyons undertook to build another for the sum of three hundred talents, of which the Delphians were to pay one fourth. The remainder of the amount is said to have been obtained by contributions from the different cities and nations. Amasis, king of Egypt, furnished a thousand talents of <seg lang="la">electrum.</seg> The Alcmaeonidae, a wealthy Athenian family, undertook the contract, and agreed to construct <figure id="fig.00481">
<head orig="View of Delphi and Mount Parnassus.">View of Delphi and Mount Parnassus.</head>
</figure> the edifice of Porine stone, but afterwards liberally substituted Parian marble for the front, a circumstance which is said to have added considerably to their influence at Delphi ( <bibl n="Hdt.  2. 180" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ii. 180</bibl>; v. 62). According to Strabo and Pausanias, the architect was Spintharus, a Corinthian. The vast riches accumulated in this temple led Xerxes, after having forced the pass of Thermopylae, to send a portion of his army into Phocis, with a view of securing Delphi and its treasures, which, as Herodotus affirms, were better known to him than the contents of his own palace. The enterprise, however, failed, owing, as it was reported by the Delphians, to the manifest interposition of the deity, who terrified the barbarians and hurled destruction on their scattered bands ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 37</bibl>). Many years subsequent to this event, the temple fell into the hands of the Phocians, headed by Philomelus, who did not scruple to appropriate its riches to the payment of his troops in the war he was then waging against Thebes. The Phocians are said to have plundered the temple during this contest of gold and silver to the enormous amount of 10,000 talents, <cb /> or about $11,000,000 (cf. Pausan. x. 2). At a still later period, Delphi became exposed to a formidable attack from a large body of Gauls, headed by their king, Brennus. These barbarians, having forced the defiles of Mount Oeta, possessed themselves of the temple and ransacked its treasures. The booty which they obtained on this occasion is stated to have been immense; and this they must have succeeded in removing to their own country, since we are told that, on the capture of Tolosa, a city of Gaul, by the Roman general Caepio, a great part of the Delphic spoils was found there. Pausanias, however, relates that the Gauls met with great disasters in their attempt on Delphi, and were totally discomfited through the miraculous intervention of the god (x. 23; cf. Polyb. i. 6, 5; ii. 20, 6). Sulla is also said to have robbed this temple as well as those of Olympia and Epidaurus. Strabo assures us that in his time the temple was greatly impoverished, all the offerings of any value having been successively removed. The emperor Nero carried off, according to Pausanias (x. 7), five hundred statues of bronze at one time. Constantine the Great, however, proved a more fatal enemy to Delphi than either Sulla or Nero. He removed the sacred tripods to adorn the Hippodrome of his new city, where, together with the Apollo, the statues of the Heliconian Muses, and a celebrated statue of Pan, they were extant when Sozomen wrote his history (Gibbon, <title>Decline and Fall</title>, ch. xvii.). Among these tripods was the famous one which the Greeks, after the battle of Plataea, found in the camp of Mardonius. The Brazen Column which supported this tripod is still to be seen at Constantinople. See the illustration on p. 386.</p>
 <p>The spot whence issued the prophetic vapour which inspired the priestess was said to be the central point (<foreign lang="greek">ὀμφαλός</foreign>) of the earth, this having been proved by Zeus himself, who despatched two eagles from opposite quarters of the heavens, which there encountered each other (Pausan. x. 16). The Omphalos was marked by a stone in the shape of half an egg. Strabo reports that the golden tripod was placed over the mouth of the cave, whence proceeded the exhalation, and which was of great depth. On this sat the Pythia, who, having caught the inspiration, pronounced her oracles in extempore prose or verse; if the former, it was immediately versified by the poet always employed for that purpose. The oracle itself is said to have been discovered by accident. Some goats having strayed to the mouth of the cavern, were suddenly seized with convulsions; those likewise by whom they were found in this situation having been affected in a similar manner, the circumstance was deemed supernatural and the cave pronounced the seat of prophecy (Pausan. x. 5; <title>De Orac. Def.</title> p. 433). Earthquakes have long since obliterated the chasm. The priestess could only be consulted on certain days. The season of inquiry was the spring, during the month Busius ( <title>Quaest. Graec.</title>). Sacrifices and other ceremonies were to be performed by those who sought an answer from the oracle before they could be admitted into the sanctuary.

 <p>The most remarkable of the Pythian responses are those which Herodotus records as having been delivered to the Athenians before the invasion of Xerxes (vii. 140); to Croesus (i. 47); to Lycurgus (i. 65); to Glaucus the Spartan (vi. 86). One relative to Agesilaüs is cited by Pausanias (iii. 8). There was, however, as it appears, no difficulty in bribing and otherwise influencing the Pythia herself, as history presents us with several instances of this imposture. Thus we are told that the Alcmaeonidae suggested on one occasion such answers as accorded with their political designs ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 62</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  90" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 90</bibl>). Cleomenes, king of Sparta, also prevailed on the priestess to aver that his colleague Demaratus was illegitimate. On the discovery, however, of this machination, the Pythia was removed from her office ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 66" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 66</bibl>). Delphi derived further celebrity from its being the place where the Amphictyonic Council held one of their assemblies, and also from the institution of the games which that body established after the successful termination of the Crissaean War. See <ref type="cross" target="crossamphictyones">Amphictyones</ref>.</p>
 <p>The site of Delphi is occupied by the modern hamlet of Kastri. There still exist at Delphi a part of the wall of the great temple of Apollo with columns and steps, a fragment of a curious marble sphinx, the “Column of the Naxians” with an inscription, a small part of the theatre, a carefully constructed tomb, remains of the Stoa of the Athenians, and some other remnants of the ancient buildings.

The name of the god, as well as that of his festival, must be derived from the belief of the ancients that in the beginning of the month of Munychion (probably identical with the Aeginetan Delphinius) Apollo came through the defile of Parnassus to Delphi and began the battle with Delphyné. As he thus assumed the character of a wrathful god, it was thought necessary to appease him, and the Delphinia accordingly were celebrated at Athens, as well as at other places where his worship had been adopted, on the sixth of Munychion. At Athens seven boys and seven girls carried olive-branches, bound with white wool (called the <foreign lang="greek">ἱκετηρία</foreign>), into the Delphinium ( <bibl n="Plut.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημάδης</foreign>). An Athenian orator, who belonged to the Macedonian party, and was a bitter enemy of Demosthenes. He was put to death by Antipater in B.C. 318. Demades was a man without principle, but a vigorous and brilliant orator, always speaking extemporaneously, and with such freshness and force as to rival Demosthenes himself. A long fragment of an oration (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Δωδεκαετίας</foreign>) bears the name of Demades, but is probably spurious.

<head orig="Demarātus">Demaratus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημάρατος</foreign>). (1) The son and successor of Ariston on the throne of Sparta, B.C. 516. He was deposed, through the intrigues of Cleomenes, his colleague, on the ground of his being illegitimate. After his deposition he was chosen and held the office of magistrate; but being insultingly derided on one occasion by Leotychides, who had been appointed king in his stead, he crossed over into Asia to Darius, who received him honourably and presented him with lands and cities ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 65" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 65</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  70" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 70</bibl>). He enabled Xerxes subsequently to obtain the nomination to the empire, in preference to his elder brother Artabazarnes, by suggesting to him an argument, the justice of which was acknowledged by Darius ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 3</bibl>). <cb /> We find him after this, though an exile from his country, yet sending the first intelligence to Sparta of the designs of Xerxes against Greece. He accompanied that monarch on his expedition, frankly praised the discipline of the Greeks, and especially that of the Spartans; and before the battle of Thermopylae explained to him some of the warlike customs of the last-mentioned people. We learn also that he advised Xerxes to seize, with his fleet, the island of Cythera, off the coast of Laconia, from which he might continually ravage the shores of that country. The monarch did not adopt his suggestion, but still always regarded the exile Spartan as a friend, and treated him accordingly.</p>
 <p>(2) A rich citizen of Corinth, of the family of the Bacchiadae. When Cypselus had usurped the sovereign power of Corinth, Demaratus, with all his family, migrated to Italy, and settled at Tarquinii, 658 years before Christ. Commerce had not been deemed disreputable among the Corinthian nobility; and as a merchant, therefore, Demaratus had formed ties of friendship at this place. He brought great wealth with him. The sculptors Eucheir and Eugrammus, and Cleophantus the painter, were said to have accompanied him, and along with the fine arts of Greece he taught (so the popular account said) alphabetic writing to the Etrurians. His son called Lucumo went afterwards to Rome, and became king there under the name of Tarquinius Priscus ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 34</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>(3) A Corinthian, in the time of Philip and his son Alexander. He had connections of hospitality with the royal family of Macedon, and, having paid a visit to Philip, succeeded in reconciling that monarch to his son. After Alexander had overthrown the Persian Empire, Demaratus, though advanced in years, made a voyage to the east in order to see the conqueror, and, when he beheld him, exclaimed, “What a pleasure have those Greeks missed, who died without seeing Alexander seated on the throne of Darius!” He died soon after, and was honoured with a magnificent funeral ( <bibl n="Plut.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημήτηρ</foreign>). The daughter of Cronus and Rhea. Her name signifies Mother Earth, meaning that she was goddess of agriculture and of the civilization based upon it. Her children were: by Iasion, a son Plutus, the god of riches,

 and by her brother Zeus, a daughter Persephoné. Round Demeter and this daughter centre her worship and the fables respecting her. Hades carried off Persephoné, and Demeter roamed for nine days over the earth seeking her, till on the tenth day she learned the truth from the all-seeing Sun. She was angry with Zeus for permitting the act of violence; visited Olympus, and wandered about among men in the form of an old woman under the name of Deo, or the Seeker, till at length, at Eleusis, in Attica, she was kindly received at the house of King Celeus, and found comfort in tending his newly born son Demophoön. Surprised by his mother in the act of trying to make the <figure id="fig.00484">

</figure> child immortal by putting it into the fire, she revealed her deity, and caused a temple to be built to her, in which she gave herself up to her grief. In her wrath she made the earth barren, so that mankind were threatened with destruction by famine, as she did not allow the fruit of the earth to spring up again until her daughter was allowed to spend two thirds of the year with her. On her return to Olympus she left the gift of corn, of agriculture, and of her holy mysteries with her host, as a token of grateful recollection. She sent Triptolemus the Eleusinian round the world on her chariot, drawn by serpents, to diffuse the <cb /> knowledge of agriculture and other blessings accompanying it—the settlement of fixed places of abode, civil order, and wedlock. Thus Demeter was worshipped as the goddess of agriculture and founder of law, order, and especially of marriage, in all places where Greeks dwelt, her daughter being usually associated with her. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossthesmophoria">Thesmophoria</ref>.) The most ancient seats of her worship were Athens and Eleusis, where the Rharian plain was solemnly ploughed every year in memory of the first sowing of wheat. She was also much worshipped in Sicily, which from its fertility was accounted one of her favourite places of abode. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosseleusinia">Eleusinia</ref>.) As the goddess of fertility, Demeter was in many regions associated with Poseidon, the god of fertilizing water. This was particularly the case in Arcadia, where Poseidon was regarded as the father of Persephoné. She was also joined with Dionysus, the god of wine; and as mother of Persephoné and goddess of the earth, to which not only the seed, but the dead are committed, she is connected with the lower world under the name of Chthonia. In later times she was often confused with Gaea and Rhea or Cybelé. Besides fruit and honeycombs, the cow and the sow were offered to her, both as emblems of productivity. Her attributes are poppies and ears of corn (also a symbol of fruitfulness), a basket of fruit, and a little pig. Other emblems had a mystic significance—e. g. the torch, and the serpent, as living in the earth, and as symbolizing a renewal of life by shedding its skin. The Romans identified her with their own <ref type="cross" target="crossceres">Ceres</ref> (q.v.).

<div2 id="crossdemetria" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Demetria">Demetria</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημητρία</foreign>). An annual festival which the Athenians, in B.C. 307, instituted in honour of Demetrius Poliorcetes, who, together with his father Antigonus, was consecrated under the title of “saviour god.” It was celebrated every year in the month of Munychion, the name of which, as well as that of the day on which the festival was held, was changed into Demetrion and Demetrias. A priest ministered at their altars, and conducted the solemn procession and the sacrifices and games with which the festival was celebrated ( <bibl n="Diod.  20. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.

<div2 id="crossdemetrius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Demetrius">Demetrius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημήτριος</foreign>). (1) A son of Antigonus 
<pb n="485" /><cb />
 and Stratonicé, surnamed Poliorcetes (<foreign lang="greek">Πολιορκητής</foreign>), “besieger of cities,” from his talents as an engineer and his peculiar skill in conducting sieges, especially by the aid of machines and engines either invented or improved by himself. At the age of twenty-two he was sent by his father against Ptolemy (B.C. 312), who had invaded Syria. He was defeated near Gaza, but soon repaired his loss by a victory over one of the generals of the enemy. He afterwards sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens, and restored the Athenians to liberty, by freeing them from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy and expelling the garrison which was stationed there under Demetrius Phalereus. The gratitude of the Athenians to their deliverer passed all bounds, but Demetrius was soon summoned by his father to leave the flattery of their orators in order to resume the combined duties of an admiral and an engineer in the reduction of Cyprus. After a slight engagement with Menelaüs, the brother of Ptolemy, he laid siege to Salamis, the ancient capital of that island. The occurrences of this siege occupy a prominent place in history, not so much on account of the determined resistance opposed to the assailants and the great importance attached to its issue by the heads of the belligerent parties, as for a new species of warlike engine invented by Demetrius, and first employed by him against the city of Salamis. The instrument in question was called an <foreign lang="greek">ἑλέπολις</foreign>, or “town-taker,” and was an immense tower, consisting of nine stories, gradually diminishing as they rose in altitude, and affording accommodation for a large number of armed men, who thence discharged all sorts of missiles against the ramparts of the enemy. Ptolemy, dreading the fall of Salamis, which would pave the way, as he easily foresaw, for the entire conquest of Cyprus, had already made formidable preparations for compelling Demetrius to raise the siege. A memorable sea-fight ensued, in which the ruler of Egypt was completely defeated, with the loss of nearly all his fleet and 30,000 prisoners. An invasion of Egypt by Antigonus then took place, but ended disgracefully; and Demetrius was sent to reduce the Rhodians, who persisted in remaining allies of Ptolemy. The operations of Demetrius before Rhodes, and the resolute defence of the place by the inhabitants, present perhaps the most remarkable example of skill and heroism that is to be found in the annals of ancient warfare. The <foreign lang="greek">ἑλέπολις</foreign> employed on this occasion greatly exceeded the one that was used in the siege of Salamis. Its towers were 150 feet high; it was supported on eight enormous wheels, and propelled by the labour of 3400 men. After a siege of a whole year, however, the enterprise was abandoned, a treaty was concluded with the Rhodians, and Demetrius, at the request of the Athenians, who were now again subjected to the Macedonians, proceeded to rescue Greece from the power of Cassander. In this he was so successful that he ultimately spread the terror of his arms over the whole of that country. The object of Antigonus and his son was now to effect the final subjugation of Macedonia, Egypt, and the East. The confederacy of Seleucus, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander was therefore renewed, with the view of crushing these ambitious schemes, and in the battle of Ipsus they succeeded in effecting their object. Antigonus fell in the conflict, and Demetrius, after a precipitate flight of 200 miles, regained his fleet with <cb /> only a small remnant of his once powerful host. Sailing soon after to Athens, he received information from the fickle inhabitants that they had resolved to admit no king within their city; upon which, finding that all Greece had now submitted to the influence of Cassander, he made a descent on the coast at Corinth for the mere purpose of plunder and revenge, and afterwards committed similar ravages along the whole coast of Thrace. Fortune, however, soon smiled again. Seleucus, jealous of the power of Lysimachus, whose territories now extended to the Syrian borders, resolved to strengthen his own dominions by forming an alliance with the family of Demetrius, which was still possessed of considerable claims and interests. He therefore made proposals for, and obtained in marriage, Stratonicé, the daughter of his former rival. The power of Demetrius again became formidable, an alliance with Ptolemy, who gave him his daughter Ptolemaïs in marriage, having also added to its increase. He compelled the Athenians to open their gates and receive a garrison; and having generously forgiven their previous fickleness, he turned his attention to Macedonia, and embracing an opportunity of interfering in the affairs of that country, which was afforded by dissensions between the two sons of Cassander, he cut off Alexander, one of the two princes, and made himself master of the throne. His restless ambition now projected new conquests in Europe and Asia. Turning his arms against Pyrrhus, he drove him from Thessaly, and then marched to Thebes, which he took by assault. About the same time also he built the city of Demetrias on the Pagasaean Gulf; and, in order to increase his naval power, formed a matrimonial union with the daughter of Agathocles, tyrant of Sicily. His fleet at length amounted to 500 galleys; while his land forces exceeded considerably 100,000 men, of which more than 12,000 were cavalry. This formidable power <figure id="fig.00485">
<head orig="Coin of Demetrius Poliorcetes.">Coin of Demetrius Poliorcetes.</head>
</figure> excited the alarm of Lysimachus and Ptolemy; the latter advanced against Greece with his fleet, while the former, with Pyrrhus his ally, made a land attack on Macedon in two different points at once. Demetrius took the field with his usual alacrity, but when he approached the position of Pyrrhus the greater part of his troops deserted him and he was compelled to flee. Leaving Macedon a prey to Lysimachus and Pyrrhus, Demetrius passed over into Asia Minor with a body of his best troops, resolved to assail his adversary in the most vulnerable quarter. The enterprise was at first attended with the most brilliant success. In a short time, however, a check was imposed on his career by Agathocles, the son of Lysimachus, and Demetrius was compelled to apply for protection to his aged son-in-law Seleucus. The latter yielded to his solicitations only so far as to grant him permission to spend two months within his territory; and was subsequently induced by his courtiers to rid himself 
<pb n="486" /><cb /> of so dangerous a guest, by sending him a prisoner to a strong fortress on the Syrian coast, about sixty miles south of A sufficient revenue was allowed him for his support, and he was permitted to indulge in the chase and other exercises, always, however, under the eye of his keepers. At last, giving up all active pursuits, he died (B.C. 283) at the end of three years. The age of Demetrius at the time of his death was fifty-four. His posterity enjoyed the throne of Macedon in continued succession down to Perses, when the Roman conquest took place. See the life of Demetrius by Plutarch.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of Antigonus Gonatas, and grandson of Demetrius Poliorcetes, succeeded his father, B.C. 239. He made war on the Aetolians and the Achaeans, and was successful against both, especially the latter, whom he defeated, although under the command of Aratus. He had distinguished himself, before coming to the throne, by driving Alexander of Epirus out of Macedonia, and by stripping him of his own dominions. He reigned ten years, and was succeeded by Antigonus Doson.</p>
 <p>(3) Son of Philip III., of Macedonia, an excellent prince, greatly beloved by his countrymen, and sent by his father as a hostage to Rome, where he also made many friends. He was subsequently liberated, and not long after paid a second visit to the capital of Italy as an ambassador from Philip, on which occasion he obtained favourable terms for his father, when the latter was complained of to the Roman Senate by the cities of Greece. Returning home loaded with marks of distinction from the Romans, and honoured by the Macedonians themselves, who regarded him as the liberator of their country, he excited the jealousy of his own father and the envy and hatred of his brother Perses. The latter eventually accused him of aspiring to the crown, and of carrying on, for this purpose, a secret correspondence with the Romans. Philip, lending too credulous an ear to the charge, put his son Demetrius to death, and only discovered when too late the utter falsity of the accusation ( <bibl n="Liv.  33. 30" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxiii. 30</bibl>; xxxix. 35 foll.; xl. 5<bibl n="Liv.  24" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 24</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  54" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 54</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>(4) A Syrian, called <ref type="cross" target="crosssoter">Soter</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Σωτήρ</foreign>), or “the Preserver,” the son of Seleucus Philopator, and sent by his father, at the age of twenty-three, as a hostage to Rome. He was living there in this condition when his father died of poison, B.C. 176. His uncle Antiochus Epiphanes thereupon usurped the throne, and was succeeded by Antiochus Eupator. Demetrius, meanwhile, having in vain endeavoured to interest the Senate in his behalf, secretly escaped from Rome, through the advice of Polybius the historian, and, finding a party in Syria ready to support his claims, defeated and put to death Eupator, and ascended the throne. He was subsequently acknowledged as king by the Romans. After this, he freed the Babylonians from the tyranny of Timarchus and Heraclides, and was honoured for this service with the title of Soter. At a subsequent period he sent his generals Nicanor and Bacchides into Iudaea, at the solicitation of Alcimus, the high-priest, who had usurped that office with the aid of Eupator. These two commanders ravaged the country, and Bacchides defeated and slew the celebrated Judas Maccabaeus. Demetrius at last became so hated by his own subjects, and an object of so much dislike, if not of fear, to the neighbouring princes, that they advocated the claims of Alexander Balas, and he fell in battle against this competitor for the crown after <cb /> having reigned twelve years (from B.C. 162 to B.C. 150). His death was avenged, however, by his son and successor Demetrius Nicator ( <bibl n="Just.  34. 3" default="NO">Just.xxxiv. 3</bibl><bibl n="Just.  35. 1" default="NO">Just., xxxv. 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(5) Son of the preceding, and surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossnicator">Nicator</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Νικάτωρ</foreign>), or “the Conqueror.” He drove out Alexander Balas, with the aid of Ptolemy Philometor, who had given him his daughter Cleopatra in marriage, though she was already the wife of Balas. He ascended the throne B.C. 146, but soon abandoned himself to a life of indolence and debauchery, leaving the reins of government in the hands of Lasthenes, his favourite, an unprincipled and violent man. The disgust to which his conduct gave rise induced Tryphon, who had been governor of Antioch under Balas, to revolt, and place upon the throne Antiochus Dionysius, son of Balas and Cleopatra , a child only four years of age. A battle ensued, in which Demetrius was defeated, and Antiochus, now receiving the surname of Theos, was conducted by the victors to Antioch and proclaimed king of Syria. He reigned, however, only in name. The actual monarch was Tryphon, who put him to death at the end of about two years and caused himself to be proclaimed in his stead. Demetrius, meanwhile, held his court at Seleucia. Thinking that the crimes of Tryphon would soon make him universally detested, he turned his arms in a different direction and marched against the Parthians, in the hope that, if he returned victorious, he would be enabled the more easily to rid himself of his Syrian antagonist. After some successes, however, he was entrapped and made prisoner by the Parthian monarch Mithridates, and his army was attacked and cut to pieces. His captivity among the Parthians was an honourable one, and Mithridates made him espouse his daughter Rhodoguna. The intelligence of this marriage so exasperated Cleopatra that she gave her hand to Antiochus Sidetes, her brotherin-law, who thereupon ascended the throne. Sidetes having been slain in a battle with the Parthians after a reign of several years, Demetrius escaped from the hands of Mithridates and resumed the throne. His subjects, however, unable any longer to endure his pride and cruelty, requested from Ptolemy Physcon a king of the race of the Seleucidae to govern them. Ptolemy sent Alexander Zubinas. Demetrius, driven out by the Syrians, came to Ptolemaïs, where Cleopatra , his first wife, then held sway, but the gates were shut against him. He then took refuge in Tyre, but was put to death by the governor (B.C. 125). Zubinas recompensed the Tyrians for this act by permitting them to live according to their own laws, and from this period commences what is called by chronologists the era of the independence of Tyre, which was still subsisting at the time of the Council of Chalcedon, 574 years after this event (Joseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xiii. 9, 12, 17; <bibl n="Just.  36. 1" default="NO">Just.xxxvi. 1</bibl><bibl n="Just.  39. 1" default="NO">Just., xxxix. 1</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(6) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Eukaerus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὔκαιρος</foreign>), “the Seasonable” or “Fortunate,” was the fourth son of Antiochus Grypus. He was proclaimed king at Damascus, and, in conjunction with his brother Philip, to whom a part of Syria remained faithful, drove out Antiochus Eusebes from that country, compelling him to take refuge among the Parthians. The two brothers then divided Syria between them, Antioch being the capital of Philip and Damascus that of Demetrius. The latter afterwards marched to the aid of the Jews, who had revolted from their king, Alexander Ianneus. He was recalled, however, to his own 
<pb n="487" /><cb />
 dominions by the news of an invasion on the part of his own brother Philip. He took Antioch, and besieged Philip in Beroea; but the latter being assisted by the Parthians and the Arabians, Demetrius was besieged in his own camp and at length taken prisoner. He was brought to the king of Parthia, who treated him with great distinction and sent him into Upper Asia. He reigned a little over six years.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pepagomĕnus</hi>, a medical writer, who flourished during the reign of Michael VIII. (Palaeologus). By the order of this monarch, he wrote a work on the gout (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ποδάγρας</foreign>). We have two treatises under his name, but it is extremely doubtful whether he was indeed their author. The first is on the art of training falcons; the second, on the mode of breaking and training dogs.</p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phalēreus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Φαληρεύς</foreign>), a native of Phalerum in Attica, and the last of the more distinguished orators of Greece. He was the son of a person who had been slave to Timotheus and Conon. But, though born in this low condition, he soon made himself distinguished by his talents, and was already a conspicuous individual in the public assemblies when Antipater became master of Athens, for he was obliged to save himself by flight from the vengeance of the Macedonian party. He was compelled to quit the city a second time when Polysperchon took possession of it through his son. Subsequently named by Cassander as governor of Athens (B.C. 317), he so gained the affections of his countrymen that, during the six years in which he filled this office, they are said to have raised to him three hundred and sixty statues. Athenaeus, however, on the authority of Duris , a Samian writer, reproaches him with luxurious and expensive habits, while he prescribed, at the same time, frugality to his fellowcitizens and fixed limits for their expenditures. After the death of his protector, Demetrius was driven from Athens by Antigonus and Demetrius Poliorcetes (B.C. 306). The people of that city, always fickle, overthrew the numerous statues they had erected to him, although he had been their benefactor and idol, and even condemned him to death. Demetrius, upon this, retired to the court of Alexandria, where he lived upwards of twenty years. It is generally supposed that he was the individual who gave Ptolemy the advice to found the Museum and the famous Library. This prince consulted him also as to the choice of a successor. Demetrius was in favour of the monarch's eldest son, but the king eventually decided for the son whom he had by his second wife Berenicé. When Ptolemy II., therefore, came to the throne, he revenged himself on the unlucky counsellor by exiling him to a distant province in Upper Egypt, where Demetrius put an end to his own life by the bite of an asp (B.C. 282). Cicero describes Demetrius as a polished, sweet, and graceful speaker, but deficient in energy and power. Plutarch cites his treatise “On Socrates,” which appears to have contained also a life of Aristides. The works of Demetrius are lost. There exists, it is true, under his name a treatise on elocution (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας</foreign>), a work full of ingenious observations; but critics agree in making it of later origin. Besides the treatise on elocution, there exists a small work on the apophthegms of the Seven Sages, which Stobaeus has inserted in his third discourse, as being the production of Demetrius Phalereus.</p>
 <p>(9) Of Sunium; a Cynic philosopher, who flourished at <cb /> Corinth in the first century. During the reign of Caligula he taught philosophy at Rome, where he obtained the highest reputation for wisdom and virtue. He was banished from Rome in the time of Nero for his free censure of public manners. After the death of this emperor he returned to Rome, but the boldness of his language soon offended Vespasian and again subjected him to the punishment of exile. Apollonius, with whom he had formed a friendship, prevailed on Titus to recall him; but under Domitian he withdrew to Puteoli. Seneca, who was acquainted with him, speaks in the highest terms of his masculine eloquence, sound judgment, intrepid fortitude, and inflexible integrity ( <title>De Vit. Beat.</title> 25).

This would occur if a Roman citizen were taken prisoner in war, or given up to the enemy for having violated the sanctity of an ambassador or concluding a treaty not approved of by the people. Or again if he was sold into slavery, whether by the State for refusing military service, or for declining to state the amount of his property at the census, or by his creditors for debt. If a prisoner of war returned home, or if the enemy refused to accept him when given up to them, his former civil rights were restored. The intermediate stage, <seg lang="la">deminutio capitis media</seg> or <seg lang="la">minor</seg>, consisted in loss of civil rights consequent on becoming a citizen of another State, or on a decree of exile confirmed by the people, or (in imperial times) on deportation. Restoration of the civil status was possible if the foreign citizenship were given up, or if the decree of exile were cancelled. The lowest grade (<seg lang="la">deminutio capitis minima</seg>) was the loss of hitherto existing family rights by emancipation (which involved leaving the family), adoption, or (if a girl) by marriage.

This right was not always absolutely equal. Sometimes classes were formed on a property qualification and civil rights conferred accordingly (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstimocratia">Timocratia</ref>); but no class in this case was absolutely excluded from a share in the government, and it was possible to rise from one class to another. Sometimes provision was made by law to prevent any persons taking part in the administration but such as had proved their worth and capacity.

<div2 id="crossdemocritus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Democrĭtus">Democritus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημόκριτος</foreign>). A celebrated philosopher, born at Abdera, about B.C. 494 or 490, but according to some, B.C. 470 or 460. His father was a man of noble family and of great wealth, and contributed largely towards the entertainment of the army of Xerxes on his return to Asia. As a reward for this service the Persian monarch made him and the other Abderites rich presents and left among them several Chaldaean Magi. Democritus, according to Diogenes Laertius, was instructed by these in astronomy and theology. After the death of his father he determined to travel in search of wisdom, and devoted to this purpose the <cb /> portion which fell to him, amounting to one hundred talents. He is said to have visited Egypt and Ethiopia, the Persian Magi, and, according to some, even the Gymnosophists of India. Whether, in the course of his travels, he visited Athens or studied under Anaxagoras is uncertain. There can be little doubt, however, that during some part of his life he was instructed in the Pythagorean tenets, and particularly that he was a disciple of <ref type="cross" target="crossleucippus">Leucippus</ref> (q.v.). After a long course of years thus spent in travelling, Democritus returned to Abdera, richly stored with the treasures of philosophy, but destitute even of the necessary means of subsistence. His brother Damosis, however, received him kindly and liberally supplied all his wants. According to the law of Abdera, whoever should waste his patrimony should be deprived of the rites of burial. Democritus, desiring to avoid this disgrace, gave public lectures to the people, chiefly from his larger <foreign lang="greek">Διάκοσμος</foreign>, the most valuable of his writings; in return he received from his hearers many valuable presents and otlrer testimonies of respect, which relieved him from all apprehension of suffering public censure as a spendthrift.</p>
 <p>Democritus, by his learning and wisdom, and especially by his acquaintance with natural phenomena, acquired great fame and excited much admiration among the ignorant Abderites. By giving previous notices of unexpected changes in the weather, and by other artifices, he had the address to make them believe that he possessed a power of predicting future events; and they not only looked upon him as something more than mortal, but even proposed to invest him with the direction of their public affairs. From inclination and habit, however, he preferred a contemplative to an active life, and therefore declined these public honours and passed the remainder of his days in solitude. It is said that from this time he spent his days and nights in caverns and sepulchres; and some even relate that, in order to be more perfectly master of his intellectual faculties, he blinded himself by means of a burning-glass. The story, however, is utterly incredible, since the writers who mention it affirm that Democritus employed his leisure in writing books and in dissecting the bodies of animals, neither of which could well have been effected without eyes. Nor is greater credit due to the tale that Democritus spent his leisure hours in chemical researches after the philosopher's stone—the dream of a later age; or to the story of his conversation with Hippocrates, grounded upon letters which are said to have passed between the father of medicine and the people of Abdera on the supposed madness of Democritus, but which are evidently spurious. The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from these and other tales is that Democritus was a man of lofty genius and penetrating judgment, who, by a long course of study and observation, became an eminent master of speculative and physical science; the natural consequence of which was that, like Roger Bacon in a later period, he astonished and imposed upon his ignorant and credulous countrymen. Petronius relates that he was perfectly acquainted with the virtues of herbs, plants, and stones, and that he spent his life in making experiments upon natural bodies.</p>
 <p>Democritus has been commonly known under the appellation of “The Laughing Philosopher,” 
<pb n="489" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00489">
<head orig="Democritus. (Naples Museum.)">Democritus. (Naples Museum.)</head>
</figure>
 and it is gravely related by Seneca (<title>De Ira</title>, ii. 10; <title>De Tranq.</title> 15) that he never appeared in public without expressing his contempt of the follies of mankind by laughter. Thus much, in fact, may be easily believed: that a man so superior to the generality of his contemporaries, and whose lot it was to live among a race of men who were stupid to a proverb, might frequently treat their follies with ridicule and contempt. Accordingly, we find that among his fellow-citizens he had the name of <foreign lang="greek">Γελασῖνος</foreign>, or “the mocker” (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  10. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.x. 33</bibl><bibl n="Juv.  34" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv., 34</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Democritus appears to have been in his morals chaste and temperate, and his sobriety was repaid by a healthy old age. He lived and enjoyed the use of his faculties to the term of a hundred years, and at last died through mere decay.</p>
 <p>Democritus expanded the atomic theory of his master <ref type="cross" target="crossleucippus">Leucippus</ref> (q.v.), to support the truth of which he maintained the impossibility of division <seg lang="la">ad infinitum;</seg> and, from the difficulty of assigning a commencement of time, he argued the eternity of existing nature, of void space, and of motion. He supposed the atoms, originally similar, to be endowed with certain properties, such as impenetrability and a density proportionate to their volume. He referred every active and passive affection to motion, caused by impact, limited by the principle he assumed, that like can only act on like. He drew a distinction between primary motion and secondary; impulse and reaction; from a combination of which he produced rotary motion. Herein consists the law of necessity, by which all things in nature are ruled. From the endless multiplicity of falling atoms have resulted the worlds which we behold, with all the properties of immensity, resemblance, and dissimilitude which belong to them. The soul consists (such is his doctrine) of globular atoms of fire, which impart movement to the body. Maintaining his atomic theory throughout, Democritus introduced the hypothesis of images (<foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλα</foreign>), a species of emanation from external objects, which make an impression on our senses, and from the influence of which he deduced sensation (<foreign lang="greek">αἴσθησις</foreign>) and thought (<foreign lang="greek">νόησις</foreign>). He distinguished between a rude, imperfect, and therefore false perception and a true one. In the same manner, consistently with his theory, he accounted for the popular notions of the Deity; partly <cb /> through our incapacity to understand fully the phenomena of which we are witnesses, and partly from the impressions communicated by certain beings (<foreign lang="greek">εἴδωλα</foreign>) of enormous stature and resembling the human figure which inhabit the air. To these he ascribed dreams and the causes of divination. He carried his theory into practical philosophy also, laying down that happiness consisted in an equability of temperament (<foreign lang="greek">εὐθυμία</foreign>), whence he deduced his moral principles and prudential maxims. It was from Democritus that <ref type="cross" target="crossepicurus">Epicurus</ref> (q.v.) borrowed the principal features of his philosophy. The fragments of Democritus have been collected and published by Mullach <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1843)</bibl>, with notes.

<div2 id="crossdemosthenes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Demosthĕnes">Demosthenes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δημοσθένης</foreign>). (1) A celebrated Athenian orator, a native of the deme of Paeania, in the tribe Pandionis. His father, Demosthenes, was a citizen of rank and opulence, and the proprietor of a manufactory of arms; not a common blacksmith, as the language of Juvenal (x. 130) would lead us to believe. The son was born about B.C. 383, and lost his father at the early age of seven years, when he was left to the care of his mother, Cleobulé. The guardians to whom his father had intrusted the administration of a large property proving faithless to their charge and wasting a large portion of his patrimony, the orator's early studies were seriously hampered by the want of sufficient means, to say nothing of the delicate state of his own health. When Demosthenes was some sixteen years of age his curiosity was attracted by a trial in which Callistratus pleaded and won a cause of considerable importance. The eloquence which gained, and the applause which followed, his success so inflamed the ambition of the young Athenian that he determined to devote himself thenceforward to the assiduous study of oratory. He chose Isaeus as his master rather than Isocrates; from Plato, also, he imbibed much of the richness and the grandeur which characterize the writings of that philosopher. At the age of seventeen he appeared before the courts and pronounced against his faithless guardians, and against a debtor to his father's estate, five orations, which were crowned with complete success. These discourses, in all probability, had received the finishing touch from Isaeus , under whom Demosthenes continued to study for the space of four years after he had reached his majority.</p>
 <p>An opening so successful emboldened the young orator to speak before the people in the assembly; but, when he made the attempt, his feeble and stammering voice, his interrupted respiration, his ungraceful gestures, and his ill-arranged periods, brought upon him general ridicule. Returning home in the utmost distress, he was encouraged by the kindness of the actor Satyrus, who, having requested Demosthenes to repeat some passage from a dramatic poet, pronounced the same extract after him with so much correctness of enunciation and in a manner so true to nature that it appeared to the young orator to be quite a different passage. <cb /> Convinced, thereupon, how much grace and persuasive power a proper enunciation and manner add to the best oration, he resolved to correct the deficiencies of his youth, and accomplished this with a zeal and perseverance which have passed into a proverb. To free himself from stammering he spoke with pebbles in his mouth, a story resting on the authority of Demetrius Phalereus, his contemporary. It also appears that he was unable to articulate clearly the letter R; but he vanquished that difficulty most perfectly, for Cicero says that he <seg lang="la">exercitatione fecisse ut plenissime diceret.</seg> He removed the distortion of features which accompanied his utterance by watching the movements of his countenance in a mirror; and a naked sword was suspended over his left shoulder while he was declaiming in private, to prevent its rising above the level of the right. That his enunciation might be loud and full of emphasis he frequently ran up the steepest and most uneven walks, an exercise by which his voice acquired both force and energy; and on the sea-shore, when the waves were violently agitated, he declaimed aloud, to accustom himself to the noise and tumult of a public assembly. He constructed a subterranean study, where he would often stay for two or three months together, shaving one side of his head, that in case he should wish to go abroad the shame of appearing in that condition might keep him within. In this solitary retreat, by the light of his lamp, he is said to have copied and recopied, ten times at least, the orations scattered throughout the history of Thucydides, for the purpose of moulding his own style after so pure a model.</p>
 <p>Whatever may be the truth of these stories, Demosthenes got credit for the most indefatigable labour in the acquisition of his art. His enemies, at a subsequent period of his career, attempted to ridicule this extraordinary industry, by remarking that all his arguments “smelled of the lamp,” and they eagerly embraced the opportunity of denying him the possession of natural talents. This criticism of Demosthenes seems to have rested chiefly on his known reluctance to speak without preparation. The fact is, that though he could exert the talent of extemporaneous speaking, he avoided rather than sought such occasions, partly from deference to his audience and partly from apprehending the possibility of a failure. Plutarch, however, who mentions this reluctance of the orator, speaks at the same time of the great merit of his extemporaneous effusions.</p>
 <p>Demosthenes reappeared in public at the age of twenty-five years, and pronounced two orations against Leptines, the author of a law which imposed on every citizen of Athens, except the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton, the exercise of certain burdensome functions. The second of these discourses, entitled “Of Immunities,” is regarded as one of his happiest efforts. After this, he became much engaged in the business of the bar, and these professional labours, added to the scanty portion of his patrimony which he had recovered from his guardians, appear to have formed his only means of support. But, whatever may have been the distinction and the advantages which Demosthenes acquired by his practice at the bar, his principal glory is derived from his political discourses. At the period when he engaged in public affairs the State was a mere wreck. Public spirit was at the lowest ebb; the laws had 
<pb n="491" /><cb />
 lost their authority; the austerity of early manners had yielded to the inroads of luxury, activity to indolence, and probity to venality. Of the virtues of their fathers there remained to the Athenians little save an attachment, carried almost to enthusiasm, for their native soil. On the slightest occasion this feeling of patriotism was sure to display itself; and, thanks to this sentiment, the people of Athens were still capable of making strenuous efforts for the preservation of their freedom. No one understood better than Demosthenes the art of exciting <figure id="fig.00491">
<head orig="Demosthenes. (Vatican Museum, Rome.)">Demosthenes. (Vatican Museum, Rome.)</head>
</figure> and keeping alive this enthusiasm. His penetration enabled him easily to divine the ambitious plans of Philip of Macedon from the very outset of that monarch's operations, and he resolved to counteract them. His whole public career, indeed, had but one object in view, and that was war with Philip. For the space of fourteen years this monarch found the Athenian orator continually in his path, and every attempt proved unavailing to corrupt so formidable an adversary. These fourteen years, which immediately preceded the fall of Grecian freedom, constitute the brightest period in <cb /> the history of Demosthenes. And yet his courage was political rather than military. At Chaeronea (B.C. 338) he fled from the field of battle, though in the Athenian assembly no private apprehensions could check his eloquence or influence his conduct. But, though overpowered in the contest with the enemy of Athenian independence, he received after his defeat the most honourable recompense which, in accordance with Grecian customs, a grateful country could bestow. Athens decreed him a crown of gold. The reward was opposed by <ref type="cross" target="crossaeschines">Aeschines</ref> (q.v.). The combat of eloquence which arose between the two orators attracted to Athens an immense concourse of spectators. Demosthenes triumphed, and his antagonist, not having received the fifth part of the votes, was, in conformity with the existing law, compelled to retire into exile. A short time after this splendid victory Demosthenes was condemned for having suffered himself to be bribed by Harpalus, a Macedonian governor, who, dreading the anger of Alexander, had come to Athens to hide there the fruit of his extortion and rapine, and had bargained with the popular leaders of the day for the protection of the Republic. Demosthenes, having escaped from imprisonment, fled to Aegina (B.C. 324), whence he could behold the shores of his beloved country, and earnestly and constantly protested his innocence. After the death of Alexander he was restored, and his entry into Athens was marked by every demonstration of joy. A new league was formed among the Grecian cities against the Macedonians, and Demosthenes was the soul of it. But the confederacy was broken up by Antipater, and the death of the orator was decreed. He retired, thereupon, from Athens to the island of Calauria, off the coast of Argolis, and, being still pursued by the satellites of Antipater, terminated his life there by poison, in the temple of Poseidon, at the age of about sixty years, B.C. 322.</p>
 <p>Before the time of Demosthenes there existed three distinct styles of eloquence: that of Lysias, mild and persuasive, which quietly engaged the attention and won the assent of an audience; that of Thucydides, bold and animated, which awakened the feelings and powerfully forced conviction on the mind; while that of Isocrates was, as it were, a combination of the two former. Demosthenes can scarcely be said to have adopted any individual as a model, although he bestowed so much untiring labour on the historian of the Peloponnesian War. He rather culled all that was valuable from the various styles of his great predecessors, working them up and blending them into one harmonious whole. In the general structure of many of his sentences he resembles Thucydides, but is simpler and more perspicuous and better calculated to be quickly comprehended by an audience. On the other hand, his clearness in narration and his elegance and purity of diction remind the reader of Lysias. But the argumentative parts of the speeches of Lysias are often deficient in vigour; whereas earnestness, power, zeal, rapidity, and passion, all exemplified in plain, unornamented language and a strain of close, business-like reasoning, are the distinctive characteristics of Demosthenes. The general tone of his oratory, indeed, was admirably adapted to an Athenian audience, constituted as it was of those whose habits of life were mechanical, and of those whom ambition or taste had led to 
<pb n="492" /><cb />
 the cultivation of literature. The former were captivated by strong good sense, urged with masculine force and inextinguishable spirit, and by the forcible application of plain truths; while there was enough of grace and variety to please more learned and fastidious auditors. Another very remarkable excellence of Demosthenes is the collocation of his words. The arrangement of sentences in such a manner that their cadences should be harmonious, and to a certain degree rhythmical, was a study much in vogue among the great masters of Grecian composition. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolon">Colon</ref>.</p>
 <p>The question has often been raised as to the secret of the success of Demosthenes. The universal approbation will appear the more extraordinary to a reader who for the first time peruses the orations. They do not exhibit any of that declamation on which loosely hangs the fame of so many aspirants to eloquence. There appears no deep reflection to indicate a more than ordinary penetration, or any philosophical remarks to prove the extent of his acquaintance with the great moral writers of his country. He affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in this, that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit; they were not assumed to serve an interested purpose, to be laid aside when he descended from the bema and resumed when he sought to accomplish an object, but were deeply seated in his heart and emanated from its profoundest depths. The more his country was environed by dangers, the more steady was his resolution. Nothing ever impaired the truth and integrity of his feelings or weakened his generous conviction. It was his undeviating firmness, his disdain of all compromise, that made him the first of statesmen and orators; in this lay the substance of his power, the primary foundation of his superiority; the rest was merely secondary. The mystery of his influence, then, lay in his honesty; and it is this that gave warmth and tone to his feelings, energy to his language, and an impression to his manner before which every imputation of insincerity must have immediately vanished. We may thus perceive the meaning of Demosthenes himself, when, to one who asked him what was the first requisite in an orator, he merely replied, “Delivery” (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπόκρισις</foreign>); and when asked what were the second and third requisites, gave the same answer as at first ( <title>Vit. X. Orat.</title>). His meaning was this: a lifeless manner on the part of a public speaker shows that his own feelings are not enlisted in the cause which he is advocating, and it is idle for him, therefore, to seek to make converts of others when he has failed in making one of himself. On the other hand, when the tone of voice, the gesture, the look, the whole manner of the orator, display the powerful feelings that agitate him, his emotion is communicated to his hearers, and success is inevitable. Cf. Quintil. <title>Inst. Or.</title> xi. 3 init.</p>
 <p>Of the orations we have sixty-one (half of them spurious), and fifty-six Introductions, or <foreign lang="greek">προοίμια δημηγορικά</foreign>. In confining ourselves to the classification adopted by the ancient rhetoricians, <cb /> we may arrange all these discourses under one of three heads. (I.) Deliberative discourses (<foreign lang="greek">λόγοι συμβουλεύτικοι</foreign>), treating of political topics, and delivered either before the Senate or the assembly of the people. (II.) Judicial speeches (<foreign lang="greek">λόγοι δικάνικοι</foreign>), having for their object accusation or defence. (III.) Studied or set speeches (<foreign lang="greek">λόγοι ἐπιδείκτικοι</foreign>), intended to censure or praise.</p>
 <p>Seventeen of the orations of Demosthenes belong to the first of these classes, forty-two to the second, and two to the third.</p>
 <p>Of the seventeen discourses which compose the first class, five treat of various subjects connected with the Republic, and twelve of the quarrels between the State and Philip. Our limits allow an examination of only a few of these that are most important in their character. Of the twelve harangues that turn upon the quarrels of the Republic with Philip, the first was pronounced in B.C. 351; the second, third, and fourth in B.C. 349; the fifth in B.C. 347; the sixth in B.C. 346; the seventh in B.C. 344; the eighth in B.C. 343; the ninth in B.C. 342; the tenth and eleventh in B.C. 341; and the twelfth in B.C. 340. The order here given is that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but no manuscript and no editions observe it. The manuscripts give the First, Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Philippics of Dionysius by name, and regard his fifth as forming the conclusion of the first. They give the title of Second, Third, and First Olynthiacs to his Second, Third, and Fourth. The remaining four (Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth) have the following titles: “Of Peace,” “Of Halonesus,” “Of the Chersonesus,” and “On the Letter of Philip.” We shall now speak of them in chronological order. The (1 and 2) <foreign lang="greek">Πρὸς Φιλίππον λόγος πρῶτος</foreign>, the First Philippic. Demosthenes here exhorts his fellow-citizens to prosecute the war with the greatest vigour against Philip. This monarch had, after the defeat of the Phocians, assumed a threatening attitude, as if wishing to establish himself in their country. The discourse we are now considering has been divided into two parts, which, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, were pronounced at different times; but this opinion is contradicted by most critics. (3, 4, 5) <foreign lang="greek">Ὀλυνθιακός Α, Β, Γ</foreign>—The three Olynthiacs. Their object is to stimulate the Athenians to succour Olynthus and prevent its falling into the hands of Philip.</p>
 <p>(6) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῆς εἰρήνης</foreign>, “Of the Peace.” Philip having obtained a seat in the council of the Amphictyons, Demosthenes advises his countrymen to preserve the peace with this prince. Libanius thinks that this discourse, though written by Demosthenes, was never delivered. Modern scholars are, however, of a different opinion.</p>
 <p>(7) <foreign lang="greek">Κατὰ Φιλίππου λόγος Β</foreign>, the Second Philippic, pronounced after the return of Demosthenes from the Peloponnesus, where he had negotiated a peace between Sparta and Messenia.</p>
 <p>(8) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῆς Ἁλονήσου</foreign>, “Of Halonesus,” or, rather, of a letter of Philip's, by which he makes a present to the Athenians of the island of Halonesus, which he had taken from the pirates, and demands of the Athenians to share with them the office of protecting the seas. Demosthenes strenuously opposes so insulting an offer; it is, however, far from certain whether he ever pronounced such a discourse as this. Libanius says that the ancient critics ascribed it to Hegesippus, the friend of Demosthenes. Suidas and the author of the <title>Etymologicum Magnum</title> agree with him.
<pb n="493" /><cb /></p>
 <p>(9) <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῶν ἐν Χερρονήσῳ πραγμάτων, ἤ ὁ περὶ Διοπείθεους</foreign>, “Of the events in the Chersonesus, or of Diopithes.” That general, sent at the head of a colony into the Chersonesus, had committed hostilities against the city of Cardia, the only one which Philip had reserved for himself in the conditions of peace. Diopithes had even made an inroad into Macedonia. Philip insisted on his being punished. Demosthenes undertakes in this oration to justify the conduct of the Athenian commander.</p>
 <p>(10) <foreign lang="greek">Κατὰ Φιλίππου λόγος Γ</foreign>, the Third Philippic. The progress which Philip had made in Thrace, where he was preparing to lay siege to the cities of Perinthus and Byzantium, form the subject of this harangue.</p>
 <p>(11) <foreign lang="greek">Κατὰ Φιλίππου λόγος Δ</foreign>, the Fourth Philippic, pronounced at the time when Philip had raised the siege of Perinthus, in order to fall upon Byzantium. Valckenaer (<title>Or. De Phil.</title> p. 250), Wolf (<title>Ad Lept. Proleg.</title> p. lx.), and Bekker do not acknowledge this as a production of Demosthenes.</p>
 <p>(12) <foreign lang="greek">Ὁ πρὸς τὴν ἐπιστολὴν Φιλίππου λόγος</foreign>, “On the Letter of Philip.” The letter of the king, to which this harangue refers, still exists. It contains many complaints, but no declaration of war. Taylor, Reiske, Valckenaer, and Bekker consider this letter to be spurious.</p>
 <p>We come now to the second class of the orations of Demosthenes, namely, those of a judicial nature; and here a distinction must be made between those which refer to affairs connected with the State and those which relate to individual interests: in the former case, the procedure was called <foreign lang="greek">κατηγορία</foreign>; in the second, <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign>—words which may be translated by “accusation” and “pleadings.” Of the first species we have twelve harangues remaining, the most important one of which is that entitled <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Στεφάνου</foreign>, “On the Crown.” Demosthenes had been twice crowned in the theatre during the Dionysiac festival: the first time after the expulsion of the Macedonian garrisons from the island of Euboea, and again after the alliance with the Thebans. In the year B.C. 338, Ctesiphon, who was then president of the Senate, had a decree passed by this body that, if the people approved, Demosthenes should be crowned at the approaching Dionysiac festival, in the public theatre, as a recompense for the disinterested manner in which he had filled various offices, and for the services which he had never for a moment ceased to render the State. This matter had to be confirmed by a <foreign lang="greek">ψήφισμα</foreign>, or decree of the people; but, before it was brought before them, Aeschines presented himself as the accuser of Ctesiphon. He charged him with having violated the laws in proposing to crown a public functionary before the latter had given an account of the manner in which he had discharged his office; and to crown him, too, in the theatre, instead of the senate-house or the Pnyx, where this could alone be done; finally, in having alleged what was false, for the purpose of favouring Demosthenes. He concluded by demanding that a fine of fifty talents be imposed upon Ctesiphon. The matter remained for some time pending, in consequence of the troubles that followed the battle of Chaeronea. When, however, the influence of the Macedonian party had, through the exertions of Antipater, gained the ascendency in Athens, Aeschines believed it to be a favourable moment for the revival of his accusation. It was brought forward, therefore, again, <cb /> in B.C. 330, or eight years after the proposition of Ctesiphon had been made. Aeschines thereupon pronounced his famous harangue, to which Demosthenes replied. This speech of Demosthenes is regarded, and justly so, not only as his masterpiece, but as the most perfect specimen that eloquence has ever produced. It is said that after this discourse Demosthenes no longer appeared as a public speaker. Ulpian, in his commentary on the oration <title>De Corona</title>, relates an anecdote which has been often cited. Demosthenes is endeavouring to fix the charge of bribery on Aeschines, whom he represents as corrupted by Philip and by Alexander, and consequently their hireling and not their friend or guest. Of this assertion he declares his willingness to submit the truth to the judgment of the assembly. “I call thee,” says the orator, “the hireling, first of Philip and now of Alexander; and all these who are here present agree in opinion with me. If thou disbelievest it, ask them the question; but no, I will ask them myself. Athenians, does Aeschines appear to you in the light of a hireling or a friend of Alexander's?” In putting this question, Demosthenes purposely commits a fault of accentuation: he places the accent improperly on the antepenultima, instead of the last syllable, of <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτός</foreign>—in the words of Ulpian, <foreign lang="greek">ἑκὼν ἐβαρβάρισεν</foreign>—in order to draw the attention of the people from the question to the pronunciation. This had the desired effect: the accurate ears of the Athenians were struck with the mistake; to correct it, they called out <foreign lang="greek">μισθωτός, μισθωτός</foreign>, “a hireling! a hireling!” from every part of the assembly. Pretending to receive the word as the expression of their sentiments on the guilt of Aeschines, he cried out, “Dost thou hear what they say?”</p>
 <p>The simple pleadings (<foreign lang="greek">δίκαι</foreign>) relative to matters of private interest, constitute the second class of judicial actions. Of these we have thirty remaining, which are as follows: (1) Discourses having relation to the proceedings instituted by Demosthenes against his guardians. They are five in number: of these, two are against Aphobus, and two against Onetor, his brother.</p>
 <p>(2) <foreign lang="greek">Λόγοι παραγράφικοι</foreign>, or, as Cicero (<title>De Invent.</title> 1, 8) calls them, <seg lang="la">constitutiones translativae.</seg> We have seven discourses of this class from the pen of Demosthenes, viz.: against Zenothemis, against Apaturius, against Lacritus, against Phormion, against Pantaenetus, against Nausimachus, and Xenopithaea.</p>
 <p>(3) Discourses relative to the rights of succession and to questions of dower. These are four in number: against Macartatus, against Leochares, against Spudias, against Boeotus for his mother's dowry.</p>
 <p>(4) Discourses in matters of commerce and of debt. These are three in number: against Calippus, against Nicostratus, against Timotheus.</p>
 <p>(5) Actions for indemnity and for damages (<foreign lang="greek">βλάβη, αἰκία</foreign>). The discourses under this head are five in number: against Boeotus, against Olympiodorus, against Conon , against Dionysiodorus, against Callicles.</p>
 <p>(6) Actions for perjury: two discourses against Stephanus, and one against Euergus and Mnesibulus.</p>
 <p>(7) Three discourses on the subject of the <foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις</foreign> (q. v.), or exchange of estates. The discourses under this head are the following: against Phoenippus, against Polycles, and respecting the crown of the trierarchia. It is unnecessary to speak of each of these thirty pleadings; a few 
<pb n="494" /><cb />
 remarks on some of them must suffice. The five discourses which Demosthenes pronounced against his guardians contain valuable details respecting his youth, his fortune, and the Athenian laws. Aphobus, one of the guardians, was condemned to pay Demosthenes the sum of ten talents. It does not appear whether he brought the two other guardians to trial or not. These discourses have some resemblance to those of Isaeus , his master. The <foreign lang="greek">παραγραφή</foreign> for Phormio against Apollodorus has furnished occasion for a reproach to the memory of Demosthenes. We are told by Plutarch that Demosthenes “wrote an oration for Apollodorus, by which he carried his cause against the general Timotheus, in an action for debt to the public treasury; as also those others against Phormio and Stephanus, which formed a just exception against his character. For he composed likewise the oration which Phormio had pronounced against Apollodorus. This, therefore, was like furnishing the enemies with weapons out of the same shop.”</p>
 <p>The discourse against Macartatus, respecting the succession of Hagnias, is interesting from the circumstance of our having the defence of Macartatus by Isaeus , and from our being thus able to compare the pupil with his former master. It remains to speak of the third class of Demosthenes's orations, the <foreign lang="greek">λόγοι ἐπιδεικτικοί</foreign>, “studied or set speeches.” We have only two remaining, and these, very probably, are spurious. The one, <foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτάφιος λόγος</foreign>, is a eulogy on the Athenians who had perished at Chaeronea; the other, <foreign lang="greek">ἐρωτικός λόγος</foreign>, is written in praise of the beauty of the young Epicrates.</p>
 <p>There are also six letters ascribed to Demosthenes; five of them are addressed to the people of Athens. All, however, are forgeries.</p>
 <p>Good <ref type="cross" target="crossmanuscripts">manuscripts</ref> of Demosthenes are rare, but several of them are as old as the eleventh century, and most of them contain a very large portion, if not the whole, of the extant works. In all, there are some 170 MSS. They are divided by editors into three groups, of which the first is headed by a Codex Parisinus (S or <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>) of the tenth or eleventh century, distinguished by remarkable omissions in the text; the second is headed by a Marcianus Venetus (F) and another Codex Parisinus (<foreign lang="greek">γ</foreign>), both of the eleventh century; the third by a Codex Monacensis (A), also of the eleventh century, distinguished by curious simplifications of hard passages. Editors are not entirely agreed as to the value of S or <foreign lang="greek">Σ</foreign>, some maintaining that it gives the authentic text, others believing that it gives an edition by a clever scholar. The scholia on Demosthenes are inferior, the best being those in C. Müller <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1846-47)</bibl> and <bibl default="NO"><title>Scholia Graeca in Demosth.</title> (Oxford, 1851)</bibl>.

 <p>(2) An Athenian general, son of Alcisthenes, who obtained considerable reputation during a part of the Peloponnesian War. When the Spartan monarch Agis made an inroad into Attica, Demosthenes, on his part, harassed the coasts of the Peloponnesus, and seized upon and fortified the Messenian Pylos. This led to the affair of <ref type="cross" target="crosssphacteria">Sphacteria</ref> (q.v.), in which he had a conspicuous, or, rather, the principal share. He was afterwards sent with an armament to the relief of Nicias before Syracuse; but, by his precipitate measures there, brought defeat upon himself and the consequent ruin of the whole expedition. Demosthenes and Nicias were both put to death while in prison, notwithstanding the endeavours of the Spartan commander Gylippus to save their lives. Another account, alluded to by Plutarch, makes them to have been stoned to death ( <bibl n="Thuc.  4. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.iv. 3</bibl> foll.; Plut. <title>Nic.</title>).

 <p>(3) A Greek physician, a disciple of Alexander Philalethes, who obtained the same surname as his master—namely, Philalethes, or “Lover of Truth.” He flourished about the commencement of our era, and turned his attention particularly to diseases of the eye. We have some fragments remaining of his writings on this subject, which appear to have formed part of a work often cited by Galen, Oribasius, and Aëtius.

<div2 id="crossdemus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Demus">Demus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δῆμος</foreign>). A word which originally denoted a district or country. Then, because in the early days the lower classes lived in the country and the nobles in the city, it received the meaning of commons or common people. A third use, likewise derived from the original signification, is seen in its application to the local divisions, or townships as it were, of Attica.</p>
 <p>A certain number of these <foreign lang="greek">δῆμοι</foreign>, or demes, were included in each of the ten tribes established by Clisthenes to replace the four old Ionic tribes. Their exact number at that time is not positively known, though it is supposed by some, from a statement of Herodotus (v. 69), to have been one hundred. In the third century before Christ, at all events, they numbered one hundred and seventyfour ( <bibl n="Strab.  9. 396" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.ix. 396</bibl>). The names of one hundred and forty-five of these are known to us from inscriptions. If, however, we consider the division of some demes into <foreign lang="greek">καθύπερθεν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ὑπένερθεν</foreign>, and of others between two different tribes, this sum is increased to one hundred and fifty-six (Milchhoefer, <title>Untersuchungen über die Demenordnung des Kleisthenes</title>, pp. 8-10; <title>C. I. A.</title> iii. index). The names were derived in part from places, as in the case of Acharnae, Rhamnus, etc., and in part from the founders of the demes, as in the case of Erchia and of Daedalidae (Aristot. <title>Athen. Polit.</title> 21). The largest deme, according to Thucydides, was Acharnae, which in the Peloponnesian War was able to furnish three thousand heavily armed troops ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 19</bibl><bibl n="Thuc.  20" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc., 20</bibl>).</p>
 <p>At the time of his reforms Clisthenes admitted many resident aliens and even slaves to citizenship (Aristot. <title>Polit.</title> 3, 2), and to this fact is due that alteration in the official designation of citizens which he also introduced (Aristot. <title>Athen. Polit.</title> 21). They were no longer designated by the father's name only, but also by the name of the deme to which they belonged. The demes now became the centres of the local administrative power, and are said by Aristotle to have taken the place of the <hi rend="italic">naucraries</hi> (<title>Athen. Polit.</title> 21). Each deme had its register of citizens, its own property, its own meetings and religious observances, and its own demarch. This officer made out the lists of the deme's property, kept in his possession the lexiarchic register, or register of qualified citizens, and convened the demesmen at will (Harpocration, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Δήμαρχος</foreign>). At these meetings the public business of the deme was transacted, such as the leasing of property, the election of officers, the revision of the lexiarchic register, and the enrolment of new members.</p>
 <p>When a man was first admitted to citizenship he had the right to choose his own tribe and deme, but otherwise a man belonged to the same deme as his natural or adoptive father. The legitimate children of citizens could be enrolled on attaining their majority at the age of eighteen, and adopted children, whenever presented by their adoptive fathers. The enrolment took place in the presence of the assembled demesmen. If any member questioned the candidate's eligibility the matter was settled by a majority vote of those present (Demosth. <bibl default="NO"><title>Eubul.</title> 1318</bibl>). Illegal registration, however, was not uncommon, and certain demes, as Potamus for example, were notorious for this abuse <cb /> (Harpocration, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Ποταμός</foreign>; Demosth. <bibl default="NO"><title>Leoch.</title> 1091</bibl>). To counteract this evil an official investigation of those inscribed in the register, called <hi rend="italic">diapsephisis</hi> (Harpocration, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">Διαψήφισις</foreign>), was held at various times by the deme. A similar examination was also held if, by any chance, the lexiarchic registers were lost or destroyed (Demosth. <bibl default="NO"><title>Eubul.</title> 1306</bibl>). If any one in the course of this inquiry was disfranchised by vote of the demesmen, he had the right of appeal to the courts. If the decision of the deme were sustained he was sold as a slave and his property was confiscated. But were he successful in his suit his name was restored to the register of the deme (<bibl n="Isaeus  12" default="NO" valid="yes">Isaeus, 12</bibl>; <bibl default="NO"><title>Argum. ad Demosthenis Eubul.</title> 1298</bibl>).</p>
 <p>A man was not obliged to reside within the limits of the deme of which he was a member. But he could only hold property in another deme upon payment to the demarch of a tax, called <foreign lang="greek">ἐγκτητικόν</foreign>. This tax, however, was sometimes remitted by the demes in the case of individuals to whom they desired to grant special privileges or honours (<title>C. I. A.</title> ii. 589).

<div2 id="crossdepositum" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Deposĭtum">Depositum</head>

 <p> A real contract which consists in one man intrusting a movable thing to another to keep until it is demanded back, and without any reward for the trouble of keeping it. The 
<pb n="497" /><cb />
 party who makes the <seg lang="la">depositum</seg> is called <seg lang="la">deponens</seg> or <seg lang="la">depositor</seg>, and he who receives the thing is called <seg lang="la">depositarius.</seg> The main object of a depositum is to benefit the <seg lang="la">deponens</seg> and not the <seg lang="la">depositarius.</seg> Accordingly the <seg lang="la">depositarius</seg> has, as a rule, no right to make use of the thing deposited, the contract by which one person lends a thing to another for his gratuitous use being <seg lang="la">commodatum</seg> and not depositum. The <seg lang="la">deponens</seg> is benefited by the depositum without being obliged to give anything in return. If money is promised to a person for taking care of a thing, the contract is <seg lang="la">locatio conductio</seg> and not depositum. If anything else except money is promised, the contract is one of the <seg lang="la">innominati contractus.</seg></p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">depositarius</seg> is bound on demand to restore the thing deposited to the <seg lang="la">deponens</seg>, or to the person to whom the <seg lang="la">deponens</seg> has ordered it to be restored. If he cannot restore it, or cannot restore it uninjured, he is liable, should such loss or injury be due to his wilful misconduct (<seg lang="la">dolus</seg>), or to gross negligence (<seg lang="la">culpa lata</seg>), which is equivalent to wilful misconduct; but he is not liable on account of ordinary negligence (<seg lang="la">culpa levis</seg>), except under special circumstances, as that he has agreed to undertake such liability or has benefited in some way by the contract. The remedy by which the <seg lang="la">deponens</seg> could enforce these obligations is the <seg lang="la">actio depositi directa.</seg></p>
 <p>Roman law recognized an irregular kind of deposit, which consists in depositing “fungible” things, such as money, with another person, on the understanding that an equal quantity of things of the same kind shall be restored and not the identical things deposited, as in an ordinary deposit. In this case the <seg lang="la">depositarius</seg> has the use of the things deposited, the property in them passing to him; consequently he is subject to all risk of loss. This transaction is distinguished from a loan (<seg lang="la">mutuum</seg>) by the fact that it is entered into in the interest of the person who makes over the things, and not in that of the person who receives them.

 exhibited these feats of horsemanship ( <title>Iul.</title> 39). Among other nations this species of equestrian dexterity was applied to the purposes of war.

<div2 id="crossdeucalion" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Deucalion">Deucalion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δευκαλίων</foreign>). The son of Prometheus and Clymené, or of Prometheus and Pandora, and sometimes called the father ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 3</bibl>), sometimes the brother of Hellen, the reputed founder of the Greek nation. His home was Thessaly, from which, according to general tradition, he was driven to Parnassus by a great deluge ( <bibl n="Apollod.  1.7.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.i.7.2</bibl>), which, however, according to Aristotle (<title>Meteorol.</title> i. 14) occurred between Dodona and the Acheloüs. The Greek legend respecting this memorable event is as follows: Deucalion was married to Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora. When Zeus designed to destroy the brazen race of men on account of their impiety, Deucalion, by the advice of his father, made himself an ark (<foreign lang="greek">λάρναξ</foreign>), and, putting provisions into it, entered it with his wife Pyrrha. Zeus then poured rain from heaven and inundated the greater part of Greece, so that all the people, except a few who escaped to the lofty mountains, perished in the waves. At the same time, the mountains of Thessaly were burst through by the flood, and all Greece without the Isthmus, as well as all the Peloponnesus, were overflowed. Deucalion was carried along the sea in his ark for nine days and nights, until he reached Mount Parnassus. By this time the rain had ceased, and, leaving his ark, he sacrificed to Zeus the flight-giver (<foreign lang="greek">Φύξιος</foreign>), who sent Hermes, desiring him to ask what he would. His request was to have the earth replenished with men. By the direction of Zeus, thereupon, he and his wife flung stones behind them, and those which Deucalion cast became men, and those thrown by Pyrrha women; <cb /> from which circumstance the Greeks derived the name for “people” (<foreign lang="greek">λαός</foreign>) from <foreign lang="greek">λᾶας</foreign>, “a stone” ( <bibl n="Apollod.  1.7.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.i.7.2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>This narrative restricts the general deluge to Greece proper, perhaps originally to Thessaly; and it most incongruously represents others as having escaped as well as Deucalion; while at the same time, it intimates that he and his wife alone had been preserved in the catastrophe. The circumstance of the ark is thought by some to be borrowed from the Mosaic account, and to have been learned at Alexandria, for we elsewhere find the dove noticed. “The mythologists,” says Plutarch, “inform us that a dove let fly out of the ark was to Deucalion a sign of bad weather if it came in again, of good weather if it flew away” ( <title>De Sollert. An.</title>). The sacrifice and the appearance of Hermes likewise strongly remind us of Noah. (See, also, the article <ref type="cross" target="crossapamea">Apamea</ref>.) The Latin writers take a different view of the deluge. According to them it overspread the whole earth, and all animal life perished except Deucalion and Pyrrha, whom Ovid, who gives a very poetical account of this great catastrophe, conveys in a small boat to the summit of Parnassus; while others make Aetna or Athos the mountain which yielded them a refuge (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

According to Ovid they consulted the ancient oracle of Themis respecting the restoration of mankind, and received the following response: “Depart from the fane, veil your heads, loosen your girded vestments, and cast behind you the great bones of your parent” ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 1. 381" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>i. 381</bibl> foll.). They were at first horror-struck at such an act of impiety, but at length Deucalion understood the words of the oracle as referring to the earth, the common mother of all. Rationalizing mythologists make the story an allegory in which Deucalion represents water (as if from <foreign lang="greek">δεύω</foreign>), and Pyrrha, fire (<foreign lang="greek">πῦρ</foreign>). The meaning of the legend will then be, that when the passage through which the Peneus carries off the waters that run into the vale of Thessaly, which is on all sides shut in by lofty mountains, had been closed by some accident, they overflowed the whole of its surface, till the action of subterranean fire opened a way for them. According to this view of the subject, then, the deluge of Deucalion was merely a local one; and it was not until the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, when the Hebrew Scriptures became known to the Greeks, that some features borrowed from the universal deluge of Noah were incorporated into the story of the Thessalian flood.

<head orig="Diaetetĭca">Diaetetica</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διαιτητική</foreign>). One of the principal branches into which the ancients divided the art and science of medicine. The word is derived from <foreign lang="greek">δίαιτα</foreign>, which meant much the same as our word diet. It is defined by Celsus (<title>De Medic.</title>  Praef.lib. i.) to signify that part of medicine which cures diseases by means of regimen and diet. Taken strictly in this sense, it would correspond very nearly with the modern “dietetics,” and this is the meaning which it always bears in the earlier medical writers.</p>
 <p>In later times the comic poet Nicomachus ( <bibl n="Acus. Fr. 1" default="NO"> <title>Fr.</title>1</bibl><bibl n="Acus. Fr. 30" default="NO"> Fr., 30</bibl>M. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> <bibl n="Ath.  7." default="NO">Ath.vii.</bibl> p. 291 c) introduces a cook who, among his other qualifications, implies that he is a physician; but no attention seems to have been paid to eating as a branch of medicine before the date of Hippocrates. Homer represents Machaon, who had been wounded in the shoulder by an arrow ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 507" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 507</bibl>) and forced to quit the field, as taking a draught composed of wine, goat's-milk cheese, and flour, which probably no surgeon in later times would have prescribed in such a case. Hippocrates seems to claim for himself the credit of being the first person who had studied this subject, and says that “the ancients had written nothing on it worth mentioning” (<title>De Rat. Vict. in Morb. Acut.</title> 1, vol. ii. p. 26, ed. Kühn). Among the works forming the Hippocratic collection, there are four that bear upon this subject, of which, however, only one (viz. that just quoted) is considered to be undoubtedly genuine. It would be out of place here to attempt anything like a complete account of the opinions of the ancients on this point, so that in this article only such particulars are mentioned as may be supposed to have some interest for the classical reader.</p>
 <p>In the works of Hippocrates and his successors almost all the articles of food used by the ancients are mentioned, and their real or supposed properties discussed, sometimes quite as fancifully as by Burton in his <title>Anatomy of Melancholy.</title> In some respects they appear to have been much less delicate than the moderns, as we find the flesh of the fox, the dog, the horse, and the ass spoken of as common articles of food. Beef and mutton were of course eaten, but the meat most generally esteemed was pork (see Oribas. <title>Coll. Med.</title> i. p. 585, Daremberg). A morbid taste for human flesh appears to have been secretly indulged in the time of Xenocrates (first century A.D.); so that the unnatural practice was forbidden by an imperial edict, which decree serves to illustrate the “strange and revolting anecdote,” as Milman calls it, of the wild cry that, in a time of scarcity amounting to famine, assailed the ears of the emperor Attalus, “Fix the tariff for human flesh” (<seg lang="la">pone pretium carni humanae</seg>, Zosim. vi. 11).</p>
 <p>With regard to the strength or quality of the wine drunk by the ancients, we may arrive at something like certainty from the fact that Coelius Aurelianus mentions it as something extraordinary that Asclepiades at Rome in the first century B.C. sometimes ordered his patients to double and treble the quantity of wine, till at last they drank half wine and half water (<title>De Morb. Chron.</title> ii. 7, p. 386). From this it appears that wine was commonly diluted with five or six times its quantity of water. Hippocrates also in particular cases recommends wine to be mixed with an equal quantity of water, and Galen approves of the proportion. According to Hippocrates, the proportions <cb /> in which wine and water should be mixed together vary according to the season of the year; for instance, in summer the wine should be most diluted, in winter the least so. In one place the patient after great fatigue is recommended to get himself drunk once or twice, in which passage it has been doubted whether actual intoxication is meant or only the “drinking freely and to cheerfulness,” in which sense the same word is used by St. John (ii. 10) and the Septuagint (Gen. xliii. 34; Cant. v. 1; and perhaps Gen. ix. 21).</p>
 <p>Exercises of various kinds and bathing are also much insisted on by the writers on diet and regimen, but for further particulars on these subjects the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">Balneae</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossgymnasium">Gymnasium</ref> must be consulted. It may, however, be added that the bath could not have been very common, at least in private families, in the time of Hippocrates, as he says that “there are few houses in which the necessary conveniences are to be found” (<title>De Rat. Vict. in Morb. Acut.</title> 18).</p>
 <p>Another very favourite practice with the ancients, both as a preventive of sickness and as a remedy, was the taking of an emetic from time to time. In one of the treatises of the Hippocratic collection the unknown author recommends it two or three times a month. Celsus considers it more beneficial in the winter than in the summer (<title>De Medic.</title> i. 3, p. 28), and says that those who take an emetic twice a month had better do so on two successive days than once a fortnight. In the first century B.C. this practice was so commonly abused that Asclepiades rejected the use of emetics altogether. See Plin. <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 26.  17." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxvi. 17.</bibl></p>
 <p>It was the custom among the Romans to take an emetic immediately before their meals, in order to prepare themselves to eat more plentifully; and again soon after, so as to avoid any injury from repletion. Cicero, in his account of the day that Caesar spent with him at his house in the country (<title>Ad Att.</title> xiii. 52), says, “Accubuit, <foreign lang="greek">ἐμετικὴν</foreign> agebat (<seg lang="la">he was meditating an emetic</seg>), itaque et edit et bibit <foreign lang="greek">ἀδεῶς</foreign> et iucunde”; and this has by some persons been considered a sort of compliment paid by Caesar to his host, as it intimated a resolution to pass the day cheerfully and to eat and drink freely. He is represented as having done the same thing when he was entertained by King Deiotarus ( <title>Pro Deiot.</title> 7. 21). The glutton Vitellius is said to have preserved his own life by constant emetics, while he destroyed all his companions who did not use the same precaution; so that one of them, who was prevented by illness from dining with him for a few days, said, “I should certainly have been dead if I had not fallen sick” (Dio Cass. lxv. 2). It might truly be said, in the strong language of Seneca, <title>Vomunt, ut edant; edunt, ut vomant</title> (<title>Cons. ad Helv.</title> 9. 10; cf. <title>De Provid.</title> 3. 11; <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 95. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>95. 21</bibl>). By some, the practice was thought so effectual for strengthening the constitution that it was the constant regimen of all the <seg lang="la">athletae</seg>, or professed wrestlers, trained for the public shows, in order to make them more robust. Celsus, however, warns his readers against the too frequent use of emetics without necessity and merely for luxury and gluttony, and says that no one who has any regard for his health and wishes to live to old age ought to make it a daily practice. See Saalfeld, <bibl default="NO"><title>Küche und Keller in AltRom</title> (Berlin, 1883)</bibl>; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossathletae">Athletae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscena">Cena</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmedicina">Medicina</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvictus">Victus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossvinum">Vinum</ref>.

It is expressly asserted by ancient writers that when, in a particular instance, he saw a perjured person escape punishment, he publicly declared his disbelief of Divine Providence, and from that time spoke of the gods and all religious ceremonies with ridicule and contempt. He even attempted to lay open the sacred Mysteries, writing two books on the subject, called <foreign lang="greek">Φρύγιοι</foreign>.

Aulus Gellius (iii. 15) informs us that he saw his three sons crowned on the same day at the Olympic Games and expired through joy.

<head orig="Dialects">Dialects</head>

 <p> A dialect, in the usual acceptance of the word, is a form of speech used by a limited number of people, or within a limited region, and differing from the language of the main branch of the race by reason of local usages due to separation and special conditions. The term also denotes any of the divisions of a linguistic family. It sometimes happens that those who use a particular dialect of a language come to be politically the most powerful branch, with greater wealth, refinement, and literary cultivation. Their dialect then ultimately becomes the standard form of the language, while the other variations of it sink to a subordinate position, and are then spoken of as <hi rend="italic">dialects</hi>, and the first, which was originally of no more authority, is accepted as the normal form of speech. Thus, Latin became the great standard language of Italy, while its sister languages, Umbrian and Oscan, sank to the position of dialects. Thus, too, in England, the so-called Middle English, being spoken in that part of the country where the two great universities were situated, and being used by the early writers of the country, gradually became the tongue of the educated all over England and the literary form of speech, while the Northern English and the Southern English ceased to be heard except in the mouths of the uneducated. In Greek, the finest productions of literature were, on the whole, those of the Ionic Greeks, so that a form of the Ionic dialect (Attic) became the standard with which all others were compared, though the Doric and Aeolic, being used by many famous writers, never became, like Lowland Scotch or the Sussex speech in England, discredited and vulgar. Dialectic differences when perpetuated and intensified by continued separation and lack of intercourse between the peoples who use them <cb /> at last develop into different languages. See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Greek Dialects</hi>.—The three main divisions of the dialects of Greece are usually said to be the Aeolic, Ionic, and Doric. The exact lines of division are, however, obscure, for one dialect often borrows from another when spoken by contiguous peoples. It must be remembered, also, that the racial divisions of the Greeks do not always coincide with the dialectic divisions; that there were hundreds of minor dialects of which no account can be taken here; and that these dialects shaded off one into the other by almost imperceptible gradations. Scholars differ most as to what dialects are to be called Aeolic, some restricting the name to the Lesbian and Asiatic. Brugmann classes Northwest Greek (of Phocis, Locris, Aetolia, Acarnania, Phthiotis, and Epirus), Elean, Arcadian-Cyprian, and Pamphylian as separate dialects (<title>Comp. Gram.</title> i. p. 6).</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps"> Aeolic</hi>.—The Aeolic dialect was spoken in Macedonia, North Thessaly, Boeotia, Arcadia (?), Elis, Cyprus, and the northern part of Asiatic Hellas. Our knowledge of the <title>Lesbio-Aeolic</title> comes partly from inscriptions and partly from the fragments of Alcaeus and Sappho quoted by the grammarians and others, and from the statements of the grammarians themselves. Three of its inscriptions are of great importance—one found at Mitylené recording the return of certain exiles in the time of Alexander the Great (<title>C. I. G.</title> 2166), one found at Pordoselena (<title>C. I. G.</title> 2166 <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>), and a third found at Eresus (edited by Conze and Sauppe). The chief peculiarities of the Aeolic dialect are (1) a strong tendency to barytone pronunciation (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">σόφος, θῦμος, Ἀχίλλευς</foreign>, for <foreign lang="greek">σοφός, θυμός, Ἀχιλλεύς</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(2) the retention of the <ref type="cross" target="crossdigamma">digamma</ref> (q.v.);</p>
 <p>(3) the loss of the dual; a second singular ending -<foreign lang="greek">σθα</foreign> in verbs (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">ἔχεισθα</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(4) a third plural ending in -<foreign lang="greek">ισι</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(5) <foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign> appears as <foreign lang="greek">σδ</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(6) the absence of the rough breathing. Its general character was lightness and rapidity of utterance; the Aeolic poets abound in anapaests and dactyls. The Athenians regarded the Lesbian language as somewhat barbaric ( <title>Protag.</title> 341 C.). The <title>Thessalian-Aeolic</title>, which is known to us by a few inscriptions only, is a sort of bridge between the Lesbian and the Boeotian (Collitz), doubling the liquids, changing <seg lang="la">a</seg> to <seg lang="la">o</seg>, and using an infinitive in -<foreign lang="greek">μεν</foreign>. The <title>Boeotian-Aeolic</title> is known from inscriptions and from the fragments of Corinna, though in these it is mixed with Ionic forms, as is also true of the Boeotian passages in the <title>Acharnians</title> of Aristophanes. The Boeotian-Aeolic differed from the Lesbian chiefly in the following particulars: (1) In not throwing back the accent;</p>
 <p>(2) in a fondness for aspiration;</p>
 <p>(3) in retaining <foreign lang="greek">τ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θ</foreign> where the Lesbian changes it to <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(4) in using <foreign lang="greek">δδ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">σδ</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">ζ</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(5) in allowing the uncontracted -<foreign lang="greek">αο</foreign> and -<foreign lang="greek">αων</foreign> to stand;</p>
 <p>(6) in using such genitives as <foreign lang="greek">ἐμοῦς, τεοῦς</foreign>, for which the Lesbian has <foreign lang="greek">ἔμεθεν, σέθεν</foreign>. (See Beerman in Curtius's <title>Studien</title>, ix. p. 85.) The <title>Elean-Aeolic</title> is known from several inscriptions, such as the bronze plate found at Olympia by Gell (<title>C. I. G.</title> 11) and the inscription of Damocrates (Kirchhoff in the <bibl default="NO"><title>Archaeol. Zeit.</title> 1876</bibl>). The <title>Arcadian-Aeolic</title> is nearer to the Doric than to the Lesbian in its forms. It has -<foreign lang="greek">αυ</foreign> for the gen. sing. masc. of a-nouns, -<foreign lang="greek">οι</foreign> as a dative (or locative) sing. of o-nouns, <foreign lang="greek">ἰν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">εἰς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἐν</foreign>, and -<foreign lang="greek">τοι</foreign> as a third sing. middle ending (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">γένητοι</foreign>). (See Schrader in Curtius's <title>Studien</title>, x. pp. 273-280.) The <title>Cyprian</title> dialect is probably at the bottom Arcadian-Aeolic 
<pb n="502" /><cb /> (<bibl n="Hdt.  7. 90" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 90</bibl>; Pausan. viii. 5, 2)—a theory strengthened by the study of the Cypriote inscriptions by Birch, Deecke, Siegismund, Hall, Voigt, and others. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscyprus">Cyprus</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">B. Doric</hi>.—The Doric dialect was used in Doris, Argos, Laconia, Messenia, Crete, Sicily, Lower Italy (Magna Graecia), and the southern part of Asiatic Hellas. Ahrens recognizes two types—the severer Doric (spoken in Laconia, Crete, Cyrené, and Magna Graecia); and the milder Doric, influenced by Aeolic or Ionic usage (spoken in Argolis, Messenia, Megara, northern Greece, Asia Minor, and Sicily). It was used by the bucolic poets (Theocritus, Bion , Moschus), and by Pindar, Alcman, and others. Its principal features are (1) a tendency to use <foreign lang="greek">α_</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> and for <foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(2) the use of -<foreign lang="greek">μες</foreign> (for -<foreign lang="greek">μεν</foreign>) as a first plural verbal ending;</p>
 <p>(3) the use of -<foreign lang="greek">ντι</foreign> as a third plural ending;</p>
 <p>(4) a strong tendency to oxytones (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">ἐλέγον, ἀνθρώποι, παίδες</foreign>, for <foreign lang="greek">ἔλεγον, ἄνθρωποι, παῖδες</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(5) the use of the digamma, which it retained longer than did any other Greek dialect;</p>
 <p>(6) peculiarities of contraction, such as <foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ει, ω</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ου</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ἧς</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">εἷς, ἦμεν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ἔσμεν</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(7) the shortening of long final syllables, usually when the length is due to a compensation for the loss of a consonant (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">πός</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">πόδ-ς, λέγες</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">λέγεις, τίκτεν</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">τίκτειν</foreign>, etc.);</p>
 <p>(8) a free use of assimilation. There are many important inscriptions in Doric Greek. Chief among them are the famous Tables of Heraclea, found in the bed of the river Cavone in 1732 and 1735, and now partly in the Museo Nazionale at Naples and partly in the British Museum. Another (in the <title>Messenian-Doric</title>) was found at Andania, and though of late date (B.C. 95?) is valuable for its fulness and for some of the forms it exhibits. The <title>Megarian-Doric</title> is known from inscriptions at Byzantium; the <title>Corinthian</title> from inscriptions of Corcyra and Syracuse, both colonies of Corinth; the <title>Locrian</title> from the bronze tablet found at Oeanthia, and dating from the fourth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">b.c.;</hi> the <title>Cretan</title> from treaty-tablets and others found in Crete (see <ref type="cross" target="crossgortyn">Gortyn</ref>) and among the ruins of the Temple of Dionysus on the island of Teos. The general character of the Doric speech was slowness, deliberation, and fulness of sound, with the <foreign lang="greek">πλατειασμός</foreign> which the Dorians shared with the Boeotians.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">C. Ionic</hi>.—The character of the Ionic dialect, in its several subdivisions, gives striking evidence of its long-continued employment in literature. Its smoothness and harmony, its rich and full vowelsystem, its variety and plasticity, all mark it out as eminently fitted for noble and expressive utterance in both prose and verse. It was used by the Greeks of Attica and Ionia and in most of the islands of the Aegean Sea. Under this head we may consider (1) the Old Ionic (Epic),</p>
 <p>(2) the New Ionic,</p>
 <p>(3) the Attic, and</p>
 <p>(4) the Common Dialect (New Attic).</p>
 <p>The <title>Old Ionic</title> or <title>Epic</title> dialect is the Ionic of the poems of Homer. Strictly speaking it was not a genuine, popular form of speech in common use, but a mixed dialect, developed by the poets for artistic purposes. Its base is doubtless the spoken language of the district in which the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> were composed; but interwoven with this are forms and usages partly borrowed from other dialectic sources and partly modified by poetic license. Thus there is a strong Aeolic element in Homer, due perhaps in part to the Aeolic affinities of the Ionians of Smyrna, but cherished also because of <cb /> the exigencies of the dactylic hexameter. Every page of the Homeric poetry shows a peculiar multiplicity of forms of the same word. Thus we find <foreign lang="greek">ἵππου</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἵπποιο, μάχῃς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">μάχῃσι, ἔπεσσι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἔπεσι, ἥρωοι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ἡρώεσσι</foreign>: in the pronouns <foreign lang="greek">ἐμοῦ, ἐμεῦ, ἔμεθεν</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐμεῖο, ἄμμες</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἡμεῖς</foreign>. The augment is used or disused at pleasure, forms are contracted or not, diphthongs are shortened before succeeding vowels, the metrical value of vowels varies, both hiatus and elision are freely used—in a word, the widest license prevails and stamps the dialect as one established for the convenience of poets and not for the common use of men. “The polish of the style, the artistic perfection of the composition, and the elaborate nature of the syntax point back to a long series of years of development, during which poets and schools of poets composed and passed on by oral tradition many lays . . . which in course of time grew into more complete epic poems. Forms of speech had not then been fixed by the general use of writing; the poet willingly adopted any of the floating forms in common use around him, or caught and preserved for his purpose those older forms bequeathed by past generations: so that in this way we have an explanation of the remarkable fact that in Homeric Greek there are forms in use of such different ages—archaisms, as we might say, by the side of modernisms” (Merry). Some of the peculiarities of the Epic language, however, which were at one time ascribed to the license of the poet, are now properly recognized as the usage of the oldest Greek. The most interesting of these is the effect produced by the earlier existence of a spirant, no longer written, upon the quantity of a preceding syllable. This lost letter is sometimes <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and sometimes <foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">θεὸς</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">ως, εἰς ἅλα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">αλτο, ἔτι γὰρ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">εχον</foreign>. The same is true of the digamma, to which, indeed, as late as the time of I. Bekker all such cases were ascribed. Real examples of the influence of the digamma in making position or in preventing elision are <foreign lang="greek">φίλα ϝείματα δύσω, οὕτω δὴ ϝοἶκονδε, ἔπειτα ϝάναξ</foreign>. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdigamma">Digamma</ref>.</p>
 <p>This complex and conventional dialect founded upon an Ionic base was disseminated throughout all Greece by the rhapsodes, or public reciters, who chanted the epics at the great public assemblies and festivals. Its forms and expressions colour the compositions of authors of very different ages and various styles. It forms the basis of the lyric language of Stesichorus and Pindar; it pervades the prose of Herodotus; and it tinges the style of the early Attic dramatists with a distinctly epic hue. See <ref type="cross" target="crossepos">Epos</ref>.</p>
 <p>The <title>New Ionic</title> dialect is found in the writings of the iambic elegiac poets Archilochus, Callinus, and Mimnermus, and in the prose of Herodotus and Hippocrates. This dialect has the following distinctive peculiarities: (1) the retention of the earlier <foreign lang="greek">κ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">π</foreign> in interrogative and relative words (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">κοῖος, ὁκόσος</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(2) the interchange of <foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ου</foreign> with the simple vowels (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">εἴρομαι, ξεῖνος</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">μέζων, δέξω</foreign>; and <foreign lang="greek">μοῦνος, οὔνομα</foreign>, etc.);</p>
 <p>(3) the contraction of <foreign lang="greek">οη</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign> (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">βῶσαι, ἐννώσας</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(4) the use of <foreign lang="greek">ηϊ</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ει</foreign> (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">βασιληΐη</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(5) crasis (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">ὡνήρ, ὧλλοι</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(6) the disuse of the appended <foreign lang="greek">ν</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(7) the use of -<foreign lang="greek">αται, -ατο</foreign> for -<foreign lang="greek">νται, -ντο</foreign> whenever these are added directly to the tense-stem (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">ἀπίκαται, τιθέαται</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(8) the genitive plural in -<foreign lang="greek">εων</foreign> for the Homeric -<foreign lang="greek">άων</foreign> and Attic -<foreign lang="greek">ῶν</foreign>. 
<pb n="503" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The <title>Attic</title> dialect is probably a modification of the Ionic spoken before the founding of the Ionic colonies. It is to the student of literature the most important of all the forms of Greek, since it was used by Thucydides, Aeschylus, Xenophon, Plato, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lysias, Isocrates, Demosthenes, Aeschines, and many others of genius scarcely inferior to them. Attic occupies a middle ground between the harsher Doric and the softer Ionic, and was thus fitted to be the common speech of all cultivated Greeks, and is now used as the standard of comparison in the study of the Hellenic tongue. Literary Attic is divided into Old and New, the point of division being approximately the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (B.C. 431). The differences between the Old and the New are slight, and seem to point to a gradual adoption in literature of popular forms. The Old Ionic is seen in Thucydides and the tragedians; both the Old and the New are noticeable in Plato; while the comic writers and the orators show the usages of the New. It is in the New Attic that the Greek language reached the zenith of its grace, expressiveness, and symmetry, combining at once the <foreign lang="greek">σεμνότης</foreign> of the Doric with the <foreign lang="greek">χάρις</foreign> of the Ionic speech.</p>
 <p>The general use of the Attic gradually led to its corruption, so that we find a modified form of it developed by the time of Alexander, which is known as the <title>Common</title> dialect (<foreign lang="greek">ἡ κοινὴ διάλεκτος</foreign>). It was used by the Greek writers of later times, such as Aristotle, Polybius, Plutarch, Pausanias, Babrius, and Lucian—writers, however, who exhibit very different degrees of divergence from the Attic standard of purity.</p>
 <p>The rise of the <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref> (q.v.) of critics and grammarians did much to check the tendency to linguistic corruption in literature; but the popular speech, continually receiving additions from foreign sources and especially from the East, ultimately developed into a distinct idiom which is known as <title>Hellenistic Greek</title>, and which is the basis of the diction of the New Testament and also of the Septuagint. The variations from earlier standards exhibited in this form of speech are rather to be seen in the vocabulary than in the syntax; but the following come under the latter head: (1) a confusion in the use of moods (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">ἵνα</foreign> with the present indicative, <foreign lang="greek">ὅταν</foreign> with the past indicative);</p>
 <p>(2) a construction of cases unknown in Attic (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">γεύεσθαι</foreign> with the accusative, <foreign lang="greek">προσφωνεῖν</foreign> with the dative);</p>
 <p>(3) a gradual disuse of the optative mood, for which the subjunctive is substituted.</p>
 <p>The corruption of the spoken language went on continuously, much as in the case of the Latin. For centuries literature still struggled to preserve the usages of Attic or at least of the <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ διάλεκτος</foreign>, but at last this attempt ended, and the popular speech became also the language of literature, being first so used by Theodorus Ptochoprodromus, a monk of Constantinople, about A.D. 1160. From this date begins the history of modern Greek.</p>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. Italian Dialects</hi>.—The dialects spoken in Italy in ancient times and surely traceable to an Aryan stock may be roughly divided into two main groups—the Umbro-Sabellian and the LatinFaliscan. Their general relations and divisions are indicated in the diagram given under <ref type="cross" target="crossitalia">Italia</ref>, p. 892. Of the Umbro-Sabellian group, the principal dialects are the Umbrian and the Oscan. See <ref type="cross" target="crossosci">Osci</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossumbria">Umbria</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Latin and the Faliscan are so closely allied that the Faliscan may be roughly regarded as only a rustic variation of the Latin. It was used by the people of Falerii, a city situated within Etrurian territory, and probably one of the twelve confederated cities of the Etruscan League. That the language of the Falisci was not Etruscan or cognate with Etruscan was noticed by the ancients (e. g. Strabo, v. p. 266; Dionys. Hal. i. 21; <hi rend="italic">Cato ap.</hi> Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 3. 5. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>iii. 5. 1</bibl>), and inscriptions found in the present century have confirmed its close affinity with Old Latin. Thus the Falisci used the Latin R instead of the Etruscan and Umbro-Sabellian character <figure />, and possessed also the Old Latin Z. The principal phonetic peculiarity distinguishing the Faliscan from the Latin is the representation of an original <hi rend="italic">bh</hi> medial by <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">lofertas</hi> for <seg lang="la">libertas.</seg> See Deecke, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die Falisker</title> (Strassburg, 1885)</bibl>; and Conway's <bibl default="NO"><title>Italic Dialects</title> (announced in 1896)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Latin was originally spoken only in the plain of <ref type="cross" target="crosslatium">Latium</ref> (q.v.), and seems not to have developed any subordinate dialects. For its colloquial and rustic forms and usages, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssermo-plebeius">Sermo Plebeius</ref>. The best grammars of the language are those of Roby <bibl default="NO">(2 vols., Oxford, 1881)</bibl>; Kühner, <bibl default="NO"><title>Ausführliche Grammatik</title> (2 vols. Hanover, 1877-78)</bibl>; Stolz and Schmalz in Iwan Müller's <title>Handbuch der klassischen Alterthumswissenschaft</title>, vol. ii. <bibl default="NO">(Nördlingen, 1885)</bibl>; and Gildersleeve, revised by Lodge <bibl default="NO">(N. Y. 1894)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Besides the Latin-Faliscan and the Umbro-Sabellian, Greek was spoken in the Greek cities of southern Italy (Magna Graecia), Keltic by the Gaulish peoples in the north, Etruscan by the inhabitants of Etruria, and at one time in Campania and the plain of the Eridanus (Po); while at an early period, in the extreme southeast, inscriptions show the existence of a language whose affinities have not yet been wholly determined, but which is usually styled Messapian or Iapygian, and regarded as cognate with the language of the Veneti in the northeast of Italy.

<div2 id="crossdialogus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dialŏgus">Dialogus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διάλογος</foreign>). A dialogue. As a form of literary composition, apart from its purely dramatic use, 
<pb n="504" /><cb /> the dialogue plays an important part in the history of Greek and Roman letters. The vividness and pungency of rapid question and reply were fully appreciated by the earliest writers. The Homeric poems abound in passages whose great dramatic force is due to the use of this form. Herodotus continually employs it to give picturesqueness and life to his narrative; and this is true even of Thucydides, in whose history the so-called Melian dialogue at the close of the fifth book, the dialogue of Archidamus with the Plataeans (ii. 71-74), and of the Ambraciot herald and the Acarnanian soldiers of Demosthenes (iii. 113) are striking examples. The great popularity of the drama must have been a direct stimulus to the use of the dialogue in prose literature; so that it is not surprising to find Plato employing it in his philosophical writings, thus following the example of Alexamenus of Teos and Zeno of Elea (cf. Mahaffy, <title>Hist. of Class. Gk. Lit.</title> ii. pp. 170-174). In this way the philosophical argument is worked out in a most attractive form, the attack and defence excite a lively interest, and the reader is artfully made to accept the truth of the doctrine by witnessing, as it were, the utter overthrow of its assailants. The <foreign lang="greek">ἠθοποιΐα</foreign>, or character-painting, of the dialogues of Plato has never been surpassed, even by the greatest dramatists. The subtlest touches are here given with wonderful deftness, and a whole gallery of portraits is presented to us as varied, as delicately drawn, and as life-like as those of Euripides, of Molière, or of Shakspeare. In some of them, however (e. g. the <title>Parmenides, Protagoras</title>, and <title>Symposium</title>), the artistic mistake has been made of reporting the conversation in the <seg lang="la">oratio obliqua;</seg> and in these the sustained indirectness of construction, the crowded infinitives, and the absurdity of supposing one man to repeat from memory the whole of an intricate dialogue, greatly diminish the pleasure of the reader.</p>
 <p>The dialogues of Aristotle are very different from those of Plato, and are probably a reversion to the models of Alexamenus and Zeno. The form is still nominally that of a conversation, but in fact the <seg lang="la">diverbium</seg> appears only in the introductory parts, and after the argument is once under full headway it becomes an almost unbroken monologue. The conversational <seg lang="la">prooemium</seg> is, therefore, rather a device to secure the attention of the reader, than an essential part of the work as a whole; and the <foreign lang="greek">ἠθοποιΐα</foreign> is conspicuously absent.</p>
 <p>Such of the philosophical and rhetorical writings of Cicero as adopt the form of the dialogue are decidedly Aristotelian rather than Platonic in their arrangement and in their lack of dramatic ability. Such are the treatises <title>De Senectute, De Amicitia</title>, the <title>Brutus</title>, the <title>Tusculanae Disputationes</title>, the <title>De Oratore</title>, and the <title>De Republica.</title></p>
 <p>The so-called <title>Dialogi</title> of L. Annaeus Seneca (<title>Dialogorum Libri xii.</title>) get the name from the frequent introduction of a second speaker with the words <seg lang="la">inquis, inquit, dicet aliquis</seg>, etc., but they are in no true sense of the word dialogues at all.</p>
 <p>In Latin literature the title <ref type="cross" target="crossdialogus">Dialogus</ref> is given <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg> to a work of Tacitus (<title>Dialogus de Oratoribus</title>), a conversation between a number of literary celebrities of the time of Vespasian, who in it discuss the decay of oratory under the Empire. The style shows that the dialogue was composed at the time when the writer was in the Ciceronian period of his studies and was endeavouring <cb /> to imitate the diction of that great master. Hence it differs in many respects from the later Tacitean compositions, so that some critics from the time of Lipsius have even suspected its authenticity; but in a letter of Pliny (ix. 10<bibl n="Plin.  2" default="NO">Pliny, 2</bibl>) addressed to Tacitus is found an evident allusion to the <title>Dialogus</title>, even did not a careful study of the piece itself yield sufficient evidence of the authorship.

<head orig="Diamastigōsis">Diamastigosis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διαμαστίγωσις</foreign>). A solemnity performed at Sparta at the festival of Artemis Orthia (Pausan. iii. 16. 6). The ceremony was this: Spartan youths (<foreign lang="greek">ἔφηβοι</foreign>) were scourged on the occasion at the altar of Artemis, by persons appointed for the purpose, until their blood gushed forth and covered the altar. The scourging itself was preceded by a preparation by which those who intended to undergo the diamastigosis tried to harden themselves against its pains. Pausanias describes the origin of the worship of Artemis Orthia, and of the diamastigosis, in the following manner: A wooden statue of Artemis, which Orestes had brought from Tauris, was found in a bush by Astrabacus and Alopecus, the sons of Irbus. The two men were immediately struck mad at the sight of it. The Limnaeans and the inhabitants of other neighbouring places then offered sacrifices to the goddess; but a quarrel ensued among them, in which several individuals were killed at the altar of Artemis, who now demanded atonement for the pollution of her sanctuary. From henceforth, human victims were selected by lot and offered to Artemis, until Lycurgus introduced the scourging of young men at her altar as a substitute for human sacrifices.</p>
 <p>The diamastigosis, according to this account, was a substitute for human sacrifice, and Lycurgus made it also serve his purposes of education, in so far as he made it a part of the system of hardening the Spartan youths against bodily sufferings ( <bibl n="Plut.

<div2 id="crossdiana" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Diāna">Diana</head>

 <p> (from the root of <seg lang="la">dies</seg>). An ancient Italian deity, whose name is the feminine counterpart of Ianus (originally Dianus). She was the goddess of the moon; of the open air and open country with its mountains, forests, springs, and brooks; of the chase; and of childbirth, since the moon was believed to foster growth ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>ii. 19</bibl>). In the latter capacity she, like Iuno, bore the second title of Lucina.

The most celebrated shrine of Diana was at <ref type="cross" target="crossaricia">Aricia</ref> (q.v.), in a grove (<seg lang="la">nemus</seg>), from which she was sometimes simply called Nemorensis ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 19." default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xix.</bibl>&lt;*&gt; <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. H. N., 33</bibl>). This was on the banks of the modern lake of Nemi, which was styled the mirror of Diana. Here a male deity named Virbius (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 756" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 756</bibl>) was worshipped with her, a god of the forest and the chase. He was in later times identified with Hippolytus, the risen favourite of Artemis, and the oldest priest of the sanctuary (<title>Rex Nemorensis</title>, <title>Calig.</title> 35). 
<pb n="505" /><cb /></p>
 <p>He was said to have originated the custom of giving the priest's office to a runaway slave, who broke off a branch from a particular tree in the precincts and slew his predecessor in office in single combat. In consequence of this murderous custom the Greeks compared Diana of Aricia with the Tauric <figure id="fig.00505">
<head orig="Diana.">Diana.</head>
</figure> Artemis, and a fable arose that Orestes had brought the image of that goddess into the grove. Diana was chiefly worshipped by women, who prayed to her for happiness in marriage or childbirth. The most important temple of Diana at Rome was on the Aventine, founded by Servius Tullius as the sanctuary of the Latin confederacy. On the day of its foundation (August 13) the slaves had a holiday. This Diana was completely identified with the sister of Apollo, and worshipped simply as Artemis at the Secular Games. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossludi">Ludi</ref>.) A sign of the original difference, however, remained. Cows were offered to the Diana of the Aventine, and her temple adorned with cows', not with stags', horns, but it was the doe which was sacred to Artemis.

<head orig="Diapsephĭsis">Diapsephisis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign>). A political institution at Athens, the object of which was to prevent aliens, or such as were the offspring of an unlawful marriage, from assuming the rights of citizens. As usurpations of this kind were not uncommon at Athens ( <title>Pericl.</title> 37), various measures had been adopted against them; but, as none of them had the desired effect, a new method, the <foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign>, was devised, according to which the trial of spurious citizens was to be held by the demotae within whose deme intruders (<foreign lang="greek">παρέγγραπτοι</foreign>) were suspected to exist; for if each deme separately was kept clear of intruders, the whole body of citizens would naturally feel the benefit. Every deme, therefore, obtained the right or duty at certain times to revise its lexiarchic registers, and to ascertain whether any had entered their names who had no claims to the rights of citizens. The assembly of the demotae, in which these investigations took place, was held under the presidency of the demarch or some senator belonging to the deme. When the demotae were assembled, an oath was administered to them, in which they promised to judge impartially. The president then read out <cb /> the names of the demotae from the register, asking the opinion of the assembly (<foreign lang="greek">διαψηφίζεσθαι</foreign>) respecting each individual, whether they thought him a true and legitimate citizen or not. Any one then had the right to say what he thought or knew of the person in question, and when any one was impeached a regular trial took place (Demosth. <title>c. Eubul.</title> p. 1301. 9). If a person was found guilty of having usurped the rights of a citizen (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποψηφίζεσθαι</foreign>), his name was struck from the lexiarchic register, and he himself was degraded to the rank of an alien. But if he did not acquiesce in the verdict, but appealed to the great courts of justice at Athens, a heavier punishment awaited him if he was found guilty there also; for he was then sold as a slave, and his property was confiscated by the State (Dion. Hal. <title>De Isaeo</title>, c. 16, and the fragment of the speech <title>pro Euphileto</title> there preserved).</p>
 <p>If by any accident the lexiarchic registers had been lost or destroyed, a careful scrutiny of the same nature as that described above, and likewise called <foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign>, took place, in order to prevent any spurious citizen from having his name entered in the new registers. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemus">Demus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The oldest known <foreign lang="greek">διαψήφισις</foreign> occurred in B.C. 445 ( <title>Pericl.</title> 37; Schol. Aristoph.  <title>Vesp.</title>l. c.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δικαίαρχος</foreign>). (1) A native of Messana in Sicily. He was a scholar of Aristotle's, and is called a Peripatetic philosopher by Cicero (<title>De Off.</title> ii. 5); but, though he wrote some works on philosophical subjects, he seems to have devoted his attention principally to geography and statistics. His chief philosophical work was two dialogues on the soul, each divided into three books, one dialogue (<foreign lang="greek">Κορινθιακοί</foreign>) being supposed to have been held at Corinth, the other at Mitylené (<foreign lang="greek">Λεσβιακοί</foreign>). 
<pb n="506" /><cb /> In these he argued against the existence of the soul. The greatest performance, however, of Dicaearchus was a treatise on the geography, politics, and manners of Greece, which he called <foreign lang="greek">Βίος Ἑλλάδος</foreign>, “The Life of Greece,” a title imitated by Varro in his <title>Vita Populi Romani.</title> All the philosophical writings of Dicaearchus are lost. His geographical works have shared the same fate, except a few fragments. We have remaining one hundred and fifty verses of his <foreign lang="greek">Ἀναγραφὴ τῆς Ἑλλάδος</foreign>, or “Description of Greece,” written in iambic trimeters; and also two fragments of the <foreign lang="greek">Βίος Ἑλλάδος</foreign>, one containing a description of Boeotia and Attica, and another an account of Mount Pelion. Dicaearchus's maps were extant in the time of Cicero (<title>Ep. ad Att.</title> vi. 2). Cicero was very fond of the writings of Dicaearchus, and speaks of him in terms of warm admiration (<title>Ad Att.</title> ii. 2). In one of the extant fragments Dicaearchus quotes Posidippus, and must therefore have been alive in B.C. 289.

<div2 id="crossdicasterion" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dicasterion">Dicasterion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δικαστήριον</foreign>). A word which indicates both the aggregate judges that sat in court and the place itself in which they held their sittings. For an account of the former, the reader is referred to the article <ref type="cross" target="crossdicastes">Dicastes;</ref> with respect to the latter, our information is very imperfect. In the earlier ages there were five celebrated places at Athens set apart for the sittings of the judges who had cognizance of the graver causes in which the loss of human life was avenged or expiated— viz., the Areopagites and the Ephetae. These places were on the Areopagus; in the Palladium, a sacred place in the southeastern part of the city; in the Delphinium, a place sacred to the Delphian Apollo in the same district; in the Prytaneum, the ancient sacred hearth of the State, to the northeast of the Acropolis; and finally at Phreatto or Phreattys in the Piraeus, at the inlet of Zea (Schömann, <title>Antiq.</title> i. 465, Eng. trans.; and the great passage in Demosth. <title>c. Aristocr.</title> pp. 641-646). The antiquity of these last four is sufficiently vouched for by the archaic character of the division of the causes that were appropriated to each: in the first we are told that accidental deaths were discussed, in the second, homicides confessed, but justified; in the third there were quasi-trials of inanimate things, which, by falling and the like, had occasioned a loss of human life (see <ref type="cross" target="crossapsychon-dike">Apsychon Diké</ref>); in the fourth, homicides who had returned from exile and committed a fresh manslaughter were appointed to be tried. With respect to these ancient institutions, of which little more than the name remained when the historical age commenced, it will be sufficient to observe that in accordance with the ancient Greek feeling respecting homicide—viz. that it involved ceremonial pollution in all cases, irrespective of the degree of criminality— the presiding judge was invariably the king archon, the Athenian <seg lang="la">rex sacrorum;</seg> and that the places in which the trials were held were open to the sky, to avoid the contamination which the judges might incur by being under the same roof with a murderer ( <title>de Caed. Her.</title> 11; cf. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phonou Diké</hi>).</p>
 <p>The Heliaea properly so called, and probably, also, the majority of the Heliastic courts, were situated in the Agora; others in various parts of the city. The statement that there were not more than ten of these is probably erroneous. Besides <cb /> the Heliaea, the first in numbers and importance, the following are named: the Parabyston (<foreign lang="greek">παράβυστον</foreign>), in which the Eleven presided, and which is said to have received its name from its position in a remote quarter of the city; the Dicasterion of Metiochus, or Metichus, and that of Calleas (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ Κάλλειον</foreign>), probably named after their builders; the Green Court (<foreign lang="greek">Βατραχιοῦν</foreign>) and the Red Court (<foreign lang="greek">Φοινικιοῦν</foreign>), the Middle Court (<foreign lang="greek">Μέσον</foreign>), the Greater Court (<foreign lang="greek">Μεῖζον</foreign>), the New Court (<foreign lang="greek">Καινόν</foreign>), the Triangular Court (<foreign lang="greek">Τρίγωνον</foreign>), and the Dicasterion at the holy place of Lycus (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ Λύκῳ</foreign>), probably near the Lyceum without the city. Dicasteries near the walls and in the street of the Hermoglyphi are mentioned with no further indication of their name. The Odeum, too, a building erected by Pericles and properly destined for musical performances, was used for the sittings of Heliastic courts; and so, probably, were other places of which no mention is found. The dicasts sat upon wooden benches, which were covered with rugs or matting (<foreign lang="greek">ψιαθία</foreign>), and there were elevations or tribunes (<foreign lang="greek">βήματα</foreign>), upon which the antagonist advocates stood during their address to the court. The space occupied by the persons engaged in the trial was protected by a railing (<foreign lang="greek">δρύφακτοι</foreign>) from the intrusion of the bystanders; but in causes which bore upon the violation of the Mysteries, a further space of fifty feet all round was enclosed by a rope, and the security of this barrier guaranteed by the presence of the public slaves.

<div2 id="crossdicastes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dicastes">Dicastes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δικαστής</foreign>). In its broadest acceptation a judge, but more particularly denoting the Athenian functionary of the democratic period, commonly rendered “juryman.” Except, however, in the circumstance that they were sworn “well and truly” to discharge the duties intrusted to them, there was little resemblance between an Attic dicasterion and an English jury. As distinguished from the district judges (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ κατὰ δήμους δικασται</foreign>, better known by their later name of <foreign lang="greek">οἱ τετταράκοντα</foreign>), and from the Nautodicae or judges in commercial cases, the dicastae are frequently styled Heliastae, and their courts the Helíastic courts. The name comes from <foreign lang="greek">ἡλιαία</foreign>, a word which, like <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>, denotes both the assembly and the place in which it was held; and the court of the Heliaea, as the most strongly manned and the first in dignity, being taken as a representative of the rest, both names were used indiscriminately. Their jurisdiction extended to matters of every kind without exception. In private causes it is highly probable that they acted originally as judges of the second instance—i. e. of appeal; but in public matters they acted as the primary and sole judicial authority. The Heliastae were instituted by Solon, but what was their original number and how they were nominated at first we do not know. At the time when democracy was fully developed, when the causes even of the subject allies were brought before the Athenian courts, there were 6000 dicasts or Heliasts, 600 for each tribe, chosen by lot. Previously the number cannot have been very small; and divisions of the whole body into sections, such as we find afterwards, may without hesitation be assumed to have existed in the earlier times also. The ballot (<foreign lang="greek">κληροῦν, ἐπικληροῦν τὰ δικαστήρια</foreign>, Demosth. <title>c. Everg.</title> p. 1144. 17; sometimes also <foreign lang="greek">πληροῦν</foreign>, after the analogy of “manning” a ship, <title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 729. 92) was conducted annually by the nine archons; according 
<pb n="507" /><cb /> to some authorities their secretary (<foreign lang="greek">γραμματεύς</foreign>) made the tenth.</p>
 <p>The lots were drawn, and the persons chosen were sworn, in the earlier ages at a place called Ardettus, without the city, on the banks of the Ilissus; but in after-times at some other spot, of which we are not informed. The formula of the Heliastic oath, preserved in Demosthenes (<title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 746. 149-151), passed until lately as genuine, and was accepted as such by Schömann in his early writings (<title>Att. Process</title>, etc.) as well as by other recent scholars. The first hint that, like most of the documents embodied in the Demosthenic speeches, it was the patchwork of a late grammarian, seems to have been given by Schömann in his <bibl default="NO"><title>Antiquities</title> (1855)</bibl>; and the point was completely proved in a special dissertation by Westermann in 1859. The whole number of 6000 Heliasts was divided into ten sections of 500 each, so that 1000 remained over, in order, when necessary, to serve for the filling of vacancies in the sections. These sections, as well as the places of meeting, were called Dicasteria, and in each section members of all the tribes were mingled together. Each Heliast received, as a certificate of his appointment, a bronze tablet (<foreign lang="greek">πινάκιον, σύμβολον</foreign>) with his name and the number or letter of the section to which he belonged (from A to K). Three of these <foreign lang="greek">σύμβολα</foreign> have been found, inscribed as follows: <foreign lang="greek">Β. ΑΝΤΙΧΑΡΜΟΣ ΛΑΜΠ</foreign>[<foreign lang="greek">ΤΡΕΥΣ</foreign>], <foreign lang="greek">Δ. ΔΙΟΔΩΡΟΣ ΦΡΕΑ</foreign>[<foreign lang="greek">ΡΡΙΟΣ</foreign>], <foreign lang="greek">Ε. ΔΕΙΝΙΑΣ ΑΛΑΙΕΥΣ</foreign>; and bear besides representations of owls and Gorgon heads, and other devices symbolic of the Athenian people (Boeckh, <title>C. I. G.</title> nos. 207-209).</p>
 <p>As often as courts were to be held the Heliastae assembled in the Agora, and the courts in which each section had to sit for the day were there assigned by the Thesmothetae by lot. But it did not happen always, or in every suit, that whole sections sat; on the contrary, sometimes cases were tried only by parts of a section, sometimes by several sections combined, according to the importance of the issues. Provision, however, was made that the number should be always an uneven one, in order to avoid an equality of the votes; and if we find the number of 200 or 2000 dicasts mentioned, we are to assume that the round numbers only are given instead of 201 or 2001. For examples of the actual figures, we have in Demosthenes a court of 1001 dicasts taken from two sections (<foreign lang="greek">δικαστηρίοιν δυοῖν εἰς ἕνα καὶ χιλίους ἐψηφισμένων</foreign>, <title>c. Timocr.</title> p. 702. 9); and one of 1501 from three sections in <title>Lex Seguer.</title> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἡλιαία</foreign>. The usual number in the Heliaea appears to have been 501.</p>
 <p>For the trial of certain classes of cases Heliastae of a peculiar qualification were required; as, for instance, in the case of profaners of the Mysteries, when the initiated only were allowed to judge; and in that of military offenders, who were left to the justice of those only whose comrades they were, or should have been at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed. After this ballot on the day of the trial each member of the section received a staff with the colour and number of the court in which he had to sit; this might serve both as a ticket to procure admittance and also to distinguish him from any loiterer who might endeavour clandestinely to obtain a seat after business had begun. That the dicasts were not sworn afresh before every case seems certain— the oath originally taken at the annual election <cb /> sufficed. The legal age of the Heliastae was at least thirty, and of course the full franchise (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτιμία</foreign>) was another condition of eligibility. No perquisite was ever more jealously guarded. For an <hi rend="italic">atimos</hi> to attempt to earn the dicast's fee was a capital offence, and a case is mentioned in which this law was actually carried out (Demosth. <title>c. Mid.</title> p. 573. 182). It would appear that they were only balloted for from among those who voluntarily offered themselves; we have no information on this point, but after the custom of payment was introduced there would be no lack of candidates.</p>
 <p>This payment (<foreign lang="greek">μισθὸς δικαστικός</foreign>, more usually <foreign lang="greek">τὸ δικαστικόν</foreign>) is said to have been first instituted by Pericles. It is generally supposed from Aristophanes (<title>Nub.</title> 863), who makes Strepsiades say that with the first obolus he ever received as a dicast he bought a toy for his son, that it was at first only one obolus. It increased rapidly under the influence of the demagogues (Aristot. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Schol. Aristoph. <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 682" default="NO"> <title>Vesp.</title>682</bibl>; Schol. <title>Ran.</title> 140; <bibl n="Poll.  8. 113" default="NO">Poll.viii. 113</bibl>; Hesych. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">δικαστικόν</foreign>; Suid. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ἡλιασταί</foreign>). Three oboli or the <hi rend="italic">triobolon</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τριώβολον</foreign>) occurs as early as B.C. 425 in the comedies of Aristophanes, and is afterwards mentioned frequently ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 51" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eq.</title>51</bibl><bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 255" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. Eq., 255</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet.

The payment was made at the end of the day's work by the <ref type="cross" target="crosscolacretae">Colacretae</ref> (q.v.), in exchange for the staff (<foreign lang="greek">βακτηρία</foreign>) and ticket (<foreign lang="greek">σύμβολον</foreign>) with which, as we have seen, each dicast was already provided on entering the court (Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Plut.</title> 277; Suid. s. v. <foreign lang="greek">βακτηρία</foreign>; <bibl n="Poll.  8. 16" default="NO">Poll.viii. 16</bibl>). No doubt the staves only were given up, to be redistributed on another trial; the bronze <foreign lang="greek">σύμβολα</foreign> merely shown, and retained by the dicast, as they were inscribed with his name and had to serve him throughout the year; unless we are to suppose that two different kinds of <foreign lang="greek">σύμβολα</foreign> were used.

 observed that cases frequently arise which, with reference to the wrong complained of, may with equal propriety be brought before a court in the form of the <foreign lang="greek">γραφή</foreign> last mentioned, or in that of an ordinary <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign>; and under these circumstances the laws of Athens gave the prosecutor an ample choice of methods to vindicate his rights by private or public proceedings, much in the same way as a plaintiff in modern times may, for the same offence, prefer an indictment for assault or bring his civil action for trespass on the person. It will be necessary to mention some of the principal distinctions in the treatment of causes of the two great classes above mentioned before proceeding to discuss the forms and treatment of the private lawsuit.</p>
 <p>In a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign>, only the person whose rights were alleged to be affected, or the legal protector (<foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>) of such person, if a minor or otherwise incapable of appearing <seg lang="la">suo iure</seg>, was permitted to institute an action as plaintiff; in public causes, with the exception of some few in which the person injured or his family were peculiarly bound and interested to act, any free citizen, and sometimes, when the State was directly attacked, almost any alien, was empowered to do so. In all private causes, except those of <foreign lang="greek">ἐξούλης, βιαίων</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἐξαιρέσεως</foreign>, the penalty or other subject of contention was exclusively recovered by the plaintiff; while in most others the State alone, or jointly with the prosecutor, profited by the pecuniary punishment of the offender. The court fees, called <foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖα</foreign>, were paid in private but not in public causes; and a public prosecutor who compromised the action with the defendant was in most cases punished by a fine of a thousand drachmas and a modified disfranchisement, while there was no legal impediment at any period of a private lawsuit to the reconciliation of the litigant parties (Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 163).</p>
 <p>The proceedings in the <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign> were commenced by a summons to the defendant (<foreign lang="greek">πρόσκλησις</foreign>) to appear on a certain day before the proper magistrate (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγωγεύς</foreign>), and there answer the charges preferred against him ( <bibl default="NO"><title>Nub.</title> 1221</bibl>). This summons was often served by the plaintiff in person, accompanied by one or two witnesses (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscleteres">Cleteres</ref>), whose names were endorsed upon the declaration (<foreign lang="greek">λῆξις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἔγκλημα</foreign>). If there were an insufficient service of the summons, the lawsuit was styled <foreign lang="greek">ἀπρόσκλητος</foreign> and dismissed by the magistrate (Hesych.). From the circumstance of the same officer who conducted the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign> being also necessarily present at the trial, and as there were besides <seg lang="la">dies nefasti</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποφράδες</foreign>) and festivals during which none, or only some special causes could be commenced, the power of the plaintiff in selecting his time was, of course, in some degree limited; and of several causes, we know that the time for their institution was particularized by law ( <bibl default="NO"><title>Nub.</title> 1190</bibl>). There were also occasions upon which a personal arrest of the party proceeded against took the place of, or at all events was simultaneous with, the service of the summons; as, for instance, when the plaintiff doubted whether such party would not leave the country to avoid answering the action; and accordingly we find that in such cases (Demosth. <title>c. Zenoth.</title> p. 890. 29; <title>c. Aristog.</title> i. p. 788. 60) an Athenian plaintiff might compel a foreigner to accompany him to the polemarch's office, <cb /> and there produce bail for his appearance, or, failing to do so, submit to remain in custody till the trial. The word <foreign lang="greek">κατεγγυᾶν</foreign> is peculiarly used of this proceeding. Between the service of the summons and appearance of the parties before the magistrate, it is very probable that the law prescribed the intervention of a period of five days (Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 580). If both parties appeared, the proceedings commenced by the plaintiff putting in his declaration, and at the same time depositing his share of the court fees (<foreign lang="greek">πρυτανεῖα</foreign>), the non-payment of which was a fatal objection to the further progress of a cause (Matthiae, <title>de Iud. Ath.</title> p. 261). These were very trifling in amount. If the subject of litigation was rated at less than 100 drachmae, nothing was paid; if at more than 100 drachmae and less than 1000 drachmae, 3 drachmae was a sufficient deposit, and so on in proportion. The deposits being made, it became the duty of the magistrate, if no manifest objection appeared on the face of the declaration, to cause it to be written out on a tablet, and exposed for the inspection of the public on the wall or other place that served as the cause list of his court (Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 605).</p>
 <p>The magistrate then appointed a day for the further proceedings of the <ref type="cross" target="crossanacrisis">anacrisis</ref> (q.v.), which was done by drawing lots for the priority in case there was a plurality of causes instituted at the same time; and to this proceeding the phrase <foreign lang="greek">λαγχάνειν δίκην</foreign>, which generally denotes to bring an action, is to be primarily attributed. If the plaintiff failed to appear at the anacrisis, the suit, of course, fell to the ground; if the defendant made default, judgment passed against him (Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 623). Both parties, however, received an official summons before their nonappearance was made the ground of either result. An affidavit might at this, as well as at other periods of the action, be made in behalf of a person unable to attend upon the given day, and this would, if allowed, have the effect of postponing further proceedings (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπωμοσία</foreign>); it might, however, be combated by a counter-affidavit to the effect that the alleged reason was unfounded or otherwise insufficient (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνθυπωμοσία</foreign>); and a question would arise upon this point, the decision of which, when adverse to the defendant, would render him liable to the penalty of contumacy (Demosth. <title>c. Olymp.</title> p. 1174. 25). The plaintiff was in this case said <foreign lang="greek">ἐρήμην ἑλεῖν</foreign>; the defendant, <foreign lang="greek">ἐρήμην ὀφλεῖν, δίκην</foreign> being the word omitted in both phrases. If the cause were primarily brought before an umpire (<foreign lang="greek">διαιτητής</foreign>), the anacrisis was conducted by him; in cases of appeal it was dispensed with as unnecessary. The anacrisis began with the affidavit of the plaintiff (<foreign lang="greek">προωμοσία</foreign>), then followed the answer of the defendant (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντωμοσία</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιγραφή</foreign>) (see <ref type="cross" target="crossantigraphe">Antigraphé</ref>), then the parties produced their respective witnesses, and reduced their evidence to writing, and put in originals, or authenticated copies, of all the records, deeds, and contracts that might be useful in establishing their case, as well as memoranda of offers and requisitions then made by either side (<foreign lang="greek">προκλήσεις</foreign>). The whole of the documents were then, if the cause took a straightforward course (<foreign lang="greek">εὐθυδικία</foreign>), enclosed on the last day of the anacrisis in a casket (<foreign lang="greek">ἐχῖνος</foreign>), which was sealed and intrusted to the custody of the presiding magistrate till it was produced and opened at the trial. During the interval 
<pb n="509" /><cb /> no alteration in its contents was permitted, and accordingly evidence that had been discovered after the anacrisis was not producible at the trial (Demosth. <title>c. Boeot.</title> i. p. 999. 18). In some causes, the trial before the dicasts was by law appointed to come on within a given time; in such as were not provided for by such regulations, we may suppose that it would principally depend upon the leisure of the magistrate. The parties, however, might defer the day (<foreign lang="greek">κυρία</foreign>) by mutual consent (Demosth. <title>c. Phaen.</title> p. 1042. 12). Upon the court being assembled the magistrate called on the cause (Platner, <title>Process und Klagen</title>, i. 182), and the plaintiff opened his case. At the commencement of the speech the proper officer (<foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐφ ὕδωρ</foreign>) filled the clepsydra with water. As long as the water flowed from this vessel the orator was permitted to speak; if, however, evidence was to be read by the officer of the court or a law recited the water was stopped till the speaker recommenced. The quantity of water, or, in other words, the length of the speeches, was not by any means the same in all causes: in the speech against Macartatus, and elsewhere, one amphora only was deemed sufficient; eleven are mentioned in the impeachment of Aeschines for misconduct in his embassy. In some few cases, as those of <foreign lang="greek">κάκωσις</foreign>, according to Harpocration, no limit was prescribed. The speeches were sometimes interrupted by the cry <foreign lang="greek">κατάβα</foreign>, “go down”—in effect, “cease speaking”—from the dicasts, which placed the advocate in a serious dilemma; for if after this he still persisted in his address, he could hardly fail to offend those who bade him stop; if he obeyed the order, it might be found, after the votes had been taken, that it had emanated from a minority of the dicasts ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 980" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>980</bibl>). After the speeches of the advocates, which were in general two on each side, and the incidental reading of the documentary and other evidence, the dicasts proceeded to give their judgment by ballot. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspsephus">Psephos</ref>.</p>
 <p>When the principal point at issue was decided in favour of the plaintiff, there followed, in the case of a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη τιμητή</foreign>, a further discussion as to the amount of damages, or penalty, which the defendant should pay. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstimema">Timema</ref>.) If the penalty was already prescribed by law, the suit was described as <foreign lang="greek">ἀτίμητος</foreign>, not requiring assessment (Demosth. <title>c. Mid.</title> p. 543. 90). The method of voting upon this question seems to have varied, in that the dicasts used a small tablet instead of a ballot-ball, upon which those that approved of the heavier penalty drew a long line, the others a short one ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 167" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>167</bibl>). Upon judgment being given in a private suit, the Athenian law left its execution very much in the hands of the successful party, who was empowered to seize the movables of his antagonist as a pledge for the payment of the money or institute an action of ejectment (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξούλης</foreign>) against the refractory debtor. The judgment of a court of dicasts was in general decisive (<foreign lang="greek">δίκη αὐτοτελής</foreign>); but upon certain occasions, as, for instance, when a gross case of perjury or conspiracy could be proved by the unsuccessful party to have operated to his disadvantage, the cause, upon the conviction of such conspirators or witnesses, might be commenced <seg lang="la">de novo.</seg> In addition to which, the party against whom judgment has passed by default had the power to revive the cause, upon proving that his non-appearance in <cb /> court was unavoidable (Platner, <title>Process und Klagen</title>, i. 396); this, however, was to be exercised within two months after the original judgment. If the parties were willing to refer the matter to an umpire (<foreign lang="greek">διαιτητής</foreign>), it was in the power of the magistrate to transfer the proceedings as they stood to that officer; and in the same way, if the diaetetes considered the matter in hand too high for him, he might refer it to the <foreign lang="greek">εἰσαγωγεύς</foreign>, to be brought by him before an Heliastic court. The whole of the proceedings before the diaetetes were analogous to those before the dicasts, and bore equally the name of <foreign lang="greek">δίκη</foreign>; but it seems that the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ἀντιλαχεῖν τὴν μὴ οὖσαν</foreign> is peculiarly applied to the revival of a cause before the umpire in which judgment had passed by default.</p>

<head orig="Dictātor">Dictator</head>

 <p> The Latin term for a magistrate appointed for special emergencies, after auspices duly taken by the consuls on the commission of the Senate. The dictator was never appointed for more than six months. The first instance of the appointment occurred in B.C. 501. The dictator was usually, though not always, chosen from the number of <seg lang="la">consulares</seg>, or men who had held the office of consul. No plebeian was elected before B.C. 356. He was always nominated for a particular or specified purpose, on the fulfilment of which he laid down his office. He combined the supreme judicial with the supreme military power, and there was, originally, no appeal against his proceedings, even the veto of the tribunes being powerless against him. He was free from responsibility for his acts, and could therefore not be called to account on the expiration of his term of office, the case of Camillus, who was so impeached, being very peculiar. (See Becker, <title>Röm. Alterth.</title> ii. pt. 2, p. 172.) That the dictator was free from subsequent 
<pb n="510" /><cb />
 attack is expressly stated by Dion. Hal. (v. 70, vii. 56), Appian (<title>B. C.</title> ii. 23), and others. His insignia were the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg> and the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, and he was attended by twenty-four lictors, who represented the lictors of two consuls, and who even in the city bore axes in their bundles of rods, as a sign of unlimited power of life and death. His assistant was the <seg lang="la">magister equitum</seg> (master of the horse), who was bound absolutely to obey his commands, and whom he had to nominate immediately after his own election. The original function of the dictator was military; but after B.C. 363 a dictator was occasionally chosen, in the absence of the consuls, for other purposes than dealing with external danger or internal troubles—especially to hold the games or religious festivities. The office gradually passed out of use, though not legally abolished. The last military dictator was appointed in B.C. 206, the last absolutely in B.C. 202. The dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar who was named perpetual dictator not long before his death, were antirepublican and unconstitutional. After Caesar had been murdered, in B.C. 44, the office was abolished forever by a law of Marcus Antonius. See Mommsen, <title>Römische Staatsrecht</title>, ii. 133-172; Becker, <title>Röm. Alterth.</title> ii. pt. 2, p. 150 foll.

A Cretan, said to have accompanied Idomeneus to the Trojan War, and to have written a history of that contest. This work (<title>Ephemeris Belli Troiani</title>), according to the account that has come down to us, was discovered in the reign of Nero, in a tomb near Cnossus, which was laid open by an earthquake.

<head orig="Dido">Dido</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διδώ</foreign>), also called <ref type="cross" target="crosselissa">Elissa</ref>, the reputed founder of Carthage. She was a daughter of a Tyrian king, Belus, Agenor, or Mutgo, and sister of Pygmalion, who succeeded to the crown after the death of his father. Dido was married to her wealthy uncle, Acerbas or Sichaeus, who was murdered by Pygmalion. Upon this, Dido secretly sailed from Tyre with his treasures, accompanied by some noble Tyrians, and passed over to Africa. Here she purchased as much land as might be enclosed with the hide of a bull, but she ordered the hide to be cut up into the thinnest possible strips, and with them she surrounded a spot on which she built a citadel called Byrsa (from <foreign lang="greek">βύρσα</foreign>, “bull's-hide”). Around this fort the city of Carthage arose and soon became a powerful and flourishing place. The neighbouring king, Hiarbas, jealous of the prosperity of the new city, demanded the hand of Dido in marriage, threatening Carthage with war in case of refusal. Dido had vowed eternal fidelity to her late husband; but seeing that the Carthaginians expected her to comply with the demands of Hiarbas, she pretended to yield to their wishes, and under pretence of soothing the manes of Acerbas by expiatory sacrifices she erected a funeral pile, on which she stabbed herself in presence of her people. After her death she was worshipped by the Carthaginians as a divinity. Vergil has inserted in his <title>Aeneid</title> the legend of Dido, with various modifications. According to the common chronology, there was an interval of more than 
<pb n="511" /><cb /> 300 years between the capture of Troy <bibl default="NO">(B.C. 1184)</bibl> and the foundation of Carthage (B.C. 853); but Vergil, nevertheless, makes Dido a contemporary of Aeneas, with whom she falls in love on his arrival in Africa. When Aeneas hastened to seek the new home which the gods had promised him, Dido, in despair, destroyed herself on a funeral pile. She was worshipped at Carthage and may be identified with Iuno Caelestis, the Roman representative of the Phoenician Astarté.

<head orig="Didymus">Didymus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δίδυμος</foreign>). A famous grammarian, the son of a seller of fish at Alexandria, who was born in the consulship of Antonius and Cicero, B.C. 63, and flourished in the reign of Augustus. Macrobius calls him the greatest grammarian of his own or any other time (<title>Saturn.</title> v. 18, 9). According to Athenaeus (iv. 139), he published 3500 volumes, and had written so much that he was called “the forgetter of books” (<foreign lang="greek">βιβλιολάθας</foreign>), for he often himself forgot what he had written; and also “the man with brazen bowels” (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκέντερος</foreign>), from his unwearied industry. He wrote, among other things, commentaries on Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, Bacchylides, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Cratinus, Eupolis, Aristophanes, Menander, Antiphon, Isaeus , Hyperides, Aeschines, Demosthenes, and Thucydides; on Ion; and also on the plays of Phrynichus; several treatises against Iuba, king of Mauretania; a book on the corruption of style; and a great number of historical and antiquarian treatises. The most important production of Didymus was his very learned treatise on the edition of Homer by <ref type="cross" target="crossaristarchus">Aristarchus</ref> (q.v.), parts of which are preserved in the Venetian scholia on Homer. His lexical works, in fact, were the source of innumerable lexica, scholia, etc. The collection of proverbs extant under the name of Zenobius was partly taken from a previous collection made by Didymus. The fragments of Didymus may be found in the collection by M. Schmidt <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1854)</bibl>. See the account of Didymus in Wilamowitz, Eurip. <title>Heracles</title>, i. 157-168; and Susemihl, <title>Geschichte d. griech. Lit.</title> ii. 195-210, 688 foll. <bibl default="NO">(1892)</bibl>.

<head orig="Dies">Dies</head>

 <p> The ancients distinguished (1) <seg lang="la">dies civilis</seg> <cb /> (<foreign lang="greek">νυχθήμερον</foreign>), the time in which the sun apparently completed a course around the earth, including thus both night and day; and</p>
 <p>(2) <seg lang="la">dies naturalis</seg> or the time between the rising and the setting of the sun. The civil day began with the Athenians at the setting of the sun; with the Romans (as with the Egyptians and Hipparchus) at midnight; with the Babylonians at the rising of the sun, and with the Umbrians at mid-day (Macrob. <title>Saturn.</title> i. 3; <bibl n="Gel.  3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iii. 2</bibl>).</p>
 <p>At the time of the Homeric poems, the natural day was divided into three parts ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 21. 111" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxi. 111</bibl>). The first, called <foreign lang="greek">ἠώς</foreign>, began with sunrise and comprehended the whole space of time during which light seemed to be increasing—i. e. till mid-day ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8. 66" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>viii. 66</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 84" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., ix. 84</bibl>; <bibl n="Homer Od. 9. 56" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>ix. 56</bibl>). The second part was called <foreign lang="greek">μέσον ἦμαρ</foreign> or mid-day, during which the sun was thought to stand still (Hermias, <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Phaedr.</title> p. 342). The third part bore the name of <foreign lang="greek">δείλη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δείελον ἦμαρ</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 17. 606" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xvii. 606</bibl>; cf. Buttman's <title>Lexilog.</title> ii. n. 95), which derived its name from the increased warmth of the atmosphere. The last part of the <foreign lang="greek">δείλη</foreign> was sometimes designated by the words <foreign lang="greek">ποτὶ ἕσπερα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">βουλυτός</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 17. 191" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xvii. 191</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16. 779" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xvi. 779</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The first and last of the divisions made at the time of Homer were afterwards subdivided into two parts. The earlier part of the morning was termed <foreign lang="greek">πρωΐ</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πρῲ τῆς ἡμέρας</foreign>; the later—i. e. from 9 or 10 till noon—<foreign lang="greek">πληθούσης τῆς ἀγορᾶς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">περὶ πλήθουσαν ἀγορὰν</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">μέσον ἦμαρ</foreign> of Homer was afterwards expressed by <foreign lang="greek">μεσημβρία, μέσον ἡμέρας</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">μέση ἡμέρα</foreign>, and comprehended, as before, the middle of the day, when the sun seemed neither to rise nor to decline. The two parts of the afternoon were called <foreign lang="greek">δείλη πρωΐη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">πρωΐα</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">δείλη ὀψίη</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὀψία</foreign>. This division continued to be observed down to the latest period of Grecian history, though another more accurate division, and one more adapted to the purposes of common life, was introduced at an early period; for Anaximander, or according to others, Anaximenes, is said to have made the Greeks acquainted with the use of the Babylonian chronometer or sundial (called <foreign lang="greek">πόλος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὡρολόγιον</foreign>, sometimes with the epithet <foreign lang="greek">σκιοθηρικόν</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἡλιαμάνδρον</foreign>), by means of which the natural day was divided into twelve equal spaces of time. These spaces were, of course, longer or shorter according to the various seasons of the year. The name hours (<foreign lang="greek">ὧραι</foreign>), however, did not come into general use till a very late period, and the difference between natural and equinoctial hours was first observed by the Alexandrian astronomers. See Pollux, <bibl n="Ruf. Onom. 1. 68." default="NO"> <title>Onom.</title>i. 68.</bibl></p>
 <p>During the early ages of the history of Rome, the natural phenomena of increasing light and darkness formed with the Romans, as with the Greeks, the standard of division, as we see from the vague expressions in Censorinus (<title>De Die Nat.</title> 24). In the Twelve Tables only the rising and the setting of the sun and mid-day (<seg lang="la">meridies</seg>) were mentioned as the parts into which the day was then divided. Varro (<title>L. L.</title> vi. 4, 5) and Isidorus ( <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 5. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>v. 30</bibl> and 31) likewise distinguished three parts of the day—viz. <seg lang="la">mane, meridies</seg>, and <seg lang="la">suprema</seg>, sc. <seg lang="la">tempestas</seg>, after which no assembly could be held in the Forum.</p>
 <p>But the division of the day most generally observed by the Romans was that into <seg lang="la">tempus antemeridianum</seg> and <seg lang="la">pomeridianum</seg>, the <seg lang="la">meridies</seg> itself being considered only as a point at which the one 
<pb n="512" /><cb />
 ended and the other commenced. As it was of importance that this moment should be known, an officer (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaccensi">Accensi</ref>) of the consuls was directed to proclaim the time of mid-day, when from the Curia he saw the sun standing between the Rostra and the Graecostasis. The division of the day into twelve equal spaces, which, here as in Greece, were shorter in winter than in summer, was adopted at the time when artificial means of measuring time were introduced among the Romans from Greece. This was about the year B.C. 293, when L. Papirius Cursor, before the war with Pyrrhus, brought to Rome an instrument called <seg lang="la">solarium horologium</seg>, or simply <seg lang="la">solarium</seg> (Plaut. <title>ap. Gellium</title>, iii. 3. 5;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.  212" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>vii. 212</bibl>). In B.C. 263, M. Valerius Messala brought one which he had taken at the capture of Catina; and although this was incorrect, having been constructed for a place 4° farther south than Rome, it was in use for 99 years before the error was discovered. In B.C. 164, the censor Q. Marcius Philippus had a more exact sundial constructed; but the time was still unknown in cloudy weather. Scipio Nasica, therefore, erected in B.C. 159 a public clepsydra, which indicated the hours of the night as well as of the day (Censor. c. 23). Before the erection of a clepsydra it was customary for one of the subordinate officers of the praetor to proclaim the third, sixth, and ninth hours; which shows that the day was, like the night, divided into four parts, each consisting of three hours. In daily life numerous terms were in use to denote the different parts of the day, mostly of a general and somewhat vague character. (Cf. Varr. <title>L. L.</title> vi. 4-7; Servius on <bibl n="Verg. A. 2. 268" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>ii. 268</bibl>; iii. 587;  <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 5. 31" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>v. 31</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 32." default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 32.</bibl>) See, also, the article <ref type="cross" target="crosshorologium">Horologium</ref>.</p>
 <p>All the days of the year were, according to different points of view, divided by the Romans into different classes. For the purpose of the administration of justice and of holding assemblies of the people all the days were divided into <seg lang="la">dies fasti, dies nefasti</seg>, and <seg lang="la">dies</seg> partly <seg lang="la">fasti</seg>, partly <seg lang="la">nefasti.</seg></p>
 <p>1. <title>Dies fasti</title>, in the wider sense, were days on which legal and political business could be lawfully transacted. They were divided into:</p>
 <p><title>(a) Dies fasti</title>, in the narrower sense, marked with F in the calendars. On these legal business could be conducted (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 48" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 48</bibl>, <seg lang="la">fastus erit per quem lege licebit agi;</seg> Varr. <title>L. L.</title> vi 29, <seg lang="la">dies fasti per quos praetoribus omnia verba sine piaculo licet fari</seg>). The word is derived by the ancients from <seg lang="la">fari;</seg> but, although the root is undoubtedly the same, the more immediate connection is with <seg lang="la">fas.</seg></p>
 <p><title>(b) Dies comitiales</title>, days on which meetings of the people could legally be held, and on which, if there was no meeting convened, courts could be opened (Macrob. <title>Saturn.</title> i. 16).</p>
 <p>These days are marked C in the calendar.</p>
 <p>2. <title>Dies nefasti</title> were days on which no legal or political business could be done (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> vi. 30). These are again divided into two quite distinct classes:</p>
 <p><title>(a) Dies nefasti</title> or <seg lang="la">feriati</seg>, on which no business could be done because the day was sacred to some festival. These are marked NP in the calendars. This sign was commonly interpreted <seg lang="la">nefastus parte</seg> or <seg lang="la">nefastus principio</seg>, and was explained to mean that the day was one during the earlier part of which no business could be done. But Mommsen (<title>Chronol.</title> p. 220; <title>C. I. L.</title> i. 366) showed that this view was quite untenable, and explains the sign to be, like M' when used as an abbreviation for <cb /> Manius, a modification of the archaic M with five strokes (MV).</p>
 <p><title>(b) Dies religiosi</title> or <seg lang="la">vitiosi</seg>, sometimes called <seg lang="la">atri</seg>, marked in the calendars by R. These were unlucky days, which had been declared to be such by a decree of the Senate in consequence of some disaster which had taken place upon them. All the <seg lang="la">dies postriduani</seg> were included under this head —i. e. the days after the Kalends, the Nones, and the Ides—because these were believed to have been especially unfortunate (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 59" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 59, 60</bibl>). On these days it was not only unlawful to transact any legal or political business, but it was also unlucky to begin any affair of importance. Cf. Gell. iv.9.5.</p>
 <p>3. Days partly <seg lang="la">fasti</seg> and partly not, including:</p>
 <p><title>(a) Dies intercisi</title>, marked in the calendars by EN, for <hi rend="italic">endotercisi</hi> (<hi rend="italic">endo-</hi> being an archaic form of <seg lang="la">in</seg>, as in <hi rend="italic">endoperator</hi>). On these days a victim was sacrificed in the morning and the <seg lang="la">exta</seg> offered in the evening. Between the sacrifice and the offering the day was <seg lang="la">fastus;</seg> before the former and after the latter it was <seg lang="la">nefastus</seg> (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> vi. 31; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 49" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 49</bibl>).</p>
 <p><title>(b) Dies fissi</title>, three in number. To two of these, March 24 and May 24, are prefixed the letters Q. R. C. F.—i. e. <seg lang="la">quando rex (sacrorum) comitiavit, fas.</seg> These days were, even in ancient times, confused with the <title>Regifugium</title>—i. e. February 24— and the letters were wrongly interpreted <seg lang="la">quando rex comitio fugit.</seg> To the third, June 15, is prefixed Q. ST. D. F.—i. e. <seg lang="la">quando stercus delatum fas;</seg> on this day the temple of Vesta was solemnly cleansed by the Vestals, and the filth carried away or thrown into the Tiber (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 707" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 707</bibl>), no other business being permitted on this day.</p>
 <p>Mommsen (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. p. 373) calculates that the year contained 45 <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg>, 194 <seg lang="la">dies comitiales</seg>, 48 <seg lang="la">dies nefasti</seg> or <seg lang="la">feriati</seg>, 57 <seg lang="la">dies religiosi</seg>, 8 <seg lang="la">dies intercisi</seg>, and 3 <seg lang="la">dies fissi.</seg></p>
 <p>Another division of the days of the year was of a purely religious character, with which naturally the former division to a certain extent coincided in a city so dominated by religious scruples as Rome:</p>
 <p>1. <title>Dies festi</title>, on which the gods were honoured by (a) <seg lang="la">sacrificia</seg>, (b) <seg lang="la">epulae</seg>, (c) <seg lang="la">ludi</seg>, (d) <seg lang="la">feriae.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossferiae">Feriae</ref>.</p>
 <p>2. <title>Dies profesti</title>, ordinary working-days.</p>
 <p>3. <title>Dies intercisi</title>, of a mixed character.</p>

<div2 id="crossdigamma" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Digamma">Digamma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δίγαμμα</foreign>). A name given by grammarians of the first century to Vau, the sixth letter of the early Greek alphabet, but which in the classical had ceased to be used and was known only by inscriptions. The digamma (“double gamma”) gets its name from its form <figure /> or <foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign>. Its sound was originally something like that of English <title>W.</title> Its form in the hieratic Egyptian was <figure />; in the ancient Phoenician, <figure />; the square Hebrew, <figure />. It is found in Peloponnesian inscriptions as late as the sixth century B.C., but it had disappeared from the Ionic or Eastern Greek alphabet before the middle of the seventh century B.C., being retained only as a numeral=6. From the Chalcidian or Western alphabet it was transmitted to Italy, retaining 
<pb n="513" /><cb /> its position as the sixth letter, but acquiring the sound of <title>F</title>, a labio-dental fricative. See <ref type="cross" target="crossalphabet">Alphabet</ref>.</p>
 <p>That its influence remained after it ceased to be written, is shown by the fact that in the Homeric poems it prevents elision where a final vowel stands before a word which originally had the digamma (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">φίλα ϝείματα δύσω</foreign>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdialects">Dialects</ref>.) Too much was made of this fact at one time, and Mr. Payne Knight even published a text of Homer with the digamma restored, a part of this text being reprinted in this country by Dr. Charles Anthon in his edition of the <title>Iliad.</title> But more recent scholarship shows that many of the supposed instances are not those of words that originally were digammated, but which rather once had an initial spirant, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">j</hi>—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">εἰς ἅλα</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἆλτο</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">ἔτι γὰρ</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ς</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἔχον</foreign>. See Hadley's <title>Essays</title>, pp. 56-80 <bibl default="NO">(1873)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Words which finally lost the digamma in Greek still often show it in the cognate languages—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">οἶκος</foreign>, Lat. <seg lang="la">vicus;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">οἶνος</foreign>, Lat. <seg lang="la">vinum;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ὀΐς</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὀϝις</foreign>), Lat. <seg lang="la">ovis;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ῥήγυυμι</foreign>, Lat. <seg lang="la">frango;</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ἔργον</foreign>, Eng. work. In Laconian it frequently became <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>—e. g. <foreign lang="greek">βάννας</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ϝάναξ, βέργον</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ϝέργον</foreign>, etc.</p>
 <p>The word <foreign lang="greek">δίγαμμα</foreign> is not found earlier than the first century A.D., when it occurs in the grammarians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes it, but gives it no name (i. 20). Terentianus Maurus calls it <foreign lang="greek">δίγαμμος</foreign> <seg lang="la">littera</seg> (163 K). Macrobius uses the word <foreign lang="greek">δίγαμμον</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">στοιχεῖον</foreign>) (<title>De Vero.</title> vi. 13). Quintilian (i. 7, 27) calls it <title>Aeolica littera</title> (cf. i. 4, 7), but it is not found in the later Lesbian inscriptions, and in Alcaeus and Sappho it is represented by <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">ρ</foreign> (e. g. <foreign lang="greek">βράκος</foreign> for the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">ῥάκος</foreign>= <foreign lang="greek">ϝράκος</foreign>).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Διϊπόλια, Διϊπόλεια</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">Διπόλια</foreign>). A festival celebrated in Athens on the 14th Scirophorion (June to July) to Zeus ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 420" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 420</bibl>) as the protector of the city. It was also called Buphonia, from the sacrifice of an ox connected with it. A labouring ox was led to the altar of Zeus in the Acropolis, which was strewn with wheat and barley. As soon as the ox touched the consecrated grain he was punished by a blow on the neck from an axe, delivered by a priest of a particular family, who instantly threw away the axe and took to flight. In his absence the axe was brought to judgment in the Prytaneum, and condemned, as a thing polluted by murder, to be thrown into the sea. To kill a labouring ox, the trusty helper of man, was rigidly forbidden by custom. In the exceptional sacrifice of one at this festival the ancient custom may be regarded as on the one hand excusing the slaughter, and on the other insisting that it was, nevertheless, equivalent to a murder.

 <p> The levying of soldiers for military service among the Romans. In the republican age all the citizens who were liable to service <cb /> assembled in the Capitol on the day previously announced by the consuls in their <seg lang="la">edictum</seg>, or proclamation. The twenty-four <seg lang="la">tribuni militum</seg> were first divided among the four legions to be levied. Then one of the tribes was chosen by lot, and the presence of the citizens ascertained by calling the names according to the lists of the several tribes. The calling was always opened with names of good omen. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossomen">Omen</ref>.) If a man did not appear he would be punished, according to circumstances, by a fine, confiscation of property, corporal punishment, even by being sold into slavery. Four men of equal age and bodily capacity were ordered to come forward, and were distributed among the four legions; then another four, and so on, so that each legion got men of equal quality. As the proceeding was the same with the other tribes, each legion had a quarter of the levy for each tribe. No one man had exemption (<seg lang="la">vacatio</seg>) from service unless he was over forty-six years of age, or had served the number of campaigns prescribed by law—twenty in the infantry, ten in the cavalry—or held a city office or priesthood, or had a temporary or perpetual dispensation granted on account of special business of State. In ancient times the levy of the cavalry followed that of the infantry, in later times it preceded it. On the oath taken after the levy, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssacramentum">Sacramentum</ref>.</p>
 <p>About the year B.C. 100, Marius procured the admission of the <seg lang="la">capite censi</seg>, or classes without property, to military service. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossproletarii">Proletarii</ref>.) After this the legions were chiefly made up out of this class by enlistment; and though the liability to common military service still existed for all citizens, the wealthy citizens strove to relieve themselves of it, the more so as after Marius the time of service was extended from twenty campaigns to twenty years. In B.C. 89, Roman citizenship was extended to all the inhabitants of Italy, and all, therefore, became liable to service. The levies were, in consequence, not held exclusively in Rome, but in all Italy by <seg lang="la">conquisitores.</seg> These officials, though they continued to use the official lists of qualified persons, assumed more and more the character of recruiting officers. They were ready to grant the <seg lang="la">vacatio</seg>, or exemption, for money or favour, and anxious to get hold of volunteers by holding out promises. The legal liability to military service continued to exist in imperial times, but after the time of Augustus it was only enforced in regard to the garrison at Rome and on occasions of special necessity. The army had become a standing one, and even outside of Italy, except when a special levy of new legions was made, the vacancies caused by the departure of the soldiers who had served their time were filled up by volunteers. The levy was carried out by imperial commissioners (<hi rend="italic">dilectatores</hi>), whose business it was to test the qualifications of the recruits. These were, Roman citizenship—for only citizens were allowed to serve, whether in the legions or in the guard and other garrison cohorts of Rome (<seg lang="la">cohortes urbanae</seg>) —physical capacity, and a certain height, the average of which was 5 feet 10 inches under the Empire.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δείναρχος</foreign>). One of the ten Greek orators, for the explanation of whose orations Harpocration compiled his lexicon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanon-alexandrinus">Canon Alexandrinus</ref>.) He was a Corinthian by birth, but settled at Athens and became intimate with Theophrastus and Demetrius Phalereus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus fixes his birth at B.C. 361. The time of his highest reputation was after the death of Alexander, when Demosthenes and other great orators were dead or banished. He seems to have made a living by writing speeches for those who were in need of them. Having always been a friend to the aristocratic party, he was involved in a charge of conspiracy against the democracy and withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea. He was allowed to return to Athens after an absence of fifteen years. On his arrival, Dinarchus lodged with one Proxenus, an Athenian, a friend of his, who, however, if the story be true, robbed the old man of his money. Dinarchus brought an action against him, and, for the first time in his life, made his appearance in a court of justice. The charge against Proxenus, which is drawn up with a kind of legal formality, is preserved by Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Of the numerous orations of Dinarchus, only three remain, and these are not entitled to any very high praise. One of them is against Demosthenes, touching the affair of Harpalus. The best MSS. of Dinarchus are the Codex Cripsianus and the Codex Oxoniensis. The extant orations of Dinarchus are found in the usual collections of the Attic orators, especially Baiter and Sauppe's <title>Oratores Attici;</title> and an edition by Thalheim <bibl default="NO">(1887)</bibl>; elaborate commentary by Mätzner <bibl default="NO">(1842)</bibl>.

 <head><surname full="yes">Diocletiānus</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Gaius Valerius Iovius</foreName>
 <p>A celebrated Roman emperor, born of an obscure family in Dalmatia at the town of Dioclea, from which he derived his first name, which was probably Docles, afterwards lengthened to the more harmonious Greek form of Diocles, and at length, after his accession to the Empire, to the Roman form of Diocletianus. He likewise, on this occasion, assumed the patrician name of Valerius. Some, however, make him to have been born at Salona. His birth-year is also differently given. The common account says A.D. 245, but other statements make him ten years older. He was first a common soldier, and by merit and success gradually rose to rank, serving in Gaul and in Moesia under Probus, and being present at the campaign against the Persians when Carus perished in so mysterious a manner. He commanded the household or imperial body-guard when young Numerianus, the son of Carus, was secretly put to death by Aper, his father-in-law, while travelling in a litter on account of illness, on the return of the army from Persia. The death of Numerianus being discovered, after several days, by the soldiers near Chalcedon, they arrested Aper and proclaimed Diocletian emperor, who, addressing the army from his tribunal in the camp, protested his innocence of the death of Numerianus, and then, upbraiding Aper for the crime, plunged his sword into his body. Diocletian made his solemn entry into Nicomedia in September, A.D. 284, and afterwards chose this town for his favourite residence. Carinus, the other son of Carus, having collected a force to oppose Diocletian, the two armies met at Margum in Moesia, where the soldiers of Carinus had the advantage at first, but Carinus himself having been slain by one of his own officers, both armies joined in acknowledging Diocletian emperor, A.D. 285. Diocletian was generous after his victory, and, contrary to the common practice, there were no executions, proscriptions, or confiscations of property. He even retained most of the officers of Carinus in their places. Diocletian, on assuming the imperial power, found the Empire assailed in various quarters, but his talents and energy soon succeeded in counteracting these evils. In the year 286, he chose his old friend Maximian, a brave, but rude and uncultivated soldier, as his colleague, and it is to the credit <cb /> of both that the latter continued ever after faithful to Diocletian and willing to follow his advice. Maximian was stationed in Gaul, and on the German frontier, to repel invasion; Diocletian resided chiefly in the East, to watch the Persians, though he appears to have visited Rome in the early part of his reign. After the lapse of a few years Diocletian thought it necessary, in consequence of invasions and revolts in different parts of the Empire, to increase the number of his colleagues. On the 1st of March, 292, or, according to some, 291, he appointed Galerius a Caesar, and Maximian, at the same time, adopted, on his part, <figure id="fig.00515">
<head orig="Coin of Diocletian.">Coin of Diocletian.</head>
</figure> Constantius Chlorus. The two Caesars repudiated their respective wives; Galerius married Valeria, Diocletian's daughter, and Constantius married Theodora, daughter of Maximian. The two Caesars remained subordinate to the two Augusti, though each of the four was intrusted with the administration of a part of the Empire. Diocletian kept to himself Asia and Egypt; Maximian had Italy and Africa; Galerius, Thrace and Illyricum; and Constantius, Gaul and Spain. But it was rather an administrative than a political division. At the head of the edicts of each prince were put the names of all four, beginning with that of Diocletian. Diocletian resorted to this arrangement probably as much for reasons of internal as of external policy. By fixing upon three colleagues, one in each of the great divisions of the Empire, each having his army, and all mutually checking one another, Diocletian put a stop to military insolence and anarchy, though another danger remained—that of disputes and wars between the various sharers of the imperial power.</p>
 <p>The new Caesars justified Diocletian's expectations. Successful wars were waged in different quarters of the Empire; and though Galerius at first met with a defeat from Narses, king of Persia, yet, in the following year, he gave the Persians a terrible overthrow. Narses sued for peace, which was granted by Diocletian, on condition of the Persians giving up all the territory on the right or western bank of the Tigris. This peace was concluded in 297, and lasted forty years. At the same time Diocletian marched into Egypt against Achillaeus, whom he besieged in Alexandria, which he took after a siege of eight months, when the usurper and his chief adherents were put to death. Diocletian is said to have behaved on this occasion with unusual sternness, several towns of Egypt, among others Busiris and Coptos, being destroyed. For several years after this the Empire enjoyed repose, and Diocletian and his colleagues were chiefly employed in framing laws and administrative regulations and in constructing forts on the frontiers. Diocletian kept a splendid court at Nicomedia, which town he embellished with numerous structures. He, or rather Maximian by his order, caused the magnificent Thermae 
<pb n="516" /><cb />
 at Rome to be built, the remains of which still bear Diocletian's name, and which contained, besides the baths, a library, a museum, and other establishments.</p>
 <p>In February, 303, Diocletian issued an edict against the Christians, ordering their churches to be razed, their books to be burned, and all Christians to be dismissed from offices civil or military—with other penalties, exclusive, however, of death. Various causes have been assigned for this measure. It is known that Galerius had always been hostile to the Christians, while Diocletian had openly favoured them, and had employed them in his armies and about his person; and Eusebius speaks of the prosperity, security, and protection which they enjoyed under his reign. They had churches in most towns, and one at Nicomedia, in particular, under the very eye of the emperor. Just before the edict was issued, Galerius had repaired to Nicomedia to induce Diocletian to proscribe the Christians. He filled the emperor's mind with reports of conspiracies and seditions, and, aided by the artifices of the heathen priesthood, was at last successful. The barbarities that followed upon the issuing of the edict above referred to are beyond belief. Malicious ingenuity was racked to the utmost to devise tortures for the persecuted followers of Jesus. For the space of ten years did this persecution rage with scarcely mitigated horrors; and such multitudes were massacred in all parts of the Empire that at last the imperial murderers ventured to erect a triumphal column, bearing the barbarously boastful, yet false inscription, that they had extinguished the Christian name and superstition and restored the worship of the gods to its former purity and splendour. This was the last persecution under the Roman Empire.</p>
 <p>In November, 303, Diocletian repaired to Rome, where he and Maximian enjoyed the honour of a triumph, followed by festive games. This was the last triumph that Rome saw. The populace of that city complained of the economy of Diocletian on that occasion, and so offended him by their gibes and sarcasms that he left Rome abruptly, in the month of December, in very cold weather. A long illness ensued, which confined him at Nicomedia; and soon after his recovery he was visited by Galerius, who persuaded and almost forced him to abdicate. According to others, however, Diocletian did so spontaneously. Setting off for Salona, in Dalmatia, he built himself, near this place, an extensive palace by the sea-shore, in which he lived for the rest of his life, respected by the other emperors, without cares and without regret. At the same time that Diocletian abdicated at Nicomedia, Maximian, according to an agreement between them, performed a similar ceremony at Milan. Maximian retired to his seat in Lucania; but, not being endowed with the firmness of Diocletian, he tried some time after to recover his former power, and wrote to his old colleague to induce him to do the same. “Were you but to come to Salona,” answered Diocletian, “and see the vegetables which I raise in my garden with my own hands, you would no longer talk to me of empire.” Diocletian died May 1, 313.

<div2 id="crossdiodorus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Diodōrus">Diodorus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διόδωρος</foreign>). (1) An historian, surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sicŭlus</hi>, because born at Agyrium in Sicily, and the contemporary of Iulius Caesar and Augustus. <cb /> Our principal data for the events of his life are derived from his own work. In early life he travelled into Asia, Africa, and Europe, and on his return established himself at Rome, where he published a general history, in forty books, under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Βιβλιοθήκη Ἱστορική</foreign>, or Historical Library. To this labour he devoted thirty years of his life. The history comprehended a period of 1138 years, besides the time preceding the Trojan War, and was carried down to the end of Caesar's Gallic war. His work was written after the death of Caesar. The first six books were devoted to the fabulous history anterior to the war of Troy, and of these the three former to the antiquities of barbarian States, the three latter to the archaeology of the Greeks. But the historian, though treating of the fabulous history of the barbarians in the first three books, enters into an account of their manners and usages, and carries down the history of these nations to a point of time posterior to the Trojan War. Thus, in the first book he gives a sketch of Egyptian history from the reign of Menes to Amasis. In the eleven following books he details the different events which happened between the Trojan War and the death of Alexander the Great; while the remaining twenty-three books contain the history of the world down to the Gallic War and the conquest of Britain. We have only a small part remaining of this vast compilation—namely, the first five books; then from the eleventh to the twentieth, both inclusive; and, finally, fragments of the other books from the sixth to the tenth inclusive, and also of the last twenty. These rescued portions we owe to Eusebius ; to John Malalas, Georgius Syncellus, and other writers of the Lower Empire, who have cited them in the course of their own works; but, above all, to the authors of the “Extracts respecting Embassies” and of the “Extracts respecting Virtues and Vices.” We are indebted also for a part of them to the patriarch Photius, who has inserted in his <title>Myriobiblon</title> extracts from several of the books, from the thirtyfirst to the thirty-third, and from the thirty-sixth to the thirty-eighth and fortieth. Important additions have also been made from MSS. in the Vatican Library.</p>
 <p>A great advantage possessed by Diodorus over most of the ancient historians is his indicating the order of time, though it must be acknowledged at the same time that his chronology offers occasional difficulties and often needs educing. Diodorus, who wrote at Rome, and at a period when the dominion of that city extended over the greater part of the civilized world, arranges his narrative in accordance with the Roman calendar and consular <seg lang="la">fasti;</seg> but he frequently adds the names of the Athenian archons who were contemporaneous.</p>
 <p>With regard to the historical value of the work itself and the merits of the author, the most varying opinions have been entertained by modern writers. The principal fault of Diodorus seems to have been the too great extent of his work. It was not possible for any man living in the time of Augustus to write an unexceptionable universal history. It is not, then, a matter of surprise that Diodorus, who does not appear to have been a man of superior abilities, should have fallen into a number of particular errors and should have placed too much reliance on authorities sometimes far from trustworthy. Wherever he speaks from his own observation he may, perhaps, generally be relied 
<pb n="517" /><cb />
 upon; but when he is compiling from the writings of others he has shown little judgment in the selection. The literary style of Diodorus, though not very pure or elegant, is sufficiently perspicuous and presents but few difficulties, except where the MSS. are defective, as is frequently the case. The best editions of Diodorus are those of Wesseling <bibl default="NO">(1746)</bibl>, L. Dindorf <bibl default="NO">(1867-68)</bibl>, and Bekker <bibl default="NO">(1853-54)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) A native of Caria, and a disciple of the Megaric School. He was a great adept in that species of verbal combat which prevailed among the philosophers of his sect. It is said that a question was proposed to him in the presence of Ptolemy Soter by Stilpo, one of his fraternity, which he required <seg lang="la">time</seg> to answer, and on this account he was ridiculed by Ptolemy and denominated “Chronus” (<foreign lang="greek">Χρόνος</foreign>). Mortified at this defeat, he wrote a book on the question, but nevertheless died of vexation. He is the reputed author of the famous sophism against motion: “If any body be moved, it is moved either in the place where it is or in a place where it is not, for nothing can act or suffer where it is not, and therefore there is no such thing as motion.” Diodorus was rewarded for this discovery; for, having dislocated his shoulder, the surgeon who was sent for kept him for some time in torture, while he proved from the philosopher's own mode of reasoning that the bone could not have moved out of its place.</p>
 <p>(3) A Peripatetic philosopher, with whom the uninterrupted succession of the Peripatetic School terminated. He was a native of Tyre and a pupil of Critolaüs. Mention is often made of him in the selections of Stobaeus and also in the works of Cicero. The sovereign good, according to Diodorus, was to live in a becoming manner, free from toil and care, <foreign lang="greek">τὸ ἀμοχθήτως καὶ καλῶς ζῆν</foreign>, or, <seg lang="la">vacare omni molestia cum honestate</seg>, as Cicero expresses it (<title>Acad.</title> ii. 42).</p>
 <p>(4) An orator and epigrammatic poet, a native of Sardis. He was surnamed Zonas (<foreign lang="greek">Ζωνᾶς</foreign>). He fought in Asia and was contemporaneous with Mithridates the Great, against whom he was charged with conspiring. He defended himself successfully. Nine of his epigrams remain.</p>
 <p>(5) Another native of Sardis, who wrote historical works, odes, and epigrams. Strabo speaks of him as subsequent to the former and a contemporary and friend of his own. We have one of his epigrams remaining.

His father, Icesias, a banker, was convicted of debasing the public coin, and was obliged to leave the country; or, according to another account, his father and himself were charged with this offence, and the former was thrown into prison, while the son escaped and went to Athens. Here he attached himself, as a disciple, to Antisthenes, who was at the head of the Cynics. Antisthenes at first refused to admit him into his house and even struck him with a stick. Diogenes calmly bore the rebuke and said, “Strike me, Antisthenes, but you will never find a stick sufficiently hard to remove me from your presence, while you speak anything worth hearing.” The philosopher was so much pleased with this reply that he at once admitted him among his scholars. Diogenes fully adopted the <cb /> principles and character of his master. Renouncing every other object of ambition, he determined to distinguish himself by his contempt of riches and honours and by his invectives against luxury. He wore a coarse cloak, carried a wallet and a staff, made the porticoes and other public places his habitation, and depended upon casual contributions for his daily bread. A friend whom he had desired to procure him a cell not executing his order so soon as was expected, he took up his abode in a <foreign lang="greek">πίθος</foreign>, or large vessel, in the Metroum. It is probable, however, that this was only a temporary expression of indignation and contempt, and that he did not make it the settled place of his residence. This famous “tub” is indeed celebrated by Juvenal; it is also ridiculed by Lucian and mentioned by Seneca. But no notice is taken of so singular a circumstance by other ancient writers who have mentioned this philosopher. It cannot be doubted, however, that Diogenes practised the most hardy self-control and the most rigid abstinence—exposing himself to the utmost extremes of heat and cold and living upon the simplest diet, casually supplied by the hand of charity. In his old age, sailing to Aegina, he was taken by pirates and carried to Crete, where he was exposed to sale in the public market. When the auctioneer asked him what he could do, he said, “I can govern men; therefore sell me to one who wants a master.” Xeniades, a wealthy Corinthian, happening at that instant to pass by, was struck with the singularity of his reply and purchased him. On their arrival at Corinth, Xeniades gave him his freedom and committed to him the education of his children and the direction of his domestic concerns. Diogenes executed this trust with so much judgment and fidelity that Xeniades used to say that the gods had sent a good genius to his house. During his residence at Corinth, the interview between him and Alexander is said to have taken place. Plutarch relates that Alexander, when at Corinth, receiving the congratulations of all ranks on being appointed to command the army of the Greeks against the Persians, missed Diogenes among the number, with whose character he was not unacquainted. Curious to see one who had given so signal an instance of his haughty independence of spirit, Alexander went in search of him and found him sitting in his tub in the sun. “I am Alexander the Great,” said the monarch. “And I am Diogenes the Cynic,” replied the philosopher. Alexander then requested that he would inform him what service he could render him. “Stand from between me and the sun,” said the Cynic. Alexander, struck with the reply, said to his friends, who were ridiculing the whimsical singularity of the philosopher, “If I were not Alexander, I should wish to be Diogenes.” This story is too good to be omitted, but there are several circumstances which in some degree diminish its credibility. It supposes Diogenes to have lived in his tub at Corinth, whereas it is certain that he lived there in the house of Xeniades, and that, if he had ever dwelt in a tub, he left it behind him at Athens. Alexander, moreover, was at this time scarcely twenty years old, and could not call himself Alexander the Great, for he did not receive this title till his Persian and Indian expedition, after which he never returned to Greece; yet the whole transaction represents him as elated with the pride of conquest. Diogenes probably was visited by 
<pb n="518" /><cb />
 Alexander, when the latter held the general assembly of the Greeks at Corinth, and was received by him with rudeness and incivility, which may have given rise to the whole story. The philosopher at this time would have been about seventy years of age.</p>
 <p>Various accounts are given concerning the manner and time of his death. It seems most probable that he died at Corinth, of mere decay, in the ninetieth year of his age and in the 114th Olympiad. A column of Parian marble, terminating in the figure of a dog, was raised over his tomb. His fellow-townsmen of Sinopé also erected brazen statues in memory of the philosopher. Diogenes left behind him no system of philosophy. After the example of his school, he was more attentive to practical than to theoretical wisdom. See Hermann, <bibl default="NO"><title>Zur Geschichte und Kritik des Diogenes</title> (Heilbronn, 1860)</bibl>, and the article <ref type="cross" target="crosscynici">Cynici</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(2) A native of Apollonia in Crete, who was a pupil of Anaximenes and contemporary with Anaxagoras. Schleiermacher, however, affirms, from the internal evidence of the fragments of the two philosophers, that Diogenes preceded Anaxagoras. But Diogenes might have written before Anaxagoras and yet have been his junior, as we know was the case with Empedocles. Diogenes followed Anaximenes in making air the primal element of all things; but he carried his views further, and regarded the universe as issuing from an intelligent principle, by which it was at once vivified and ordered, a rational as well as sensitive soul, but still without recognizing any distinction between matter and mind. Diogenes wrote several books on Cosmology (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Φύσεως</foreign>).
 </p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crosslaertius">Laertius</ref>, so called from his native city, Laerté in Cilicia. He wrote the lives of the philosophers (<foreign lang="greek">Φιλόσοφοι Βίοι</foreign>), in ten books, which are still extant. The period when he lived is not exactly known, but it is supposed to have been during the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla. Diogenes is thought to have belonged to the Epicurean School. He divides all the Greek philosophers into two classes: those of the Ionic and those of the Italic school. He derives the first from Anaximander, the second from Pythagoras. After Socrates, he divides the Ionian philosophers into three branches: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Plato and the Academics, down to Clitomachus; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the Cynics, down to Chrysippus; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Aristotle and Theophrastus. The series of Italic philosophers consists, after Pythagoras, of the following: Telanges, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Leucippus, Democritus, and others down to Epicurus. The first seven books are devoted to the Ionic philosophers; the last three treat of the Italic school.</p>
 <p>The work of Diogenes is a crude contribution towards the history of philosophy. It contains a brief account of the lives, doctrines, and sayings <cb /> of most persons who have been called philosophers; and though the author is evidently a most unfit person for the task which he imposed upon himself, and has shown very little judgment and discrimination in the execution of it, yet the book is extremely useful as a collection of facts, which we could not have learned from any other quarter, and is entertaining as a sort of <hi rend="italic">pot-pourri</hi> on the subject. The article on Epicurus is valuable, as containing some original letters of that philosopher, which comprise a fairly satisfactory epitome of the Epicurean doctrines and are very useful to the readers of Lucretius. The best editions of Diogenes are those of Hübner <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1828-31)</bibl> and Cobet <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1850)</bibl>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διογενειανός</foreign>). A Greek grammarian of Heraclea.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διομήδειαι νῆσοι</foreign>). Five small islands in the Adriatic Sea, north of the promontory Garganum in Apulia, named after Diomedes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdiomedes">Diomedes</ref>.) The largest of these, called Diomedea Insula or Trimerus (Tremiti), was the place whither Iulia, the daughter of Augustus, was exiled ( <bibl n="Tac.

<div2 id="crossdiomedes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Diomēdes">Diomedes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διομήδης</foreign>). (1) The son of Tydeus and Deïpylé. He was king of Aetolia, and one of the bravest of the Grecian chiefs in the Trojan War, ranking next to Achilles and Aiax. Homer represents him as one of the favourites of Athené. Among his exploits, it is recorded of him that he engaged in single combat with Hector and Aeneas; that he wounded Ares, Aeneas, and Aphrodité; and that, in concert with Odysseus, he carried off the horses of Rhesus and the palladium, and secured the arrows of Philoctetes. Diomedes was deprived of the affection of his wife Aegialé through the wrath and vengeance of Aphrodité, by whose influence, during his absence at the war, she had become attached to Cyllabarus, the son of Sthenelus. Diomedes was so afflicted at the estrangement of Aegialé that he abandoned Greece and settled at the head of a colony in Magna Graecia, where he founded a city, to which he gave the name of Argyripa, and married a daughter of Daunus, prince of the country. In the progress of his voyage to Italy, Diomedes was shipwrecked on that part of the Libyan coast which was under the sway of Lycus , who seized and confined him. He was, however, liberated by Callirrhoé, the tyrant's daughter, who became so fond of him that upon his quitting the African shores she put herself to death. Diomedes, according to one account, died in Italy at a very advanced age; while another legend makes him to have been slain by his father-in-law Daunus. His companions were so much afflicted by his death that they were changed into birds. Vergil, however, makes this transformation earlier in date, and to have taken place during the lifetime of Diomedes ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 11. 272" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>xi. 272</bibl>). He seems to have followed the tradition recorded by Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 14. 457" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>xiv. 457</bibl>), that Agnon, one of Diomedes's companions in his voyage from Troy, insulted Aphrodité with contemptuous language, and that the goddess, in revenge, transformed not only Agnon, but many 
<pb n="519" /><cb />
 others of Diomedes's followers into birds. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdiomedeae-insulae">Diomedeae Insulae</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(2) A king of the Bistones, in Thrace, son of Ares and Cyrené. His mares fed on human flesh. Heracles sailed to this quarter, having been ordered, as his eighth labour, to bring these mares to Mycenae. The hero overcame the grooms of Diomedes and led the mares to the sea. The Bistones pursued with arms. Heracles, leaving the mares in charge of Abderus, one of his companions, went to engage the foe. Meantime the mares tore their keeper to pieces; and the hero, having defeated the Bistones and slain Diomedes, built a city by the tomb of Abderus, which he called Abdera after him. Heracles brought the mares to Eurystheus, who turned them loose, and they strayed to Mount Olympus, where they were destroyed by the wild beasts ( <bibl n="Apollod.  2.5.8" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.ii.5.8</bibl>). Another account makes Heracles to have given Diomedes to be devoured by his own mares, and Eurystheus to have consecrated them to Heré ( <bibl n="Diod.  4. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.iv. 15</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) A Roman grammarian of the fourth century A.D., whose work, entitled <title>Ars Grammatica</title>, has come down to us in three books. It is taken from the same sources as the contemporary work by <ref type="cross" target="crosscharisius">Charisius</ref> (q.v.), and is chiefly valuable for the notices on literary history contained in the third book and taken from the <title>De Poetis</title> of Suetonius.

<head orig="Dion">Dion</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δίων</foreign>). (1) An inhabitant of Syracuse, who became a disciple of Plato, invited to the court of Syracuse by the elder Dionysius. He was nearly connected with Dionysius by having married his daughter, and because his sister was one of his wives; and he was also much esteemed by him, so as to be employed on several embassies. At the accession of the younger Dionysius, Plato was again, at Dion's request, invited to Syracuse. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossplato">Plato</ref>.) In order, however, to counteract his influence, the courtiers obtained the recall of Philistus, a man notorious for his adherence to arbitrary principles. This faction determined to supplant Dion, and availed themselves of a real or supposititious letter to fix on him the charge of treason. Dion, precluded from defence, was transported to Italy, and from thence proceeded to Greece, where he was received with great honour. Dionysius became jealous of his popularity in Greece, especially at Athens, stopped his remittances, confiscated his estates, and compelled his wife, who had been left at Syracuse as an hostage, to marry another person. Dion, incensed at this treatment, determined to expel the tyrant. Plato resisted his intentions; but, encouraged by other friends, he assembled a body of troops, and with a small force sailed to Sicily, took advantage of the absence of Dionysius in Italy, and freed the people from his control. Dionysius returned; but, after some conflicts, was compelled to escape to Italy. The austere and philosophic manners of Dion, however, soon lost him the favour of his countrymen, and he was supplanted by Heraclides, a Syracusan exile, and obliged to make his retreat to Leontini. He afterwards regained the ascendency and caused Heraclides to be assassinated, which robbed him ever after of his peace of mind. An Athenian, an intimate friend, formed a conspiracy against his <cb /> life, and Dion was assassinated in the fifty-fifth year of his age, B.C. 354 ( <bibl n="Diod.  16. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xvi. 6</bibl> foll.; <title>Dion.</title>; Corn. Nep. <title>Dion</title>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dio Cassius Cocceiānus</hi>, son of Cassius Apronianus, a Roman senator, born A.D. 155, at Nicaea, in Bithynia. His true name was Cassius, but he assumed the other two names, as being descended on the mother's side from Dion Chrysostom. Thus, though he was on his mother's side of Greek descent, and though, in his writings, he adopted the prevailing language—Greek—of his native province, he must be considered as a Roman. Dio Cassius passed the greater part of his life in public employments. He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus; and afterwards consul, as also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia. Alexander Severus entertained the highest esteem for him, and made him consul for the second time, with himself, though the Praetorian Guards, irritated against him on account of his severity, had demanded his life. When advanced in years (about A.D. 229), he returned to his native country. Dio published a Roman history, in eighty books, the fruit of his researches and labours for the space of twenty-two years. It embraced a period of 983 years, extending from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy, and the subsequent founding of Rome, to A.D. 229. Down to the time of Iulius Caesar, he only gives a summary of events; after this, he enters somewhat more into details; and from the time of Commodus he is very circumstantial in relating what passed under his own eyes. We have fragments remaining of the first thirty-six books: but there is a considerable portion of the thirtyfifth book, on the war of Lucullus against Mithridates, and of the thirty-sixth, on the war with the pirates and the expedition of Pompey against the king of Pontus. The books that follow, to the fifty-fourth inclusive, are nearly all entire: they comprehend a period from B.C. 65 to B.C. 12, or from the eastern campaign of Pompey and the death of Mithridates to the death of Agrippa. The fifty-fifth book has a considerable gap in it. The fifty-sixth to the sixtieth, both included, which comprehend the period from A.D. 9 to A.D. 54, are complete, and contain the events from the defeat of Varus in Germany to the death of Claudius. Of the following twenty books we have only fragments and the meagre abridgment of Xiphilinus. The eightieth or last book comprehends the period from A.D. 222 to A.D. 229, in the reign of Alexander Severus. The abridgment of Xiphilinus, as now extant, commences with the thirty-fifth and continues to the end of the eightieth book. It is a very indifferent performance, and was made by order of the emperor Michael VII., Parapinaces. The abbreviator, Xiphilinus, was a monk of the eleventh century.</p>
 <p>The fragments of the first thirty-six books, as now collected, are of four kinds: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fragmenta Valesiāna</hi>, such as were dispersed throughout various writers, scholiasts, grammarians, lexicographers, etc., and were collected by Henri de Valois. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fragmenta Peiresciāna</hi>, comprising large extracts, found in the section entitled “Of Virtues and Vices,” in the great collection or portative library compiled by order of Constantine VII., Porphyrogenitus. The manuscript of this belonged to Peiresc. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The fragments of the first thirty-four books, preserved in the second 
<pb n="520" /><cb />
 section of the same work of Constantine's, entitled “Of Embassies.” These are known under the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Fragmenta Ursiniāna</hi>, because the manuscript containing them was found in Sicily by Fulvio Orsini. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Excerpta Vaticāna</hi>, by Mai, which contain fragments of books i.-xxxv. and lxi.-lxxx. To these are added the fragments of an unknown continuator of Dio , which go down to the time of Constantine. Other fragments from Dio belonging chiefly to the first thirtyfive books were found by Mai in two Vatican MSS., which contain a collection made by Maximus Planudes. The annals of Zonaras also contain numerous extracts from Dion.</p>
 <p> Dio has taken Thucydides for his model; but the imitator is comparable with his original neither in arrangement and the distribution of materials nor in soundness of view and just and accurate reasoning. His style is generally clear, where there appears to be no corruption of the text, though full of Latinisms. His diligence is unquestionable, and, from his opportunities, he was well acquainted with the circumstances of the Empire during the period for which he is a contemporary authority; and, indeed, we may assign a high value to his history of the whole period from the time of Augustus to his own age. Nor is his work without value for the earlier periods of Roman history, in which, though he has fallen into errors, like all the Greek and Roman writers who have handled the same obscure subject, he still enables us to correct some erroneous statements of Livy and Dionysius. The best editions are those of Fabricius, completed by Reimar, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Hamb. 1751)</bibl>; of Sturz, 8 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1824-25)</bibl>; of Bekker <bibl default="NO">(1849)</bibl>; and especially of L. Dindorf (revised by Melber, 1890 foll.). The small Tauchnitz edition, 4 vols. 16mo, contains all the fragments.
 </p>
 <p>(3) Surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crosschrysostomus">Chrysostŏmus</ref>, or the Goldenmouthed, on account of the beauty of his style, was a native of Prusa in Bithynia, born about A.D. 50. He was a sophist and Being in Egypt when Vespasian, who had been proclaimed emperor by his own army, came there, he was consulted by that prince on the proper course to be adopted under the circumstances. Dion had the candour to advise him to restore the Republic. Afterwards he resided for years at Rome, till, one of his friends having engaged in a conspiracy against Domitian, Dion, fearing for himself, fled to what is now Moldavia, where he remained till the tyrant's death, labouring for his subsistence with his own hands. Domitian having been assassinated, the legions quartered on the Danube were about to revolt, when Dion got upon an altar and harangued them so effectually that they submitted to the decision of the Senate. Dion was in high favour with Nerva and Trajan, and when the latter triumphed after his Dacian victories the orator sat in the emperor's car in the procession. He returned to Bithynia, where he spent the remainder of his life. Accusations of peculation and treason were brought against him, but rejected as frivolous. He died at an advanced age, but it is not known in what year. We have eighty orations attributed to him, which are very neatly written in pure Attic Greek, but are not of much intrinsic value. The best editions are those of Reiske, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1784)</bibl>; Emper <bibl default="NO">(1844)</bibl>; and L. Dindorf <bibl default="NO">(1857)</bibl>.

<head orig="Dionysia">Dionysia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ Διονύσια</foreign>). A celebration in honour of <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysus">Dionysus</ref> (q.v.), which was held in Athens in a special series of festivals, namely:</p>
 <p>(1) The <ref type="cross" target="crossoschophoria">Oschophoria</ref>, supposed to have been instituted by Theseus on his return from Crete. This was celebrated in the month of Pyanepsion (October to November), when the grapes were ripe. It was so called from the shoots of vine (<foreign lang="greek">ὄσχοι</foreign>) with grapes on them, which were borne in a race from the temple of Dionysus in Limnae, a southern suburb of Athens, to the sanctuary of Athené Sciras , in the harbour town of Phalerum. The bearers and runners were twenty youths (<foreign lang="greek">ἔφηβοι</foreign>) of noble descent whose parents were still living, two being chosen from each of the ten tribes. The victor received a goblet containing a drink made of wine, cheese, meal, and honey, and an honorary place in the procession which followed the race. This procession, in which a chorus of singers was preceded by two youths in woman's clothing, marched from the temple of Athené to that of Dionysus. The festival was concluded by a sacrifice and a banquet.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">smaller</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ μικρά</foreign>), or <hi rend="SmallCaps">rustic Dionysia</hi>. This feast was held in the month of Poseideon (December to January), at the first tasting of the new wine. It was celebrated, with much rude merriment, throughout the various country districts. The members of the different tribes first went in solemn processions to the altar of the god, on which a goat was offered in sacrifice. The sacrifice was followed by feasting and revelry, with abundance of jesting and mockery and dramatic improvisations. Out of these were developed the elements of the regular drama (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdrama">Drama</ref>), for in the more prosperous villages, pieces—in most cases the same as had been played at the urban Dionysia—were performed by itinerant troupes of actors. The festival lasted some days, one of its chief features being the Ascoliasmus, or bag-dance. The point of this was to dance on one leg, without falling, upon oiled bags of inflated leather. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossascolia">Ascolia</ref>.) The <foreign lang="greek">Ἁλῷα</foreign>, Harvest-home (or Feast of Threshing-floors), was celebrated at Athens and in the country in the same month to Demeter and Persephoné in common.
 </p>
 <p>(3) The <ref type="cross" target="crosslenaea">Lenaea</ref> (<foreign lang="greek">Λήναια</foreign>), or Feast of Vats. This was held at Athens in the month of Gamelion (January to February), at the Lenaeun, the oldest and most venerable sanctuary of Dionysus in the city. After a great banquet, for which the meat was provided at the public expense, the citizens went in procession through the city, with the usual jesting and mockery, to attend the representation of the tragedies and comedies at the theatre.
 </p>
 <p>(4) The <ref type="cross" target="crossanthesteria">Anthesteria</ref>. Celebrated for three days in Anthesterion (February to March). On the first day (<foreign lang="greek">Πιθοιγία</foreign>, or opening of casks) the casks were first opened, and masters and servants alike tasted the new wine. On the second (<foreign lang="greek">Χόες</foreign>, or Feast of Beakers), a public banquet was held, at which a beaker of new wine was set by each guest. This was drunk with enthusiasm, to the sound of trumpets. The most important ceremony, however, was the marriage of the Basilissa, or wife of the Archon Basileus, with Dionysus, the Basilissa being regarded 
<pb n="521" /><cb /> as representing the country. The ceremony took place in the older of the two temples in the Lenaeun, which was never opened except on this occasion. The last day was called <foreign lang="greek">Χύτροι</foreign>, or the Feast of Pots, because on this day they made offerings of cooked pulse in pots to Hermes, as guide of the dead, and to the souls of the departed, especially those who had perished in the flood of Deucalion.
 </p>
 <p>(5) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">great urban Dionysia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ μέγαλα</foreign>). This festival was held at Athens for six days in the month of Elaphebolion (March to April) with great splendour, and attended by multitudes from the surrounding country and other parts of Greece. A solemn procession was formed, representing a train of Dionysiac revellers. Choruses of boys sang dithyrambs, and an old wooden statue of Dionysus, worshipped as the liberator of the land from the bondage of winter, was borne from the Lenaeum to a small temple in the neighbourhood of the Acropolis and back again. The glory of this festival was the performance of the new tragedies, comedies, and satyric dramas, which took place, with lavish expenditure, on three consecutive days. In consequence of the immense number of citizens and strangers assembled, it was found convenient to take one of these six days for conferring public distinctions on meritorious persons, as in the case of the presentation of the golden crown to Demosthenes.</p>
 <p>The Dionysia were celebrated at Rome under the name of <ref type="cross" target="crossbacchanalia">Bacchanalia</ref>. The circumstances of their introduction are given in detail by Livy , (xxxix. 8-19). According to his account, a Greek priest brought into Etruria the secret nightly celebration of this worship. It was not only accompanied by all manner of licentious excesses, but was also made the occasion for planning the most revolting crimes—perjury, forgery, false accusations, poisoning, and assassination. From Etruria the contagion spread to Rome. According to Livy , at first the rites were comparatively innocent. Women only were initiated, and that by day, three times in the year, and the priesthood was held by matrons in turn. It is quite possible that in this statement Livy has in view the worship of Stimula or Simila, an early Italian deity, afterwards identified with Semelé, whence Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 503" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 503</bibl>-515) regards her rites as of a Bacchanalian character. Possibly Vergil is thinking of the same when ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 7. 385" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aen.</title>vii. 385</bibl>) he speaks of the Bacchic rites as existing in Italy in the time of Aeneas. In any case it is hardly conceivable that the corrupt Etruscan cult should have so much changed its character in passing into Rome as Livy 's account would require us to believe. He goes on to tell how a certain Pacullia Annia, a Campanian priestess, claiming to be acting under the inspiration of the gods, changed the whole character of the worship. She was the first to admit men, by initiating her own sons; she altered the time of celebration from the day to the night, and held initiations five times every month instead of three times a year. The promiscuous admission of men and women and the license of night opened the way to all manner of debauchery and crime. The most horrible immoralities were practised, the wildest frenzy indulged in. Men flung themselves about as if possessed, and uttered frantic prophecies; women dressed as Bacchanals, with dishevelled locks, ran down to the Tiber and <cb /> plunged into the water torches which, composed of a mixture of sulphur and lime, were not extinguished in the waves. The initiated were a vast number, including many of high birth, both men and women. To secure the complete subjugation of the votaries a rule was made that none should be admitted who were not under twenty years of age, a time at which the judgment is weak and the passions strong. For some time, although the existence of these rites was generally known, not only by report, but also by the clanging of cymbals and the howlings of the devotees by night, their real nature was not suspected. But in B.C. 186, the lewd and criminal character of the meetings was brought to the knowledge of the consuls. P. Aebutius, the orphan of a Roman knight, had been left by the death of his guardians to the charge of his mother Duronia and his stepfather Sempronius Rutilus. The latter had embezzled his property, and in order to escape punishment desired either to make away with the youth or to get him wholly into his power. Duronia, who was entirely devoted to her husband, determined to avail herself of the Bacchanalia for the corruption or destruction of her son. She informed him that at a time when he was ill she had vowed that he should be initiated into the Bacchic rites if he recovered, and that now was the time to discharge the vow. Aebutius, taking the matter lightly, mentioned it to a freed woman, Hispala Fecenia, with whom he had a <hi rend="italic">liaison;</hi> but she, in the utmost terror and distress, warned him of the dangers that he was incurring—she, when still a slave, had accompanied her mistress to the orgies, and had seen the vile practices of the votaries. Aebutius, returning to his mother, refused to be initiated, without disclosing his reasons. She, in a fury, drove him from the house. He took refuge with his father's sister, and at her advice laid the whole facts of the case before the consuls. Hispala was induced by them to confess all that she knew. The Senate was consulted and full powers given to the consuls to investigate the matter. Prompt measures were taken to secure evidence and to prevent the escape of the guilty. The inquiry led to the belief that more than 7000 men and women were implicated in the affair. Those who were merely initiated, and had taken the oath binding them to every kind of crime and lewdness, were punished with imprisonment; those against whom actual guilt was found—and these, we are told, were the majority—received capital punishment. The women for the most part were handed over to their relations, or to those who were responsible for them, for private execution; the rest were put to death in public.</p>
 <p>One of the most ancient and precious records of the old Latin language preserved to us is the bronze tablet, commonly called the <ref type="cross" target="crosssenatus-consultum-de-bacchanalibus">Senātus Consultum de Bacchanalĭbus</ref>, containing the letter in which the consuls communicated to the magistrates <title>in agro Teurano</title> (Tirioli, in the country of the Bruttii) part (as Mommsen thinks) of the decree of the Senate passed on this occasion (cf. Mommsen, <title>C. I. L.</title> i. 196; Ritschl, <title>P. L. M. E.</title> tab. xviii.; Allen's <title>Early Latin</title>, pp. 28-31 [Boston, 1880]; and Cortese, <title>Latini Sermonis Vetustioris Exempla</title>, p. 9 [Turin, 1892]). Doubtless it is only a specimen of many which <seg lang="la">mutatis mutandis</seg> were sent throughout Italy. The Bacchanalia are rigidly prohibited: if any one, Roman, Latin, or ally, considers himself 
<pb n="522" /><cb />
 under a religious obligation <seg lang="la">bacanal habere</seg>, he can only do so by obtaining permission from the <seg lang="la">praetor urbanus</seg>, confirmed by a vote of the Senate in which not less than one hundred have taken part. No priest, president, or common purse is allowed, nor any kind of common vow. Not more than two men or three women (five in all) may celebrate the rites, except by special permission. These regulations were carried out with unflinching rigour, apparently not without the use of military force ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 15, 37); but it was some years before the Bacchanalian rites were completely extinguished in southern Italy ( <bibl n="Liv.  39. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxix. 41</bibl>, xl. 19). The <ref type="cross" target="crossliberalia">Liberalia</ref> (q.v.) were of an entirely different character. The bronze tablet mentioned above is now preserved at Vienna.

<head orig="Dionysius">Dionysius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διονύσιος</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Elder</hi>, a celebrated tyrant of Syracuse, raised to that high rank from the station of a simple citizen, was born in that city, B.C. 430. He was son-in-law to Hermocrates, who, having been banished by an adverse party, attempted to return by force of arms and was killed in the action. Dionysius was dangerously wounded, but he recovered and was afterwards recalled. In time he caused himself to be nominated one of the generals, and, under pretence of raising a force sufficient to resist the Carthaginians, obtained a decree for recalling all the exiles, to whom he gave arms. Being sent to the relief of Gela, then besieged by the Carthaginians, he effected nothing against the enemy, pretending that he was not seconded by the other commanders; and his friends suggested that, in order to save the State, the supreme power ought to be confided to one man, reminding the people of the times of Gelon, who had defeated the Carthaginians. The General Assembly therefore proclaimed Dionysius supreme chief of the Republic about B.C. 405, when he was twenty-five years of age. He increased the pay of the soldiers, enlisted new ones, and, under pretence of a conspiracy against his person, formed a guard of mercenaries. He then proceeded to the relief of Gela, but failed in the attack on the Carthaginian camp; he, however, penetrated into the town, the inhabitants of which he advised to leave it quietly in the night under the escort of his troops. On his retreat he persuaded those of Camarina to do the same. This raised suspicion among his troops, and a party of horsemen, riding on before the rest, raised, on their arrival at Syracuse, an insurrection against Dionysius, plundered his house, and treated his wife so cruelly that she died in consequence. Dionysius, with a chosen body, followed close after, set fire to the gate of Acradina, forced his way into the city, put to death the leaders of the revolt, and remained undisputed possessor of the supreme power. The Carthaginians, being afflicted by a pestilence, made proposals of peace, which were accepted by Dionysius, and he then applied himself to fortifying Syracuse, and especially the island of Ortygia, which he made his stronghold, and which he peopled entirely with his trusty partisans and mercenaries, by the aid of whom he put down several revolts. After reducing the towns of Leontini, Catana, and Naxus, he engaged in a new war with Carthage, in which he met with the most <cb /> brilliant success, making himself master of numerous towns in Sicily, and becoming eventually feared both in Italy and Sicily. In order to raise money, he allied himself with the Illyrians, and proposed to them the joint plunder of the temple of Delphi; the enterprise, however, failed. He then plundered several temples, such as that of Persephoné at Locri; and as he sailed back with the plunder, with a fair wind, he, being a humourist in his way, observed to his friends, “You see how the immortal gods favour sacrilege.” Having carried off a golden mantle from a statue of Zeus, consecrated by Gelon out of the spoils of the Carthaginians, he replaced it by a woollen garment, saying that this was better suited to the vicissitudes of the seasons. He also took away a golden beard from Aesculapius, observing that it was not becoming for the son of a beardless father (Apollo) to make a display of his own beard. He likewise appropriated to himself the silver tables and golden vases and crowns in the temples, saying that he would make use of the bounty of the gods ( <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 3. 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>iii. 34</bibl>). He made a descent with a fleet on the coast of Etruria, and plundered the temple at Caeré or Agylla of 1000 talents. With these resources he was preparing himself for a new expedition to Italy, when a fresh Carthaginian armament landed in Sicily, B.C. 383, and defeated Dionysius, whose brother Leptines fell in the battle. A peace followed, of which Carthage dictated the conditions.</p>
 <p>This peace lasted fourteen years, during which Dionysius remained the undisturbed ruler of Syracuse and one half of Sicily, with part of southern Italy. He sent colonies to the coasts of the Adriatic, and his fleets navigated both seas. Twice he sent assistance to his old ally, Sparta: once against the Athenians, B.C. 374, and again in 369 after the battle of Leuctra, when the Spartans were hard pressed by Epaminondas. Meantime the court of Dionysius was frequented by many distinguished men, philosophers and poets. Plato is said to have been among the former, being invited by <ref type="cross" target="crossdion">Dion</ref> (q.v.), the brother-in-law of Dionysius; but the philosopher's declamations against tyranny led to his being sent away from Syracuse. The poets fared little better, as Dionysius himself aspired to poetical fame, for which, however, he was not so well qualified as for political success. Those who did not praise his verses were in danger of being led to prison. Dionysius twice sent some of his poems to be recited at the Olympic Games, but they were hissed by the assembly. He was more successful at Athens. A tragedy of his obtained the prize, and the news of his success almost turned his brain. He had just concluded a fresh truce with the Carthaginians, after having made an unsuccessful attack on Lilybaeum, at the expiration of the fourteen years' peace; and he now gave himself up to rejoicings and feastings for his poetical triumph. In a debauch with his friends he ate and drank so intemperately that he fell senseless, and soon after died, B.C. 367, in the sixty-third year of his age, having been tyrant of Syracuse for thirtyeight years. Dionysius, his elder son by Doris, succeeded him in the sovereignty.</p>
 <p>Dionysius was a clever statesman and generally successful in his undertakings. He did much to strengthen and extend the power of Syracuse, and it was probably owing to him that all Sicily did not fall into the hands of the Carthaginians. He was unscrupulous, rapacious, and vindictive; but 
<pb n="523" /><cb />
 several of the stories related of his cruelty and suspicious temper appear improbable, or at least exaggerated. An account of the famous prison, or “Ear of Dionysius,” will be found under the title <ref type="cross" target="crosslautumiae">Lautumiae</ref>.</p>
 <p>(2) The second of the name, styled <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Younger</hi>, was son of Dionysius I. by Doris. His father, whom he succeeded, had left the State in a prosperous condition, but young Dionysius had neither his abilities nor his prudence and experience. He followed at first the advice of Dion, who, although a republican in principle, had remained faithful to his father, and who now endeavoured to direct the inexperienced son for the good of his country. For this purpose Dion invited his friend Plato to Syracuse, about B.C. 364. Dionysius received the philosopher with great respect, and, in deference to his advice, reformed for a while his loose habits and the manners of his court. But a faction, headed by Philistus, who had always been a supporter of the tyranny of the elder Dionysius, succeeded in prejudicing the son against both Dion and Plato. Dion was exiled, under pretence that he had written privately to the Senate of Carthage for the purpose of concluding a peace. Plato urgently demanded of Dionysius the recall of Dion, and not being able to obtain it, he left Syracuse, after which Dionysius gave himself up to debauchery without restraint. Dion, meanwhile, was travelling through Greece, where his character gained him numerous friends. Dionysius, moved by jealousy, confiscated his property and obliged his wife to marry another. Upon this, Dion collected a small force at Zacynthus, with which he sailed for Sicily and entered Syracuse without resistance. Dionysius retired to the citadel in Ortygia, and after some resistance, in which Philistus, his best supporter, was taken prisoner and put to death, he quitted Syracuse by sea and retired to Locri, the country of his mother, where he had connections and friends. Dion having been treacherously murdered, several tyrants succeeded each other in Syracuse, until Dionysius himself came and retook it about B.C. 346. Instead, however, of profiting by his ten years' exile, he had grown worse. Having, during the interval of his absence from Syracuse, usurped the supreme power in Locri, he had committed many atrocities, had put to death several citizens and abused their wives and daughters. Upon his return to Syracuse, his cruelty and profligacy drove away a great number of people, who emigrated to various parts of Italy and Greece, while others joined Hicetas, tyrant of Leontini and a former friend of Dion. The latter sent messengers to Corinth to request assistance against Dionysius. The Corinthians appointed Timoleon leader of the expedition. This commander landed in Sicily, B.C. 344, entered Syracuse, and soon after obliged Dionysius to surrender. Dionysius was sent to Corinth, where he spent the remainder of his life in the company of actors and low women. Some say that at one time he kept a school. Several repartees are related of him, in answer to those who taunted him upon his altered fortunes, which are not destitute of wit or wisdom ( <title>Dion;</title> <bibl n="Diod.  16. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod. Sic.xvi. 5</bibl> foll.).</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Dionysius Thrax</hi>, a celebrated Greek grammarian, a native of Byzantium, or perhaps of Alexandria (Suidas). Coming to Rome about B.C. 80, he engaged in teaching rhetoric and grammar. Of numerous manuals, commentaries, etc., that he <cb /> published, one entitled <foreign lang="greek">Τέχνη Γραμματική</foreign> has come down to us, and is of very great importance, as it became the basis for all subsequent grammars, and for many centuries was a standard text-book, either in the original or in Latin translations. From it, through the Latin equivalents, came the technical terms of modern grammar, such as “case” (<seg lang="la">casus</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">πτῶσις</foreign>), “plural” (<seg lang="la">pluralis</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">πληθυντικός</foreign>), “singular” (<seg lang="la">singularis</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ἑνικός</foreign>), “nominative” (<seg lang="la">nominativus</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">ὀνομαστική</foreign>), etc. In the fourth century the book was translated into Armenian, and this version, which contains five more chapters than the Greek MSS., has given a definitive text of the whole. It is to be found in Bekker's <bibl default="NO"><title>Anecdota Graeca</title> (Berlin, 1821)</bibl>, but especially in the recent edition by Uhlig <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1884)</bibl>. A French translation is given in Cirbied, <bibl default="NO"><title>Mémoires et Dissertations sur les Antiquités Nationales et Étrangères</title> (Paris, 1824)</bibl>. On Dionysius see Gräfenhan, <title>Geschichte d. Class.

 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Halicarnassensis</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Halicarnasseus</hi>, an historian and critic, born at Halicarnassus in the first century B.C. We know nothing of his history beyond what he has told us himself. He states that he came to Italy at the termination of the civil war between Augustus and Antony (B.C. 29), and that he spent the following two-and-twenty years at Rome in learning the Latin language and in collecting materials for his history. He died at Rome, B.C. 7. The principal work of Dionysius is his work on Roman antiquities (<foreign lang="greek">Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία</foreign>), which commenced with the early history of the people of Italy and terminated with the beginning of the First Punic War, B.C. 265. It originally consisted of twenty books, of which the first ten remain entire. The eleventh breaks off in the year B.C. 312, but several fragments of the latter half of the history are preserved in the collection of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, and to these a valuable addition was made in 1816, by Mai, from an old MS. Besides, the first three books of Appian were founded entirely upon Dionysius, and Plutarch's biography of Camillus must also be considered as a compilation mostly taken from the <title>Antiquitates Romanae</title>, so that perhaps, upon the whole, we have not lost much of his work. The intention of the author in writing his history was to give the Greeks a more accurate and favourable idea than they had hitherto entertained of the Roman people and its civilization, for it had always fretted the Easterns to have been conquered by a race of mere “barbarians.” The work is founded upon a very careful and thorough study of authorities, and is one of our chief sources of information upon ancient Roman history in its internal and external development. Good editions of the <title>Antiquitates</title> are those of Reiske, 6 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1774-76)</bibl>, Schwartz <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1877)</bibl>, and Jacoby 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(1885-88)</bibl>. The first edition in the original Greek was that of R. Stephanus <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1546)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>Dionysius also wrote a treatise on rhetoric (<foreign lang="greek">Τέχνη Ρητορική</foreign>); criticisms (<foreign lang="greek">Τῶν Ἀρχαίων Κρίσις</foreign>) on the style of Thucydides, Lysias, Isocrates, Isaeus , Dinarchus, Plato, and Demosthenes; a treatise on the arrangement of words (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Συνθέσεως Ὀνομάτων</foreign>); and some other short essays. The first complete 
<pb n="524" /><cb />
 edition of the entire works of Dionysius was that of Sylburg <bibl default="NO">(Frankfort, 1586; reprinted at Leipzig, 1691)</bibl>. More recent editors of the rhetorical works are Gros <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1826)</bibl> and Westermann.</p>
 <p>(5) The author of a Greek poem in 1186 hexameters, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Τῆς Γῆς Οἰκουμένης Περιήγησις</foreign>, “A Description of the Habitable World.” It is not clearly ascertained where he was born. The probability is, however, that he was a native of Charax in Susiana. It is uncertain, also, when he flourished; he belonged, however, according to the general opinion, to the latter part of the third or the beginning of the fourth century A.D. He derived from his poem the surname of Periegetes. This production of his has little merit as a work of imagination and but feeble interest for the geographer. The commentary, however, of Eustathius upon it possesses some value from the miscellaneous information which is scattered throughout. There are two Latin translations of the poem—one by Rufus Festus <ref type="cross" target="crossavienus">Avienus</ref> (q.v.) and the other by <ref type="cross" target="crosspriscianus">Priscianus</ref> (q.v.). The last and best edition of the <title>Periegesis</title> is that of Bernhardy <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1828)</bibl>, in the first volume of his <title>Geographi Graeci Minores.</title></p>
 <p>(6) A Christian writer, called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Areopagīta</hi>, from his having been a member of the court of Areopagus at Athens. He was converted to Christianity by St. Paul's preaching (Acts, xvii. 34). He is reported to have been the first bishop of Athens, being appointed to that office by the apostle Paul, and to have suffered martyrdom under Domitian. His fundamental thought is the absolute transcendence of God. During the Middle Ages a great number of writings were circulated under his name, and were collected together and printed at Cologne in 1536, and subsequently at Antwerp in 1634 and at Paris in 1646. They have now, for a long time, been deemed spurious, although scholars differ in respect to the times and authors of the fabrication. The most probable reasoning, however, fixes them at the end of the fourth century. The standard text is that of Corderius, reprinted by the Abbé Migne. Trans. by Parker <bibl default="NO">(1894)</bibl>. See Harnack's <title>Dogmengeschichte</title>, vol. ii., and the studies by Niemeyer <bibl default="NO">(1869)</bibl> and Schneider <bibl default="NO">(1884)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(7) Surnamed <hi rend="SmallCaps">Exiguus</hi>, or “the Little,” on account of the smallness of his stature, a Scythian monk of the sixth century, who became an abbot at Rome. Cassiodorus, who was his intimate friend, speaks highly of his learning and character. At the request of Stephen, bishop of Salona, he drew up a body of canons entitled <title>Collectio sive Codex Canonum Ecclesiasticorum</title>, etc., translated from the Greek, containing the first fifty apostolical canons, as they are called, with those of the councils of Nice, Constantinople, Chalcedon, Sardis, and including 138 canons of certain African councils. He afterwards drew up a collection of the decretals. To him some ascribe the mode of computing the time of Easter, and of dating from the birth of Christ.</p>

<head orig="Dionȳsus">Dionysus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διώνυσος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Διόνυσος</foreign>). The god of luxuriant fertility, especially as displayed by the vine; and therefore the god of wine. His native place, according to the usual tradition, was Thebes, where he was born to Zeus by <ref type="cross" target="crosssemele">Semelé</ref> (q.v.), the daughter of Cadmus. Semelé was destroyed by the lightning of her lover, and the child was born <cb /> after six months. Zeus accordingly sewed it up in his thigh till ripe for birth, and then gave it over to Ino, the sister of Semelé. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossathamas">Athamas</ref>.) After her death Hermes took the boy to the nymphs of Mount Nysa, or according to another version, to the Hyades of Dodona, who brought him up and hid him in a cave away from the anger of Heré. It cannot be ascertained where Mount Nysa was originally supposed to be. In later times the name was transferred to many places where the vine was cultivated, not only in Greece, but in Asia, India, and Africa. When grown up, Dionysus is represented as planting the vine, and wandering through the wide world to spread his worship among men, with his wine-flushed train (<foreign lang="greek">θίασος</foreign>) —his nurses and other nymphs, Satyrs, Sileni, and similar woodland deities. Whoever welcomed him kindly, like Icarius in Attica and Oeneus in Aetolia, received the gift of wine; but those who resisted him were terribly punished. A whole series of fables is apparently based upon the tradition that in many places, where a serious religious ritual existed, the dissolute worship of Dionysus met with a vigorous resistance. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslycurgus">Lycurgus</ref>; Minyadae; <ref type="cross" target="crosspentheus">Pentheus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossproetus">Proetus</ref>.</p>
 <p>This worship soon passed from the mainland of Greece to the wine-growing islands, and flourished pre-eminently at Naxos. Here it was, according to the story, that the god wedded <ref type="cross" target="crossariadne">Ariadné</ref> (q.v.). In the islands a fable was current that he fell in with some Tyrrhenian pirates, who took him to their ship and put him in chains. But his fetters fell off, the sails and the mast were wreathed with vine and ivy, the god was changed into a lion, while the seamen threw themselves madly into the sea and were turned into dolphins. In forms akin to this the worship of Dionysus passed into Egypt and far into Asia. Hence arose a fable, founded on the story of Alexander's campaigns, that the god passed victoriously through Egypt, Syria, and India as far as the Ganges, with his army of Sileni, Satyrs, and inspired women, the Maenades or Bacchantes, carrying their wands (<foreign lang="greek">θύρσοι</foreign>) crowned with vines and ivy. Having thus constrained all the world to the recognition of his deity, and having with Heracles, assisted the gods, in the form of a lion, to victory in their war with the Giants, he was taken to Olympus, where, in Homer, he does not appear. From Olympus he descends to the lower world, whence he brings his mother, who is worshipped with him under the name of Thyoné (“the wild one”), as Leto was with Apollo and Artemis. From his mother he is called Thyoneus, a name which, with others of similar meaning, such as Bacchus, Bromios, Euios, and Iacchos, points to a worship founded upon a different conception of his nature.</p>
 <p>In the myth with which we have been hitherto concerned, the god appears mainly in the character and surroundings of joy and triumph. But, as the god of the earth, Dionysus belongs, like Persephoné, to the world below as well as to the world above. The death of vegetation in winter was represented as the flight of the god into hiding from the sentence of his enemies, or even as his extinction; but he returned again from obscurity, or rose from the dead, to new life and activity. In this connection he was called Zagreus (“torn in pieces”) and represented as a son of Zeus and his daughter Persephoné, or sometimes of Zeus and Demeter. In his childhood he was torn to pieces 
<pb n="525" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00525">
<head orig="Dionysus and Lion. (Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.)">Dionysus and Lion. (Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.)</head>
</figure>
 by the Titans, at the command of the jealous Heré. But every third year, after spending the interval in the lower world, he is born anew. According to the Orphic story, Athené brought her son's heart to Zeus, who gave it to Semelé or swallowed it himself, whereupon the Theban or younger Dionysus was born. The grave of Dionysus was shown at Delphi in the inmost shrine of the Temple of Apollo. Secret offerings were brought thither, while the women who were celebrating the feast awakened Licnites; in other words, invoked the new-born god cradled in a winnowing-fan on the neighbouring mountain of Parnassus. Festivals of this kind, in celebration of the extinction and resurrection of the deity, were held by women and girls only, amid the mountains at night, every third year, about the time of the shortest day. The rites, intended to express the excess of grief and joy at the death and reappearance of the god, were wild even to savagery, and the women who performed them were hence known by the expressive names of Bacchae, Maenads, and Thyiades. They wandered through woods and mountains, their flying locks crowned with ivy or snakes, brandishing wands and torches, to the hollow sounds of the drum and the shrill notes of the flute, with wild dances and insane cries and jubilation. The victims of the sacrifice—oxen, goats, even fawns and roes from the forest—were killed, torn in pieces, and eaten raw, in imitation of the treatment of Zagreus by the Titans. Thrace and Macedonia and Asiatic Greece were the scene of the wildest orgies; indeed, Thrace seems to be the country of their birth. In Asiatic Greece, it should be added, the worship of Dionysus-Zagreus came to be associated with the equally wild rites of Rhea (Cybelé) and Atys and Sabus or <ref type="cross" target="crosssabazius">Sabazius</ref> (q.v.). In Greece proper the chief seats of these were Parnassus, with Delphi and its neighbourhood, Boeotia, Argos, and Laconia, and in Boeotia and Laconia especially the mountains Cithaeron and Taÿgetus. They were also known in Naxos, Crete, and other islands. They seem to have been unknown in Attica, though Dionysus was worshipped at the Eleusinian Mysteries, with Persephoné and Demeter, under the name of Iacchos, as brother or bridegroom of Persephoné. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmysteria">Mysteria</ref>.) But the Attic cycle of national festivals in honour of Dionysus represents the idea of the ancient and simple Hellenic worship, with its merry usages. Here Dionysus is the god who gives increase and luxuriance to vineyard and tree. For he is a kindly and gentle power, terrible only to his enemies, <cb /> and born for joy and blessing to mankind. His gifts bring strength and healing to the body, gladness and forgetfulness of care to the mind, whence he was called Lyaeus, or the loosener of care. They are ennobling in their effects, for they require tending, and thus keep men employed in diligent labour; they bring them together in merry meetings, and inspire them to music and poetry. Thus it is to the worship of Dionysus that the dithyramb and the drama owe their origin and development. In this way Dionysus is closely related, not only to Demeter, Aphrodité, Eros, the Graces, and the Muses, but to Apollo, because he inspires men to prophesy.</p>
 <p>The most ancient representation of Dionysus consists of wooden images with the <foreign lang="greek">φαλλός</foreign> (<seg lang="la">membrum virile</seg>) as the symbol of generative power. In works of art he is sometimes represented as the ancient Indian Dionysus, the conqueror of the East. In this character he appears, as in the Vatican statue incorrectly called Sardanapalus, of high stature, with a luxuriant wealth of hair on head and chin. Sometimes again, as in numerous statues which have survived, he is a youth of soft and feminine shape, with a dreamy expression, his long, clustering hair confined by a fillet or crown of ivy, generally naked, or with a fawn or panther skin thrown lightly over him.

Often, too, he is surrounded by the Fauns of his retinue, Maenads, Satyrs, Sileni, Centaurs, etc., or by Nymphs, Muses, Cupids— indeed, in the greatest possible number and variety of situations. Besides the vine, ivy, and rose, the panther, lion, lynx, ox, goat, and dolphin were sacred to him. His usual sacrifices were the ox and the goat.</p>

<head orig="Diophantus">Diophantus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διόφαντος</foreign>). A mathematician of Alexandria, who, according to the most received opinion, was contemporary with the emperor Julian. This opinion is founded upon a passage of Abulfaraj, an Arabian author of the thirteenth century. He names, among the contemporaries of the emperor Julian , Diophantes (for Diophantus) as the author of a celebrated work on algebra and arithmetic; and he is thought to have derived his information from an Arabic commentator on Diophantus, Muhammed al Buziani, who flourished about the end of the eleventh century. The reputation of Diophantus was so great among the ancients that they ranked him with Pythagoras and Euclid. From his epitaph in the Anthology the following particulars of his life have been collected: that he was married when thirty-three years old, and had a son five years after; that the son died at the age of forty-two, and that Diophantes did not survive him above four years; whence it appears that Diophantus was eighty-four years old when he died. Diophantus wrote a work entitled <foreign lang="greek">Ἀριθμητικά</foreign>, in thirteen books, of which only six remain. It would seem that in the fifteenth, and even at the beginning of the seventeenth, century all the thirteen books still existed. The arithmetic of Diophantus is not merely 
<pb n="526" /><cb />
 important for the study of the history of mathematics, but is interesting also to the mathematician himself from its furnishing him with luminous methods for the resolution of analytical problems. We find in it, moreover, the first trace of that branch of the exact sciences called algebra. There exists also a second work of Diophantus, on <title>Polygon Numbers</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Πολυγόνων Ἀριθμῶν</foreign>). He himself cites a third, under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Πορίσματα</foreign>, or <title>Corollaries.</title> A good edition of Diophantus is still that of Fermat <bibl default="NO">(Toulouse, 1670)</bibl>. It is based upon that of Meziriac <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1621)</bibl>, with additions.

Diopithes was impeached by the Macedonian party among the Athenians, but was ably defended by Demosthenes in the oration, still extant, “On the Chersonesus” (B.C. 341), so that he was permitted to retain his command. Subsequently he engaged in a military expedition against Philip, with much spirit and success ( <bibl n="Diod.  16. 75" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvi. 75</bibl>; Aristot. <bibl n="Suet.

<div2 id="crossdioscuri" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dioscūri">Dioscuri</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διόσκουροι</foreign>—i. e. sons of Zeus). The horse-tamer Castor (<foreign lang="greek">Κάστορ</foreign>) and Polydeuces (<foreign lang="greek">Πολυδεύκης</foreign>, Pollux), the master of the art of boxing. In Homer they are represented as the sons of Leda and Tyndareos, and called in consequence Tyndaridae; as dying in the time between the rape of Helen and the Trojan War, and as buried in Lacedaemon. But even under the earth they were alive. Honoured by Zeus, they lived and died on alternate days and enjoyed the prerogatives of godhead. In the later story sometimes both, sometimes only Polydeuces is the descendant of Zeus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossleda">Leda</ref>.) They undertook an expedition to Attica, where they set free their sister Helen whom Theseus had carried off. They took part in the expedition of the <cb /> Argonauts. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossamycus">Amycus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossargonautae">Argonautae</ref>.) Castor, who had been born mortal, fell in a contest with Idas and Lynceus, the sons of their paternal uncle Aphareus. The fight arose, according to one version, in a quarrel over some cattle which they had carried off; according to another, it was about the rape of two daughters of another uncle Leucippus, Phoebé and Hilaïra, who were betrothed to the sons of Aphareus. On his brother's death, Polydeuces, the immortal son of Zeus, prayed his father to let him die, too. Zeus permitted him to spend alternately one day among the gods his peers, the other in the lower world with his beloved brother. According to another story, Zeus, in reward for their brotherly love, set them in the sky as the constellation Gemini, or the morning and evening star. They are the ideal types of bravery and dexterity in fight. Thus they are the tutelary gods of warlike youth, often sharing in their contests, and honoured as the inventors of military dances and melodies. The ancient symbol of the twin gods at Lacedaemon was two parallel beams (<foreign lang="greek">δόκανα</foreign>), joined by cross-pieces, which the Spartans took with them to war. They were worshipped at Sparta and Olympia with Heracles and other heroes. At Athens, too, they were honoured as gods under the name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἄνακες</foreign>. At sea, as in war, they lend their aid to men. The storm-tossed mariner sees the sign of their beneficent presence in the flame at the mast-head ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 3</bibl>). He prays and vows to them the sacrifice of a white lamb, and the storm soon ceases. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshelena">Helena</ref>.) The rites of hospitality are also under their protection. They are generally represented with their horses Xanthus and Cyllarus, as in the celebrated colossal group of the Campidoglio in Rome. Their characteristic emblem is an oval helmet crowned with a star. <figure id="fig.00526">

 <p>The worship of Castor and Pollux was from early times current among the tribes of Italy. They enjoyed especial honours in Tusculum and Rome. In the latter city a considerable temple was built to them near the Forum (B.C. 484) in gratitude for their appearance and assistance at the battle of the Lake Regillus twelve years before. In this building, generally called simply the Temple of Castor, the Senate often held its sittings. It was in their honour, too, that (after B.C. 305) the solemn review of the Roman <seg lang="la">equites</seg> was held on the 15th of July. The names of Castor and Pollux, like that of Hercules, were often in use as familiar expletives, but the name of Castor was invoked by women only (Aul. Gell. xi. 6), since man had caused his death. Both were worshipped as gods of the sea, particularly in Ostia, the harbour town of Rome. Their image is to be seen stamped on the reverse of the oldest Roman silver coins.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Διοσκούρια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Διοσκούρεια</foreign>, <bibl default="NO"><title>C. I. G.</title> 1444</bibl>). Festivals celebrated in various parts of Greece in honour of the Dioscuri, the heroes 
<pb n="527" /><cb /> Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux). The Spartan Dioscuria, mentioned by Pausanias (iv. 27. 1), were celebrated with sacrifices, rejoicings, and drinking. At Cyrené the Dioscuri were likewise honoured with a great festival (Schol. <seg lang="la">ad</seg> <title>Pyth.</title> v. 629). The Athenian festival of the Dioscuri has been mentioned under <ref type="cross" target="crossanakeia">Anakeia</ref>, where they were worshipped under the name of <foreign lang="greek">Ἄνακες</foreign>. Their worship was very generally adopted in Greece, especially in the Doric and Achaean States (Pausan. x. 33, 3; 38, 3), as we conclude from the great number of temples dedicated to them; but scarcely anything is known respecting the manner in which their festivals were celebrated.</p>
 <p>The festival of the Dioscuri was celebrated at Rome with great splendour on the Ides of Quinctilis, the 15th of July, the day on which they were believed to have assisted the Romans against the Latins in the battle of the Lake Regillus. On this occasion the <seg lang="la">equites</seg>, who regarded the Dioscuri as their patrons, went in a magnificent procession, crowned with olive chaplets and wearing their state dress, the trabea, from the Temple of Mars outside the city, through the main streets, across the Forum, and by the ancient temple of the Dioscuri ( <bibl n="Dionys.  6. 13" default="NO">Dionys.vi. 13</bibl>).

<head orig="Dithyrambus">Dithyrambus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">διθύραμβος</foreign>). A hymn sung at the festivals of Dionysus to the accompaniment of a flute and a dance round the altar. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>.) The hymn celebrated the sufferings and actions of the god in a style corresponding to the passionate character of his worship. In the course of time it developed into a distinct kind of Greek lyric poetry. It was in Corinth that it first received anything like a definite artistic form, and this at the hands of Arion , who was therefore credited by the ancients with its actual invention. The truth probably is that he was the first who divided the festal song of the chorus into strophe and antistrophe, and arrangement from which tragedy took its rise. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstragoedia">Tragoedia</ref>.) Dithyrambs were sung at Athens twice in the year—at the Great Dionysia in the spring and at the Lenaea in the beginning of winter. The chorus consisted of fifty persons, who stood in a circle round the altar. The dithyramb was further developed by Lasus of Hermioné, the lyric poet and musician who lived about B.C. 520 at the court of the Pisistratidae. By several innovations in music and rhythm, especially by a stronger and more complete instrumentation, this artist gave it greater variety and a more secular character. He also introduced the prize contests 
<pb n="529" /><cb />
 for the best dithyramb, and apparently abolished the antistrophical division; at least this is not found in the dithyrambs of his pupil Pindar. With Lasus and Pindar, Simonides and Bacchylides may be named as among the foremost dithyrambic poets of their time. At the dithyrambic contests the poets of the different tribes contended for the prize. Each had its chorus, brilliantly fitted out at great expense by the richer citizens. Besides the honour of the victory the poet received a tripod; the chorus, and the people which it represented, an ox for the sacrificial feast. These performances were very popular for a long time; but, as the new tendency developed itself, voices of authority made themselves heard, condemning them as involving a serious degeneracy in art. There is, in fact, no doubt that in the form which it assumed after the time of the Peloponnesian War the dithyramb did violence to the older taste. More and more it lost the inner unity and beautiful proportion which that feeling required. A continuous and rapid change of rhythm and mode was accompanied by an extraordinary boldness of diction, in keeping with the wild character of the composition. In the hands of inferior poets this often passed into turgidity and bombast, if not into mere nonsense. Solo pieces were inserted to relieve the choruses, the text was gradually subordinated to the music, and the dithyramb was thus gradually transformed into a kind of opera. Though the subjects of the poems had long ceased to be taken exclusively from the cycle of Dionysiac myths, they were never, of course, entirely out of harmony with the lyrical spirit of the dithyramb.</p>
 <p>There was a very considerable number of dithyrambic poets. The best known are <ref type="cross" target="crossmelanippides">Melanippides</ref> (q.v.) of Melos (about B.C. 415), who is generally held responsible for the degeneracy of the dithyramb and the excess of instrumental music; his disciple Philoxenus of Cythera, who died in 380; Timotheus of Miletus, who died in 357, and his contemporaries Polyidus and Telestes.

 <p> (prevision of the future). (1) In general the word is applied to all prophecy or foretelling in the simplest sense of the word. Among the Romans, prophecy was based, not on inspiration, as with the Greeks, but on the observation of definite signs, such as the <seg lang="la">omen</seg> (or voice), the prodigies and the auspices taken note of by the augurs. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugur">Augur</ref>.) The science of the <seg lang="la">haruspices</seg> (or the foretelling of events from the inspection of the carcases of sacrificial victims) was a later importation from Etruria. The ancient Romans were not familiar with the divinatio from <seg lang="la">sortes</seg> or lots, which was common in many parts of Italy. The Sibylline Books threw no light on future events. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssibyllae">Sibylla</ref>.) Towards the end of the republican period the sciences of the augurs and haruspices lost their significance, and the Greek oracles, in the various forms of their craft, with the Chaldaean astrology, came into vogue, and carried the fashion in the society of the Empire. On divination among the Greeks see <ref type="cross" target="crossmantike">Mantiké</ref>.

 <p>(2) In the language of Roman law, <seg lang="la">divinatio</seg> meant the legal inquiry for deciding who, among many advocates proposing themselves, was the fittest to undertake a prosecution, and also the speeches by which the various advocates tried to make good their competency for the task. Thus Cicero's oration called <title>Divinatio in Caecilium</title> was pronounced by him against Q. Caecilius Niger, a sham accuser of Verres, who claimed the right to prosecute, but who would have played into the hands of the accused.

 <p> Divorce. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The term for this act was <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόλειψις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόπεμψις</foreign>, the former denoting the act of a wife leaving her husband, and the latter that of a husband dismissing his wife (Demosth. <title>c. Onet.</title> i. p. 865. 4; <title>c. Neaer.</title> p. 1362. 52, 1365. 59). The only Greek States respecting whose laws of divorce we have any knowledge are Athens and Sparta. In both States the law permitted either husband or wife to call for and effect a divorce, though it was much easier for a husband to get rid of his wife than for a wife to escape from her husband. At Sparta, it seems, a man might dismiss his wife if she bore him no issue; the recorded instances, however, are those of kings, and private inclination was sacrificed to State policy ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 39" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 39</bibl>; vi. 61). The law at Athens allowed a man to divorce his wife without ceremony, simply by his act of sending her out of his house (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκπέμπειν, ἀποπέμπειν</foreign>), upon which she returned to the guardianship of her nearest male relation. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosskyrios">Kyrios</ref>.) The husband was then bound to return the dowry which she had brought him, or 
<pb n="530" /><cb />
 to pay her interest at the rate of nine obols per mina per month—18 per cent. per annum; and in addition to this to provide alimony (<foreign lang="greek">σῖτος</foreign>). A husband thus dismissing his wife usually did so, as might be expected, in the presence of witnesses ( <title>c. Alcib.</title> i. 28). What became of the children in such a case is not mentioned, but it is probable that they remained with the father. Adultery on the part of the wife compelled her husband to divorce her, or himself incur the penalty of atimia (Lex <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Demosth. <title>c. Neaer.</title> p. 1374. 87). When, on the other hand, a wife wished to leave her husband, if both parties agreed upon a divorce no further proceedings were required: mutual consent was sufficient to dissolve a marriage. If the husband objected, she was obliged to appear in person before the archon, and state in writing the grounds of her application ( <title>Alcib.</title> 12). She had to conduct her case quite alone, for, as she was in her husband's power until judgment was given, no one had a right to come forward as her advocate. It has been maintained that she could be represented by her <foreign lang="greek">κύριος</foreign>, but the notorious case of Alcibiades and his ill-used wife Hippareté, in the passage just cited, leaves little doubt that she could not. The action thus brought by a woman was called <foreign lang="greek">ἀπολείψεως δίκη</foreign>. Her right to a separation would depend on the treatment she had received (see <ref type="cross" target="crosskakosis">Kakosis</ref>); but of the nature of the archon's jurisdiction we know but little. The husband's loss of freedom (i. e. by becoming a prisoner of war and being sold into slavery) is mentioned as affording an absolute claim to a divorce.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The word <seg lang="la">divortium</seg> signified generally a separation; and, in a special sense, a divorce or dissolution of marriage. Several authorities ( <bibl n="Gel.  4. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iv. 3</bibl>; <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 25" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 25</bibl>) state that divorce was unknown at Rome in early times, and that the first instance of divorce occurred in B.C. 233, when Sp. Carvilius Ruga put away his wife on the ground of barrenness. It is said that the act of Carvilius was generally disapproved of (Val. Max. ii. 1-4). It is probable that divorce on account of the misconduct of the wife was in use from a very early period; but the case of Carvilius Ruga may have been the beginning of the lax system of divorce which prevailed towards the end of the free Republic and under the Empire.</p>
 <p>The marriage by which the husband acquired <seg lang="la">manus</seg> over his wife, as well as the later free marriage, was dissoluble; but the marriage of a <seg lang="la">flamen</seg>, which was solemnized by <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg>, could never under any circumstances be severed. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmatrimonium">Matrimonium</ref>.</p>
 <p>A corresponding form to that by which a marriage had been created was used for dissolving it: thus a marriage entered into by <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg> was put an end to by a similar ceremony, called <seg lang="la">diffarreatio</seg> (Festus, s. v. <hi rend="italic">diffarr.</hi>). If a wife had passed into the <seg lang="la">manus</seg> of her husband by <seg lang="la">coemptio</seg>, she could only be released by a <hi rend="italic">remancipatio</hi>, which, according to Gaius , the husband could be compelled to execute (i. 137). These formal restrictions on the right of divorce disappeared under the free form of marriage, which did not bring the wife <seg lang="la">in manum viri.</seg> The theory on which Roman marriage was based admitted the utmost facility of divorce: the consent and conjugal affection of the parties were regarded as the essential part of a marriage, and this <seg lang="la">affectio maritalis</seg> was necessary for the continuance as well as for <cb /> the creation of a marriage. Accordingly, either party might declare his or her consent to dissolve the connection. No judicial decree and no interference of any public authority was necessary to dissolve the marriage. A divorce which was brought about by one party renouncing the marriage and not by mutual consent was called a <seg lang="la">repudium.</seg> It was customary for one who renounced a marriage to send a distinct notice or declaration of intention to the other party, and it was doubted in the time of Cicero whether the simple fact of either party marrying again without any such notice having been given was sufficient to constitute a divorce ( <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 1. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Orat.</title>i. 40</bibl>). The ceremony of breaking the <seg lang="la">nuptiales tabulae</seg>, or of taking the keys of the house from the woman and turning her out of doors, was probably considered to be an act of itself significant enough; but the general practice was apparently to deliver a written notice, and perhaps to assign a reason. By the Lex Iulia <seg lang="la">de adulteriis</seg> it was required that a <seg lang="la">repudium</seg> should be executed in the presence of seven witnesses, Roman citizens of the age of puberty (<title>Dig.</title> xxiv. 2, 9). This prevented an adulteress from setting up the pretence of a <seg lang="la">repudium</seg> as an excuse for her conduct. See <ref type="cross" target="crossadulterium">Adulterium</ref>.</p>
 <p>Not only the wife herself, but also her father, if she was under his power, might dissolve the marriage. This right of a paterfamilias was made practically ineffectual by a decree of the emperor Marcus. Towards the latter part of the Republic and under the Empire, divorces became very common. Cn. Pompeius divorced his wife Mucia for alleged adultery, and his conduct was approved ( <title>Ad Att.</title> i. 12, 18); and Cicero speaks (<title>Ad Fam.</title> viii. 7) of Paulla Valeria as being ready to serve her husband on his return from his province with notice of divorce. Cicero himself divorced his wife Terentia after living with her for thirty years, and married a young woman whom he also divorced. Cato the Younger divorced his wife Marcia, that his friend Hortensius might marry her and have children by her; for this is the true meaning of the story ( <title>Cat. Min.</title> 25). Maecenas put away his wife Terentia so often that the Roman wits said that he had been a hundred times married, and always to the same woman; Sempronius Sophus divorced his wife because she had once been to the public games without his knowledge. Seneca declared that there were women at Rome who reckoned the years by their husbands rather than by the consuls. Juvenal mentions one who had had eight husbands in five years; and Tertullian sums up the prevailing practices epigrammatically in the sentence, “The fruit of marriage is divorce” ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>6</bibl>). By the Lex Papia Poppaea a freedwoman who had married her patron was prevented from divorcing herself (<title>Dig.</title> xxiv. 2, 11) so as to be capable of marrying any one else. From an early time penalties were imposed on those who divorced without good cause, and also on those who by their conduct made a divorce necessary.</p>
 <p>A man was punished by <seg lang="la">nota censoria</seg>, a woman by loss of <seg lang="la">dos</seg> (q. v.). There was the <seg lang="la">retentio dotis propter mores</seg> when the divorce was caused by the fault of the wife, and also the <seg lang="la">retentio propter liberos</seg> which was the right of the husband to deduct an additional amount of <seg lang="la">dos</seg> in case there were children of the marriage. The free right of divorce was not taken away by the early Christian emperors, but its exercise except on grounds de 
<pb n="531" /><cb />
 fined by statute was severely punished. Justinian went further than his predecessors in limiting the legal grounds of divorce. He even punished divorce by mutual consent unless the object of the parties was to live a life of chastity (<title>Dig.</title> 34, 2; <title>Cod. Theod.</title> iii. 16; <title>Cod.</title> v. 17).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ δόκανα</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">δοκός</foreign>, “a beam”). An ancient symbolical representation of the Dioscuri (Castor and Polydeuces) at Sparta. It consisted of two upright beams with others laid across them transversely ( <title>De Amor. Fratr.</title>). This rude symbol of fraternal unity evidently points to a very remote age, in which scarcely any attempts in sculpture can have been made. At a later time, when works of art were introduced into all the spheres of ordinary life, this rude and ancient object of worship, like many others of its kind, was not superseded by a more appropriate symbol. The Dioscuri were worshipped as gods of war, and we know that their images accompanied the Spartan kings whenever they took the field against an enemy. But when in the year B.C. 504 the two kings, during their invasion of Attica, failed in their undertaking on account of their secret enmity towards each other, it was decreed at Sparta that in future only one king should command the army, and in consequence should be accompanied by only one of the images of the Dioscuri ( <bibl n="Hdt.  v" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  75" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 75</bibl>). It is not improbable that these images, accompanying the kings into the field, were the ancient <foreign lang="greek">δόκανα</foreign>, which were now disjointed, so that one half of the symbol remained at Sparta, while the other was taken into the field by one of the kings.

<head orig="Dokimasia">Dokimasia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δοκιμασία</foreign>). The name used at Athens to denote the process of ascertaining the capacity of the citizens for the exercise of public rights and duties. If, for instance, a young citizen was to be admitted among the <ref type="cross" target="crossephebi">Ephebi</ref> (q.v.), he was examined in an assembly of his district to find out whether he was descended on both sides from Athenian citizens, and whether he possessed the physical capacity for military service. All officials, <cb /> too—even the members of the Senate—had to submit to an examination before entering upon their office. The purpose of this was to ascertain, not their actual capacity for the post, which was presupposed in all candidates, but their descent from Athenian citizens, their life and character, and (in the case of some offices which involved the administration of large sums) even the amount of their property. The examination was carried on in public by the archons in the presence of the Senate, and any one present had the right to raise objections. If such objections were held to be valid the candidate was rejected; but he had the right to appeal to the decision of a court, which would take cognizance of the matter in judicial form. On the other hand, if he were accepted, any one who thought his claims insufficient had the right of instituting judicial proceedings against him. If the decision was adverse he would lose his office, and was further liable to punishment varying according to the offence charged against him—which might be, for instance, that of unlawfully assuming the rights of a citizen. A speaker in a public assembly might thus be brought before a court by any citizen, for no one not possessed of the full right of citizenship could legally address the people. The question might thus be raised whether the orator were not actually <hi rend="italic">atimos</hi>, or guilty of an offence which involved <hi rend="italic">atimia</hi> (q. v.).

 <p>Döderlein was fully as remarkable as a teacher as for his scholarship, and appears to have made upon his hearers a profound and ineffaceable impression. To great acuteness and unfailing tact he added an enthusiasm, energy, and vigour that 
<pb n="532" /><cb />
 carried at once himself and his hearers away. Thoroughly imbued with the very genius of antiquity, the great masters of classical literature were to him not subjects of study but, as he himself called them, “intimate and cherished friends,” and into all who listened to him he inspired much of his own passionate zeal. An untiring worker, rising every morning soon after midnight to pursue his researches, he left behind him both in his works and in the memories of his pupils the figure of a great and impressive personality.

<head orig="Dodōna">Dodona</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δωδώνη</foreign>). (1) A celebrated city and oracle of Epirus, whose exact position has only of late been ascertained. We are not assisted here by any accurate ancient traveller like Pausanias, nor have we any itineraries or faithful measurements of distances to guide us; all is vague and indefinite. Dionysius of Halicarnassus placed it four days' journey from Buthrotum and two from Ambracia (<title>Antiq. Rom.</title> i. 5). It is universally allowed that the temple of Dodona owed its origin to the Pelasgi at a period much anterior to the Trojan War; since many writers represent it as existing in the time of Deucalion, and even of Inachus ( <title>Prom. Vinct.</title> 679). Herodotus distinctly states that it was the most ancient oracle of Greece, and represents the Pelasgi as consulting it on various occasions (ii. 52). Hence the title of “Pelasgic” assigned to Zeus, to whom the temple was dedicated (<title>Iliad</title>, xvi. 233). Of the existence, however, of another oracle in Thessaly of the same name no doubt can be entertained; and to this the prayer of Achilles, in Homer, probably had reference. Setting aside the fables which Herodotus has transmitted to us, and to which he evidently attached no belief, his report of the affinity which existed between the service of this temple and that of Thebes in Egypt is deserving of attention. It appears from this author that in his time the service of the temple was performed by women; and he has recorded the names of the three priestesses who officiated when he visited Dodona (ii. 55). Strabo, however, asserts that these duties were originally allotted to men, from the circumstance of Homer's mention of the Selli as being attendant upon the gods. The term Selli was considered by many ancient writers to refer to a people of Pelasgic origin ( <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 1160" default="NO" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Trach.</title> 1160</bibl> foll.; Aristot. <title>Meteorol.</title> 1, 14).</p>
 <p>The responses of the oracle were originally delivered from the sacred oak or beech (<foreign lang="greek">φηγός</foreign>) (<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 173" default="NO" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Trach.</title> 173</bibl>). The god revealed his message in the rustling of the leaves, and the priests interpreted its meaning. Its reputation was at first confined to the inhabitants of Epirus, Acarnania, Aetolia, and the western parts of Greece (Pausan. vii. 21), but its fame was afterwards extended over the whole of that country, and even to Asia, as we know that on one occasion the oracle was consulted by Croesus ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 46</bibl>). The Boeotians were the only people who received the prophetic answers from the mouth of men; to all other nations they were always communicated by the priestesses of the temple. The reason of this exception is stated at length by Strabo (401), on the authority of Ephorus. Dodona was the first station in Greece to which the offerings of the Hyperboreans were despatched, according to Herodotus; they arrived there from the Adriatic, and were thence passed on to the Maliac Gulf (iv. 33). Among the several offerings presented to the temple by various nations, <cb /> one dedicated by the Corcyreans is particularly noticed. It was a brazen figure placed over a caldron of the same metal; this statue held in its hand a whip, the lash of which consisted of three chains, each having an astragalus fastened to the end of it; these, when agitated by the wind, struck the caldron and produced so continued a sound that 400 vibrations could be counted before it ceased. Hence arose the various proverbs of the Dodonean caldron and the Corcyrean lash. Menander, in one of his plays, compared an old nurse's chatter to the endless sound of this kettle (<title>Menand. Reliq. ed.</title> Meineke, p. 27). See <ref type="cross" target="crossoracula">Oracula</ref>.</p>
 <p>We hear of the oracle of Dodona at the time of the Persian invasion ( <bibl n="Hdt.  9. 93" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.ix. 93</bibl>); and again in the reign of Agesilaüs, who consulted it previously to his expedition into Asia. It is stated by Diodorus Siculus (xiv. 13) that Lysander was accused openly of having offered to bribe the priestess. The oracle which warned the Molossian Alexander of his fate is well known from Livy (viii. 24). From Demosthenes we learn that the answers delivered from time to time to the Athenians were laid up in the public archives, and he himself appeals to their testimony on more than one occasion. At length, during the Social War, Dodona was, according to Polybius (iv. 67), almost entirely destroyed in an irruption of the Aetolians, under their leader Dorimachus, then at war with Epirus. It is probable that the temple of Dodona never recovered from this disaster, as in Strabo's time there was scarcely any trace left of the oracle, but the town must still have existed, as it is mentioned by Hierocles among the cities of Epirus in the seventh century, and we hear of a bishop of Dodona in the council of Ephesus. All accounts seem to agree that Dodona stood either on the declivity or at the foot of an elevated mountain called Tomarus or Tamarus. Hence the term Tomuri, supposed to be a contraction for Tomaruri (<foreign lang="greek">Τομαρούροι</foreign>), or guardians of Tomarus, which was given to the priests of the temple. The site of Dodona was at one time supposed to be near Janina in Epirus, but recent explorations in the valley of Dramisius at the foot of Mount Olytzika have brought to light many dedicatory inscriptions to Zeus Naïos and Dioné, with other evidences that make this the probable site of the oracle.

<div2 id="crossdomicilium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Domicilium">Domicilium</head>

 <p> A term of Roman law, signifying a man's permanent home. The following is the well-known definition of <seg lang="la">domicilium</seg> given in the <title>Corpus Iuris</title> (<title>Cod.</title> x. 40, 7): “In eo loco singulos habere domicilium non ambigitur, ubi quis larem rerumque ac fortunarum suarum summam constituit, unde rursus non sit discessurus, si nihil avocet, unde cum profectus est peregrinari videtur, quo si rediit peregrinari iam destitit.” In a passage of the <title>Digest</title> a man's home is thus defined (<title>Dig.</title> 1. 16, 203): “Sed de ea re constitutum esse (respondit) eam domum unicuique nostrum debere 
<pb n="534" /><cb />
 existimari, ubi quisque sedes et tabulas haberet suarumque rerum constitutionem fecisset.” A man acquired domicilium by making a place his residence and intending to remain in it permanently (<seg lang="la">animus manendi</seg>). Domicilium was lost by abandonment, and the question of the existence of domicile was treated as one of fact to be determined by the circumstances of each case.</p>
 <p>The conception of domicile has far more important consequences in modern systems of law than in ancient; it is the foundation of a branch of what is sometimes called private international law, but more correctly the conflict of laws.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossdominium" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Dominium">Dominium</head>

 <p> <title>Dominium</title> or <seg lang="la">rerum dominium</seg> signifies ownership of property, and <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> is the owner. <title>Proprietas</title> is frequently used as an equivalent to <seg lang="la">dominium;</seg> and when ownership is distinguished from <seg lang="la">usus fructus</seg>, the word <seg lang="la">proprietas</seg> is preferred to <seg lang="la">dominium</seg> as an expression for ownership. The term <seg lang="la">dominium</seg> or <seg lang="la">dominium legitimum</seg> is, strictly speaking, confined to ownership <title>ex iure Quiritium</title>—i. e. to civil ownership—and does not include ownership <seg lang="la">in bonis</seg>—i. e. praetorian ownership.</p>
 <p>Ownership is not defined by Roman legal writers, but the general notion implied in the term is clear. It is a right which, subject to certain legal limitations, entitles a person to exercise full control over a corporeal thing to the exclusion of all other persons. Ownership cannot, however, be defined by enumerating all the powers which may be incidental to it, as the <seg lang="la">ius utendi, fruendi, possidendi, disponendi</seg>, since ownership may exist notwithstanding that one or more of these powers is detached from it. A thing may be considered to belong to a person whose powers over it are very much curtailed; hence arises the difficulty of defining ownership. The limitations to which ownership in Roman law is subject are either general or special. The former are imposed for the purpose of enforcing the precept <seg lang="la">sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas:</seg> they prevent owners from so using their powers as to injure adjoining owners or the public generally. Special limitations on ownership arise by persons acquiring rights over property owned by some one else. For instance, the owner may be bound to allow to another person a certain use or enjoyment of the thing of which he is <seg lang="la">dominus</seg>, or to abstain from doing certain acts on or to his property and for the benefit of some other person. The only rights of this kind recognized by Roman law are <seg lang="la">servitus, emphyteusis, superficies, pignus:</seg> such rights are called <seg lang="la">iura in re aliena;</seg> they are protected, like <seg lang="la">dominium</seg>, by actions <seg lang="la">in rem:</seg> their nature is more fully explained under the head of <ref type="cross" target="crossservitus">Servitus</ref>. Ownership is in its nature single and entire; consequently the same thing cannot belong to several separate owners, but several persons may be joint <seg lang="la">domini</seg> or owners of one thing.
 </p></div2>
 
<div2 id="crossdominus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Domĭnus">Dominus</head>

 <p> A master, owner. The word was applied as a title of respect to a superior in rank or station. Thus the head of a family was sometimes called <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> by the free members of his family as well as by his slaves. The title of <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> came to be ascribed to the emperor. The history of this use of the word, which corresponds with changes in the character of the emperor, is briefly as follows: Augustus refused to be called <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>53</bibl>, with Peck's note), as did <cb /> also Tiberius ( <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>27</bibl>); and Caligula was the first emperor who allowed himself to be addressed by the title (Victor. <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 3" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>3</bibl>). Domitian claimed the titles of <title>Deus et Dominus</title> (Dio Cass. lxii. 13). Trajan only wished to be called <seg lang="la">princeps</seg> ( <title>Paneg.</title> 2, 63, 88). Pliny in his letters always addresses Trajan as <seg lang="la">dominus</seg>, but in doing so he does not intend to make use of an official title. <title>Dominus</title> first appears on imperial monuments in the reign of Septimius Severus. Aurelian first adopted the title <title>Deus et Dominus</title> on his coins. Diocletian allowed himself to be publicly addressed as <seg lang="la">dominus.</seg> From the fourth century the emperors freely ascribe the title to themselves. The reason why the earlier emperors objected to being styled <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> is to be found in the fact that they still kept up a pretence of republican equality. Now the word <seg lang="la">dominus</seg> to a Roman, like <foreign lang="greek">δεσπότης</foreign> to a Greek, means a master in relation to slaves, or (politically) a tyrant, the possessor of arbitrary power (Sall. <title>Iug.</title> 85). Later, when the imperial power had become hedged about by precedent and tradition, the emperor willingly accepted the title as his due.</p>
 <p>The word <seg lang="la">dominus</seg>, besides retaining its full force as a term of great dignity, underwent a further development as a social title. In Suet. <title>Claud.</title> 21, it is applied by the emperor to his plebeian guests as an ordinary title of courtesy. In Mart. vi. 88, it is equivalent to “Mister.” It is used by Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Am. 3. 7. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Am.</title>iii. 7. 11</bibl>) as a term of affection. In the modern languages it has developed through the Low Latin forms <hi rend="italic">domnus, domna, donnus, dominicella</hi> into the Portuguese <hi rend="italic">dom</hi>, Span. <seg lang="la">don, doña</seg>, Fr. <hi rend="italic">dame, madame (mea domna), demoiselle</hi>, and Old English <hi rend="italic">dan.</hi> See Peck's note to  <bibl n="Suet.

 <p>The second son of Vespasian, born at Rome A.D. 51. Vespasian, well aware of his natural disposition, reposed no confidence in him during his whole reign. Domitian, however, accompanied his father and his brother Titus in their triumph at the close of the Jewish War. Upon the death of Vespasian he 
<pb n="535" /><cb />
 endeavoured to foment troubles in the Empire and share the succession with Titus. The latter, however, forgave him, treated him with great kindness, and made him his colleague in the consulship, always declaring to him that he intended him for his successor. Domitian is accused of hastening the death of Titus by poison—a charge, however, not warranted by the circumstances of Titus's death. The beginning of his reign was marked by moderation and a display of justice bordering upon severity. His affected great zeal for the reformation of public morals, and punished with death several persons guilty of adultery as well as some vestals who had broken their vows. He completed several splendid buildings begun by Titus—among others an <seg lang="la">odeum</seg>, or theatre for musical performances. The most important event of his reign was the conquest of Britain by Agricola, but Domitian grew jealous of that great commander's reputation and recalled him to Rome. His suspicious temper and his pusillanimity made him afraid of every man who was distinguished either by birth and connections or by merit and popularity, and he mercilessly sacrificed many to his fears, while his avarice led him to put to death a number of wealthy persons for the sake of their property. The usual pretext for these murders was the charge of conspiracy or treason, and thus a numerous race of informers was created and maintained by this system of spoliation. His cruelty was united to a deep dissimulation, and in this particular he resembled Tiberius rather than Caligula or Nero. He either put to death or drove away from Rome the philosophers and men of letters; Epictetus was one of the exiled. He found, however, some flatterers among the poets, such as Martial, Silius Italicus, and Statius. The latter dedicated to him his <title>Thebaïs</title> and <title>Achilleïs</title> and commemorated the events of his reign in his <title>Silvae.</title> But, in reality, the reign of Domitian was other than favourable to the Roman arms, except in Britain. In Moesia and Dacia, in Germany and Pannonia, his armies were defeated and whole provinces lost ( <title>Agric.</title> <figure id="fig.00535">
<head orig="Domitian. (Cameo in Paris.)">Domitian. (Cameo in Paris.)</head>
</figure> 41). Domitian himself went twice into Moesia to oppose the Dacians, but, after several defeats, concluded a disgraceful peace with their king Decebalus, whom he acknowledged as sovereign, and to whom he agreed to pay tribute, which was afterwards discontinued by Trajan. Yet Domitian made a pompous report of his victories to the Senate and assumed the honours of a triumph. In the same manner he triumphed over the Cotti and the Sarmatians, which made Pliny the Younger say that the triumphs of Domitian were always evidence of some advantages gained by the enemies of Rome. In A.D. 95, Domitian assumed the consulship for the seventeenth time, together with Flavius Clemens, who had married Domitilla, a relative of the emperor. <cb /> In that year a persecution of the Christians is recorded in the history of the Church, but it seems that it was not directed particularly against them, but against the Jews, with whom the Christians were often confounded by the Romans. Flavius Clemens and his wife were among the victims. In the following year, A.D. 96, a conspiracy was formed against Domitian among the officers of his guards and several of his intimate friends, and his wife, the infamous Domitilla, herself is said to have participated in it. The immediate cause of it was his increasing suspicion, which threatened the life of every one around him, and which is said to have been stimulated by the predictions of astrologers and soothsayers, whom he was very ready to consult. He was killed in his apartments by several of the conspirators, after struggling with them for some time, in his forty-fifth year and in the fifteenth of his reign. On the news of his death the Senate assembled and elected M. Cocceius Nerva emperor.</p>
 <p>The character of Domitian is represented by all ancient historians in the darkest colours, as being a compound of timidity and cruelty, of dissimulation and arrogance, of self-indulgence and stern severity towards others. He gave himself up to every excess and plunged into the most degrading vices. Conceiving at last the idea of arrogating divine honours to himself, he assumed the titles of Lord and God and claimed to be a son of Minerva. Soon after he had succeeded to the government he indulged in that love of solitude which pride and fear combined to render in a very short time the most confirmed of all his habits. In the beginning of his reign, says his biographer, he accustomed himself to spend several hours every day in the strictest privacy, employed frequently in nothing else than in catching flies and piercing them with a sharp instrument. Hence the well-known remark made by Vibius Crispus, who, when asked whether there was any one with the emperor, replied, “No, not even a fly.” Domitian took a delight in inspiring others with terror, and Dio Cassius tells of a singular banquet, to which he invited the principal members of the Senate and equestrian order, where everything wore the appearance of an intended execution. He once even convened the Senate to determine in what way a large turbot should be cooked, whether whole or divided ( <bibl n="Juv.  4." default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iv.</bibl>). The Senate, after his death, issued a decree that his name should be struck out of the Roman annals and obliterated from every public monument. His career is sketched in detail by Imhoff <bibl default="NO">(1857)</bibl>.

 <p>A native of Emesa, of low birth, but married to the Roman emperor Septimius Severus (A.D. 175), by whom she had Caracalla and Geta. She was a woman of much intellectual power and both political and literary ability, having great influence over her husband, after whose death she was intrusted by Caracalla with the conduct of state business of the first importance. When Caracalla was put to death by Macrinus (A.D. 217) she was at first treated with much consideration; but having excited the suspicion of Macrinus, she was banished from Antioch, and soon after ended her own life by voluntary starvation <figure id="fig.00536">
<head orig="Iulia Pia Domna. (Vatican Museum.)">Iulia Pia Domna. (Vatican Museum.)</head>
</figure> (A.D. 217). She is described as a woman of much beauty but of loose morals; and is accused by Spartianus, Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, and Orosius of having maintained an incestuous intercourse with Caracalla, so that she was popularly known at Alexandria as “Iocasta.” Dio Cassius, however, her contemporary, does not mention this scandalous story. Iulia was the great-aunt of Elagabalus and of Alexander Severus.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">οἰκία, οἴκησις, οἰκητήριον</foreign>, a dwellinghouse; <foreign lang="greek">οἶκος</foreign>, generally a room; in Homer and the tragedians, <foreign lang="greek">δόμος</foreign>, but more usually in the plural as a dwelling-house). A house.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. Pre-historic</hi>.—One special form of hut appears to have been commonly used by many different races of men at an early stage of their development. This was a small circular structure made of branches of trees stuck into the ground in a circle, and then bent inwards till their ends met and were tied together at the top. This rude frame-work was then filled in by wattled work woven in and out, and the whole was daubed over with tempered mud or clay. The hut of Achilles, thatched with rushes ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24. 450" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiv. 450</bibl>), was probably a dwelling of this sort.</p>
 <p>In historic times a survival of this ancient circular form of house existed in the form of the Prytaneum in Athens and elsewhere, and also in the <cb /> Athenian <foreign lang="greek">Θόλος</foreign>, which was built in the newer part of Athens as an adjunct, in a more convenient position for the use of the Prytanes. The Tholus was a round building with a conical roof, and must have had some resemblance to the Roman Temple of Vesta, to which the same name was frequently applied. The original Temple of Vesta was a round hut formed with wattle-work of osiers (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 261" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 261</bibl> foll.; Fest. p. 250 M.).</p>
 <p>Even during the imperial period in Rome one or more wattled huts were preserved in memory of the primitive dwellings of its founders. One of these, which stood at the western angle of the Palatine Hill, was known as the <title>Casa Romuli</title> ( <bibl n="Dionys.  1. 79" default="NO">Dionys.i. 79</bibl>); it was twice burned and repaired during the reign of Augustus (Dio Cass. xlviii. 43, and liv. 29). The Tugurium Faustuli is probably another name for the same thing. Another hut, also called after Romulus, appears to have been <figure id="fig.00536.2">
<head orig="Casa Romuli.">Casa Romuli.</head>
</figure> preserved on the Capitoline Hill (Vitruv. ii. 1; <title>Contr.</title> i. 6).</p>
 <p>A careful representation of this early form of house, as used by the prehistoric Latin race, exists in the small sepulchral “houseurns,” which are found in considerable numbers in the early cemeteries of central Italy and elsewhere. These curious pieces of archaic pottery have small movable doors fixed with a wooden peg. See Virchow, <bibl default="NO"><title>Die italienischen und deutschen Haus-Urnen</title> (Berlin, 1884)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>During the many centuries which elapsed before the commencement of the historic period of Greece, a state of society existed very different from that with which Greek literature has made us familiar. Instead of large cities, a number of small, highly fortified towns or villages were ruled in an autocratic way by some chieftain of semi-Oriental habits, who lived in a style of much luxury and splendour, surrounded by a group of followers, very much like those of a mediaeval feudal lord. At this early period wealth and splendour, which in historic times were devoted to the more public uses of the agora, the council chamber, and the temples of the gods, were lavished on the palace of the chief. It is this period that is celebrated in the Homeric poems which, there is every reason to believe, give us a faithful, if highly coloured, picture of the magnificence which adorned the dwellings of wealthy chiefs, such as Alcinoüs and, in a lesser degree, Odysseus. The recent discoveries made by Dr. Schliemann and Dr. Dörpfeld, within the massive walls of Tiryns (the <foreign lang="greek">Τίρυνς τειχιόεσσα</foreign> of Homer), have for the first time shown us that the stately and richly decorated palaces of the <title>Odyssey</title> were not wholly the offspring of a poet's fancy. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstiryns">Tiryns</ref>.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. The Homeric Palace of Odysseus</hi>.—The palace of Odysseus, as depicted in the <title>Odyssey</title>, may be taken as representing the Homeric house. It has been most clearly described by Prof. Gardner, of whose valuable paper in the <bibl default="NO"><title>Quarterly Review</title> (January, 1886)</bibl> what follows under this head is practically a summary.</p>
 <p>The Homeric house consisted of three parts: 
<pb n="537" /><cb /></p>
 <p><foreign lang="greek">αὐλή</foreign>, the fore-court; <foreign lang="greek">δῶμα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign>, the hall of the men; and <foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος</foreign>, called in later times <foreign lang="greek">γυναικωνῖτις</foreign>, the apartments of the women. The house was entered by massive folding-doors (<foreign lang="greek">θύραι δικλίδες</foreign>), and on either side were stone seats (<foreign lang="greek">ἑδραι</foreign>). The doors led into the <foreign lang="greek">αὐλή</foreign>, or open court-yard, which was used as a kind of farm-yard. On either side and behind were chambers (<foreign lang="greek">θάλαμοι</foreign>) used for various purposes, such as grinding the corn ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 20. 105" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xx. 105</bibl>), and sometimes for sleeping in ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 19. 48" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xix. 48</bibl>). In one corner of the court was the <foreign lang="greek">θόλος</foreign>, a circular building. In the midst of the court was the altar of <foreign lang="greek">Ζεὺς ἑρκεῖος</foreign>. In the court were two colonnades or porticoes, each called <foreign lang="greek">αἴθουσα</foreign>, one on either side right and left of the court-yard (<foreign lang="greek">αἴθουσα αὐλῆς</foreign>), and the other opposite the entrance to the court-yard and along the front of the <foreign lang="greek">δῶμα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign>. The latter is often considered as part of the <foreign lang="greek">πρόδομος</foreign>, so that <foreign lang="greek">αἴθουσα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">πρόδομος</foreign> are often used as synonymous terms. Crossing the <foreign lang="greek">αἴθουσα</foreign>, the visitor passed into the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">δῶμα</foreign>, where the chiefs lived. At either end of the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> was a door, one leading <cb /> into the court-yard through the <foreign lang="greek">αἴθουσα</foreign>, and the other into the women's apartments, the <foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος</foreign>, properly so called. In front of either door was a threshold (<foreign lang="greek">οὐδός</foreign>), probably raised. The threshold in front of the door into the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> was made of ash-wood, and the threshold in front of the door into the women's apartments was of stone, <foreign lang="greek">λάϊνος οὐδός</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 20. 258" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xx. 258</bibl>), a distinction which is most important for understanding the combat between Odysseus and the suitors. By the ashen threshold was the <foreign lang="greek">δουροδόκη</foreign>, or spear-stand, close to one of the pillars ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 1. 128" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>i. 128</bibl>). The <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> was of great size. In the palace of Odysseus the three hundred suitors of Penelopé feasted in it. Its height was that of the house itself, and its roof was supported by lofty pillars (<foreign lang="greek">κίονες</foreign>). In the upper part of the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> was the <foreign lang="greek">ἐσχάρα</foreign>, or hearth, where the food was cooked ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 20. 123" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xx. 123</bibl>), and the smoke escaped through a hole in the roof, as in the old Roman <seg lang="la">atrium.</seg> Besides the two principal doors of the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> already mentioned, there was a third, or postern-door, called <foreign lang="greek">ὀρσοθύρη</foreign>, the position of which has given rise to much dispute. It should, however, probably be placed, for the reasons given by Gardner and Jebb, on the side of the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign>, as shown in the plan (Plan, 6), leading into the <foreign lang="greek">λαύρη</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 22. 128" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxii. 128</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 137" default="NO"> Od., 137</bibl>), or narrow passage which gave access to the women's apartments from the outer court-yard, thus avoiding the necessity of passing through the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> (Plan, 8).</p>
 <p>The women's rooms, or <foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος</foreign>, properly so called, also styled <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρα γυναικῶν</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 22. 151" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxii. 151</bibl>), were immediately behind the <foreign lang="greek">μέγαρον</foreign> on the ground-floor, directly communicating with the latter by a door. This is clear from the whole narrative in the <title>Odyssey</title> of the combat between Odysseus and the suitors. The passages proving this have been critically examined by Prof. Jebb in the essay quoted below. (Cf. <bibl n="Homer Od. 17. 506" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xvii. 506</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 20. 389" default="NO"> Od., xx. 389</bibl>, etc.; see also iv. 718.) Here the women sat engaged in weaving and domestic occupations. Here was the nuptial chamber, with the marriage-bed made by Odysseus with his own hands ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 23. 192" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxiii. 192</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 295" default="NO"> Od., 295</bibl>). The ordinary sleeping and other rooms of the women were in the upper story (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερώϊον</foreign>), which was reached by a ladder, <foreign lang="greek">κλίμαξ</foreign> ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 21. 5" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxi. 5</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Homer Od. 2. 358" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>ii. 358</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 760" default="NO"> Od., iv. 760</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2. 514" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ii. 514</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 16. 184" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., xvi. 184</bibl>; Eustath. <bibl n="Eustathius ad Od. 1. 328" default="NO"> <title>ad Od.</title>i. 328</bibl>, p. 1420<bibl n="Eustathius ad Od. 53" default="NO"> ad Od., 53</bibl>). Hence we find Penelopé, after sleeping with Odysseus in the nuptial chamber, ascending with her handmaids into the upper chamber ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 23. 364" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxiii. 364</bibl>). It is therefore a mistake on the part of some modern writers to describe the women's rooms as situated only in the upper story. In the women's rooms was the armory (<foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος ὅπλων</foreign>, cf. <bibl n="Homer Od. 22. 140" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxii. 140</bibl><bibl n="Homer Od. 151" default="NO"> Od., 151</bibl>-156), and the treasury at the further extremity (<foreign lang="greek">θάλαμος ἔσχατος</foreign>), with a high roof ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 21. 8" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxi. 8</bibl>). In the women's part of the house there was also an open court, in which grew an olive-tree in the palace of Odysseus ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 23. 190" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>xxiii. 190</bibl>).</p>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">III. The later Greek House</hi>.—The discoveries of recent years have shown that bricks made of unbaked clay were very extensively used down to quite late times for the private houses of the Greeks, and this is one reason why examples of Hellenic domestic architecture are so very rare. Burnt bricks were first introduced by the Romans (Blümner, <title>Technol. u. Terminol.</title>, etc., ii. p. 11). Till quite recently very few remains of Greek houses were known to exist. The excavations, however, made in the Greek city of Naukratis in the Egyptian Delta during 1884-86 by Messrs. Flinders Petrie and Ernest Gardner have brought to light remains of a large number of Greek streets and <figure id="fig.00538">
<head orig="Plan of a Greek House at Naukratis in Egypt.">Plan of a Greek House at Naukratis in Egypt.</head>
</figure> houses, all built of sundried brick, coated with painted stucco. The accompanying figure shows part of Mr. Petrie's discoveries: A is a single house forming a complete <seg lang="la">insula</seg>, as the Romans would call it; it consists of six rooms, with what was probably a small central open court. B B appear to be shops. C C are narrow streets. In this Greek city the streets seem all to be very narrow, and the <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> are mostly very small—in many cases, like the figured example, consisting of one house only. Though but very scanty remains were found of the unbaked-brick walls, yet in a few places patches of painted stucco on the exterior were found <seg lang="la">in situ.</seg> Though walls of this sort would last very well so long as they were roofed over and protected by their coating of hard stucco, yet when once they had fallen into a ruined state the process of decay would be rapid and complete, even in Egypt, and of course much more so in a more rainy climate.</p>
 <p>The other more important examples of Greek domestic architecture which have yet been discovered are some houses in the Piraeus, the foundations of which were exposed in 1884 during the laying out of a new street by the municipality. (See Dr. Dörpfeld, in <title>Mittheil. d. deutsch. archäol. Inst. in Athen</title>, vol. ix. no. 3, 1884.) The figure shows a reduction made from Dr. Dörpfeld's plan.</p>
 <p>On the southeast and southwest sides the block faces upon streets; it appears to be a double <figure id="fig.00538.2">
<head orig="Plan of a Greek House discovered in the Piraeus.">Plan of a Greek House discovered in the Piraeus.</head>
</figure> <cb /> house, though this is not quite certain, owing to the impossibility of ascertaining the positions of all the doors. On the northwest side remains were found of a large open peristyle, apparently derived from the <foreign lang="greek">αὐλή</foreign> of the earlier Hellenic plan; under the covered porticus of this cloister an altar was found, probably dedicated to Zeus Herkeios. On the southeast side the house was entered through a long shallow porch, with two columns, in which stood another altar, probably that of Apollo Agyieus. This porch led into a small open court, surrounded on three sides by a covered walk (<foreign lang="greek">στοά</foreign> or <seg lang="la">porticus</seg>). The pavement of this was laid so as to drain into an open gully, through which the rainwater escaped into a drain. In one corner of the court was a well, and on the other side a stone cistern for storing water; a second cistern stood in the room adjoining the open court on the northwest. Some remains of paving were found, as is indicated on the plan. In one room it consists of stone flags; in another of a sort of rude mosaic, formed of pebbles set in concrete. On the southwest side are some rooms which were entered directly from the street, these may have been shops or public offices. Traces of a staircase leading to an upper floor were found at one end of the room with the flagging pavement. This block measures, without counting the large peristyle, about 140 feet by 75 feet. The clear open space of the peristyle was about 68 feet wide; its other dimension was not discovered. It is possible that this block may have been all part of the same house— one portion being the <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρωνῖτις</foreign>, or men's part, and the rest the <foreign lang="greek">γυναικωνῖτις</foreign>, or women's part.</p>
 <p>During the most flourishing period of Greece the private houses appear to have been small and simple in design; splendour of materials and ornament were reserved for the temples of the gods and the public buildings, such as the Agora and the great <foreign lang="greek">στοαί</foreign>, which in Athens especially contributed so largely to the architectural magnificence of the city. The front of the house towards the street was not large, as the apartments extended rather in the direction of its depth than of its width. In towns the houses were often built side by side, with party walls between (<foreign lang="greek">ὁμότοιχοι οἰκίαι</foreign>). The exterior wall was plain and often covered with plaster or stucco. Sometimes, as in Tanagra, the exterior was adorned with what was probably terra-cotta ( Dicaearch. p. 245, Fuhr). Plutarch says that Phocion's house was ornamented with plates of bronze ( <bibl n="Plut. Phoc. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Phoc.</title>18</bibl>). Unbaked clay, as we have already shown, was used for the walls; thus it was easy for the Plataeans to break through the party walls of their houses, so as to communicate with each other. For the same reason the burglar was called <foreign lang="greek">τοιχωρύχος</foreign>, because he found it easier to obtain an entrance into houses by breaking through the soft walls than by the door or windows ( <title>De Leg.</title> 831 E).</p>
 <p>Foreigners were specially struck by the mean appearance of the private houses of Athens in the time of Pericles, as strongly contrasting with the splendour of the public buildings ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Thuc.  65" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc., 65</bibl>). “A stranger,” says Dicaearchus, “might doubt upon a sudden view whether this were really the city of Athens,” so mean were the houses and crooked and narrow the streets. It was not till the time of Demosthenes that good houses began to be built in Athens.</p>
 <p>In all cases the country houses must have been

 much finer buildings than those in the old cities, where streets were narrow and sites often very cramped (Isocr. <title>Areop.</title> 20). Thucydides (ii. 14) speaks of the preference of the Athenians for houses in the country. See <ref type="cross" target="crossvilla">Villa</ref>.</p>
 <p>The plan and whole arrangement of town and country houses would naturally be absolutely different, and it is unreasonable to suppose that one fixed type of house was used by the Greeks. Existing remains show us that the Roman houses had as many varieties of plan as we have now, and yet many archaeologists have written as if there was one stereotyped plan of house used in classical times. The somewhat pedantic language of Vitruvius (vi. 7, 10) on the subject has tended to support the belief in the existence of one fixed type of Greek house, but at his date, in the reign of Augustus, archaeology was practically an unknown science, and it may reasonably be suggested that the so-called Greek plan of Vitruvius does not represent the domestic architecture of the bygone days when the Greeks were an independent race, but rather Vitruvius's private notion, as a practising architect, of a house to be built for some wealthy Roman in the revived pseudo-Hellenic style which began to be popular in the reigns of the early emperors of Rome.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, many of Vitruvius's statements may be of great use in illustrating difficult passages in older Greek writers, which treat of some details in the Hellenic house, especially when the description is compared with some of the existing Roman dwellings, which are evidently designed to some extent after a real or supposed Greek model.</p>
 <p>Greek houses had three principal features in common. First, there were one or two open courts, surrounded by the various rooms. Secondly, in a Greek family the women lived in private apartments allotted to their respective use. Hence the house was always divided into two distinct portions, already mentioned—the Andronitis (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνδρωνῖτις</foreign>), or men's apartments, and the Gynaeconitis (<foreign lang="greek">γυναικωνῖτις</foreign>), or women's apartments. Thirdly, the Gynaeconitis was, as a general rule, in larger houses behind the Andronitis, and on the same floor as the latter Much difficulty has been occasioned in the arrangement of a Greek house by the statement of Vitruvius (vi. 7 [10]) that the principal entrance led at once into the Gynaeconitis, and that the Andronitis therefore was behind the women's rooms, or rather, if we construe his words strictly, by their side. But such an arrangement is alike inconsistent with the careful state of seclusion in which the Greek women were kept, and also with the positive statements of the writers of the period. It is very likely that Vitruvius misunderstood to some extent the descriptions given by his Greek authorities, and has assigned to the Gynaeconitis the arrangement of the Andronitis.</p>
 <p>The plan below of the ground-floor of a Greek house of the larger size, with two courts or peristyles, is taken, with slight alterations, from Guhl and Koner. It is of course conjectural, but it will serve for the <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> arrangements (for further we cannot go) of the Greek house at the period we are speaking of. Other plans, differing very much from this, have been given by several modern writers; but this appears on the whole the most consistent with the ancient authorities. In smaller <cb /> houses the Gynaeconitis was much more limited, having no open court, and in some cases was restricted to the upper story.</p>
 <p>Some other matters connected with a Greek house require notice.</p>
 <p>(1) <title>Upper Stories.</title>—When there was an upper story (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερῷον, διῆρες</foreign>), it seldom extended over the whole space occupied by the lower story. The principal use of the upper story was for the sleeping apartments, both of the family and of the slaves. Houses rarely had more than two stories; but in later times we find in the larger towns mention of houses with three stories (<foreign lang="greek">τριστέγη</foreign>, <bibl n="Artemid.  4. 46" default="NO">Artemid.iv. 46</bibl>; Acts, xx. 8, 9). The access to the upper floor seems to have been sometimes by stairs (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναβαθμοί</foreign>) on the outside of the house, leading up from the street, as was the case at Rome (Aristot. <bibl n="Xen. Ec. 2. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oec.</title>ii. 5</bibl>, p. 1347<bibl n="Xen. Ec. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> Oec., 5</bibl>). The upper story was sometimes let, or used for lodging guests ( <title>De Venef.</title> 14). But in some large houses there were rooms set apart for the reception of guests (<foreign lang="greek">ξενῶνες</foreign>) on the ground-floor. 
<pb n="540" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Portions of the upper story sometimes projected beyond the walls of the lower part, forming balconies or verandas (<foreign lang="greek">προβολαί, γεισιποδίσματα</foreign>, Pollux, i. 81), like the Roman <hi rend="italic">maeniana.</hi></p>
 <p>(2) <title>Roofs.</title>—The roofs were generally flat, and it was customary to walk about upon them, as on the <seg lang="la">solaria</seg> at Rome ( <title>adv. Simon.</title> 11; <title>Lysistr.</title> 389), or to pass from one house to another (Demosth. <title>c. Androt.</title> p. 609. 53). But highpitched roofs were also used, covered with tiles (<foreign lang="greek">κέραμος</foreign>, Pollux, i. 81).</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Doors.</title>—For particulars, see <ref type="cross" target="crossianua">Ianua</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossclavis">Clavis</ref>. In the interior of the house the place of doors was sometimes supplied by curtains (<foreign lang="greek">παραπετάσματα, παρακαλύμματα</foreign>), which also hung between the pillars of the peristyle. They were either plain, dyed, or embroidered (Pollux, x. 32; Theophr. 5). <figure id="fig.00540">
<head orig="Aula of Greek House. (Von Falke.)">Aula of Greek House. (Von Falke.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>(4) <title>Windows.</title>—The principal openings for the admission of light and air were in the uncovered peristyle and perhaps in the roofed part of the peristyle; but it is incorrect to suppose that the houses had no windows (<foreign lang="greek">θυρίδες</foreign>), or at least none overlooking the street. They appear to have been chiefly in the upper story, and in ancient works of art women are represented looking out of them ( <title>Thesm.</title> 797, <title>Eccles.</title> 961).</p>
 <p>(5) <title>Privies.</title>—These were called <foreign lang="greek">ἀπόπατοι, ἄφοδοι</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">κοπρῶνες</foreign>. Their position is nowhere expressly indicated, but they were probably, as in Roman houses (see below), in proximity to the kitchen.</p>
 <p>(6) <title>Heating.</title>—Artificial warmth was procured by little portable stoves (<foreign lang="greek">ἐσχάρια, ἐσχαρίδες</foreign>) or chafing-dishes (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνθράκια</foreign>). (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfocus">Focus</ref>.) It is often supposed that the chimney was altogether unknown, <cb /> and that the smoke escaped through an opening in the roof; but it is not easy to understand how this could be the case when there was an upper story. The <foreign lang="greek">καπνοδόκη</foreign> mentioned by Herodotus (viii. 137) was not really a chimney, but only an opening in the roof. But the <foreign lang="greek">κάπνη</foreign> of Aristophanes ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 143" default="NO"> <title>Vesp.</title>143</bibl>) seems to have been really a chimney, as it is described by the Scholiast on the passage as pipe-shaped (<foreign lang="greek">σωληνοειδής</foreign>). In any case, the chimney seems to have been used only in the kitchen (<foreign lang="greek">ὀπτάνιον</foreign>, Alexis <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Athen. ix. p. 386 b).</p>
 <p>(7) <title>Decoration.</title>—The decorations of the interior were very plain at the period to which our description refers. The floors were mere plaster. At a late period coloured stones were used ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  184" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 184</bibl>). Mosaics are first mentioned as introduced under the kings of Pergamus. The walls, up to the fourth century B.C., seem to have been only whitewashed. The first instance of painting them is that of Alcibiades ( <title>In Alcib.</title> 17)—an innovation that met with considerable opposition ( <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 3. 8. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Mem.</title>iii. 8. 10</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 9. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>ix. 2</bibl>). Plato mentions the painting of the walls of houses as a mark of a <foreign lang="greek">τρυφῶσα πόλις</foreign> (<title>Repub.</title> ii. 373 A). These allusions prove that the practice was not uncommon in the time of Plato and Xenophon. We have also mention of painted ceilings at the same period, and at a later period this mode of decoration became general.</p>
 <p>(8) <title>Letting and Price of Houses.</title>—There was a great deal of speculation in the building and letting of houses at Athens ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 3. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>iii. 1</bibl>). A distinction was made at Athens between the <foreign lang="greek">οἰκία</foreign>, which was a dwelling-house for a single family, and the <foreign lang="greek">συνοικία</foreign>, which was adapted to hold several 
<pb n="541" /><cb /> families—like the Roman <seg lang="la">insula.</seg> The lodging-houses were let mostly to foreigners who came to Athens on business, and especially to the <foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>, whom the law did not allow to acquire real property, and who therefore could not purchase houses of their own. Pasion, the banker, had a lodging-house valued at 100 minas (Demosth. <title>c. Steph.</title> i. p. 1110. 28). Two counting-houses are mentioned by Isaeus (<title>De Hagn. Her.</title> 42) as yielding a return of rather more than 8 1/2 per cent. interest on the purchase-money. But this probably was much below the average. The summer season was the most profitable for the letting of houses, when merchants and other visitors flocked to Athens. The rent was commonly paid by the month. Lodging-houses were frequently taken on speculation by persons called <foreign lang="greek">ναύκληροι</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σταθμοῦχοι</foreign> (Ammon. , Harpocrat.), who made a profit by underletting them, and sometimes for not very reputable purposes (Isaeus , <title>De Philoct. Her.</title> 19). Boeckh has given an account from the ancient writers of the prices of houses at Athens, which seem to have been very small. They varied from 3 minas ($54) to 120 minas ($2160), according to their size, situation, and condition, from 30 to 50 minas ($540 to $900) being an ordinary price (Boeckh, <title>Publ. Econ. of Athens</title>, pp. 65, 141; <title>Staatshaush.</title> i. p. 84).</p>

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">IV. The Roman House</hi>.—The earliest dwellings of the Latins on the Palatine Hill were probably mere huts of mud-daubed osiers, like the hut of Romulus, which was preserved as a sacred relic for many centuries. After the burning of Rome by the Gauls, the city was rebuilt in haste, with very narrow streets and on no regular plan ( <bibl n="Liv.  5. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.v. 55</bibl>). Even the houses of the richest citizens were small and of inexpensive materials, such as unburnt brick or soft brown tufa. No examples of fired bricks are known in Roman buildings till the time of Iulius Caesar; and the remarks of Vitruvius seem to refer wholly to crude or sun-dried bricks, of which no examples in Rome have survived to modern times. Down to the beginning of the last century of the Republic, Romans of rank continued to live in small houses. In B.C. 125, the censors censured Lepidus, the augur, because he paid 6000 sesterces (about $250) for his house rent (Vell. Paterc. ii. 10); and Sulla , when a young man, paid only 3000 sesterces for his rooms on the ground-floor, while a freedman in the upper part of the same house paid only 2000 sesterces, or $80 ( <title>Sall.</title> c. 1).</p>
 <p>The earliest regulation we find respecting houses is a law of the Twelve Tables that each building should be separated from another by a space of 2 1/2 feet called <seg lang="la">ambitus</seg> ( Fest. pp. 5<bibl n="Fest.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 11</bibl>, M.). But this enactment was disregarded, and was again enforced by Nero when he rebuilt the city ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xv. 43</bibl>; see below). As Rome increased in population, the houses were raised in height. The <seg lang="la">insula</seg>, in which the lower and middle classes lived, was a building of several stories, let out in <cb /> flats or separate rooms to different families or persons. The <seg lang="la">domus</seg> or <seg lang="la">aedes privatae</seg>, on the contrary, was a separate house, in later times a palace, usually with only one story above the ground-floor, the abode of the rich and great, and inhabited for the most part by a single family; though, as in the case of the palazzi in modern Rome, parts of them, especially at the back or top of the <seg lang="la">domus</seg>, were sometimes rented (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 1. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Trin.</title>i. 2</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Trin. 157" default="NO" valid="yes"> Trin., 157</bibl>;  <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 44" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>44</bibl>, <title>Vitell.</title> 7). In the general description of a Roman house our remarks apply only to the <seg lang="la">domus</seg>, properly so called, as the <seg lang="la">insula</seg> was built on an entirely different plan.</p>
 <p>The <ref type="cross" target="crossinsula">insula</ref> is defined by Festus (p. 111, M.) to be a building not joined by common walls with neighbouring houses, but surrounded by a street, so that it stood like an island surrounded by rivers or the sea. It was thus, as has been said, very much like one of the large hotels in modern cities, with one or more courts, and bounded on all sides by streets, like the Louvre Hotel at Paris. The ground-floor was usually rented for shops (<seg lang="la">tabernae</seg>), and the upper stories in flats or separate rooms, as in continental and American cities at the present day. Such an <seg lang="la">insula</seg>, containing various tenements and shops, is the house of Pansa at Pompeii, described below. The number of <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> at Rome naturally exceeded that of the <seg lang="la">domus;</seg> and accordingly we find in the <title>Notitia</title>, which was compiled between A.D. 334 and 357, that there were at Rome 44,171 <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> and 1782 <seg lang="la">domus</seg> (Marquardt, <title>Staatsverw.</title> ii. p. 120). To the same effect Suetonius, in describing the fire at Rome under Nero, speaks of the “immense number” of <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> that were burned, in addition to the palaces (<seg lang="la">domus</seg>) of the nobles ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 38" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>38</bibl>). Becker and some other writers erroneously suppose that a single floor or a separate room in such a house was also called <seg lang="la">insula</seg>, but the proper name for such a separate lodging was <seg lang="la">cenaculum</seg> (Becker-Göll, <title>Gallus</title>, ii. p. 221).</p>
 <p>It was apparently usual for an <seg lang="la">insula</seg> to have been built on speculation, and let by the proprietor to different occupants ( <bibl n="Plut. Crass. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Crass.</title>2</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  4. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.iv. 37</bibl>). Hence the stories or separate rooms were called <seg lang="la">cenacula meritoria</seg> ( <title>Vitell.</title> 7; <bibl n="Juv.  3. 234" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 234</bibl>) or <seg lang="la">conducta.</seg> Cicero had some shops, which he let ( <title>Ad Att.</title> xiv. 9). The rent (<seg lang="la">pensio</seg>) at Rome was considerable, even for a miserable garret ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 166" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 166</bibl><bibl n="Juv.  225" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv., 225</bibl>). Poor persons in the time of Iulius Caesar appear to have paid 2000 sesterces ($80 or $85) as the usual rent ( <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 38" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>38</bibl>). Caelius was said to have paid 30,000 sesterces (about $1200) for the rent of a third floor in the <seg lang="la">insula</seg> of P. Clodius, though Cicero says the real rent was only one third of this sum ( <bibl n="Cic. Cael. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cael.</title>7</bibl> <bibl n="Cic. Cael. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">17</bibl>). The <seg lang="la">insularii</seg> were not the occupants of the <seg lang="la">insulae</seg>, but the agents who had charge of the <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> and collected the rents. They were also called <seg lang="la">procuratores insularum.</seg> The <seg lang="la">insula</seg> appears to have been named after the person to whom it belonged. Thus we find in inscriptions the <title>insula Arriana Polliana</title>, the <title>insula Sertoriana</title>, etc. (Orelli, 4324).</p>
 <p>The upper stories and the separate rooms of the <seg lang="la">insula</seg> were, as we have already said, called <seg lang="la">cenacula.</seg> This word properly signifies rooms to dine in; but after it became the fashion to dine in the upper part of the house, all the rooms above the ground-floor were called <seg lang="la">cenacula</seg> (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 162). There were different flights of stairs connecting the upper stories with the lower part of the house, as we find to be the case in houses at 
<pb n="542" /><cb /> Pompeii. Sometimes the stairs had no connection with the lower part of the house, but ascended at once from the street ( <bibl n="Liv.  39. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxix. 14</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  2" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 2</bibl>; xxi. 62<bibl n="Liv.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 3</bibl>). As the different stories could not all be lighted from openings in the roof, as in the <seg lang="la">domus</seg>, they had windows looking out into the street ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 41</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  24. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., xxiv. 21</bibl>). They also had sometimes balconies, supported by brackets, projecting into the street, from which an occupant could shake hands with his next-door or opposite neighbour ( <bibl n="Mart.  1. 86" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 86</bibl>). These balconies were called <hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi>, and the same name was also given to the stories which projected over those below, as we see in some old houses in England ( Fest. p. 134<bibl n="Fest.  22" default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 22</bibl>, M.; <bibl n="Isid.  15. 3" default="NO">Isid.xv. 3</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  11" default="NO">Isid., 11</bibl>; Vitruv. v. 1, 2). Projecting stories were forbidden in A.D. 368 to be erected in Rome (Ammian. Marcell. xxvii. 9, 8) on account of the narrowness of the streets, and were again forbidden by the emperors Honorius and Theodosius unless there was an open space, in some cases of ten, in others of fifteen feet, clear of any adjacent building (<title>Cod. Iust.</title> viii. 10, 11). Such a projecting story is seen in some of the Pompeian houses. </p>
 <p>We find mention of a house three stories high in B.C. 218 ( <bibl n="Liv.  21. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxi. 62</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 3</bibl>); and Martial considered the third story, where he lived, as very high. If we were to estimate the height of the Roman houses by the way in which they are spoken of by the ancient writers, we should probably assign to them too many stories; for the houses, as Friedländer observes, very likely appeared higher than they really were in consequence of the narrowness of the streets. We have no express mention of any houses more than four stories high; but from various circumstances we may infer that some of the houses at Rome had a larger number of stories than are expressly mentioned. Thus Augustus limited the height of houses to seventy feet, which implies that they had been built still higher, and Cicero describes the houses as hoisted up and suspended in the air (<title>Leg. Agr.</title> ii. 35, 96). See Friedländer, <title>Sittengesch. Roms</title>, i. p. 5 foll.</p>
 <p>The houses let for hire were in Rome, as in modern <cb /> cities at the present day, badly built by speculators. The upper stories were of wood (<seg lang="la">tabulata, contignationes</seg>) and frequently fell down, while their material made them more liable to fires, which were very frequent in Rome. Catullus speaks ironically of the advantages of a beggar, who had nothing to fear from fire or the fall of houses. The returns from house property in Rome were large, but people feared to invest in it on account of fires ( <bibl n="Gel.  15. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xv. 1</bibl>). The inundations of the Tiber also caused the fall of houses. For further details, see Friedländer, i. p. 26 foll.</p>
 <p>It was not, however, till the reign of Nero that a complete reform was effected in the arrangement and construction of the houses and streets of Rome. Nero had a new and elaborate Building Act drawn up, which required fire-proof materials, such as <hi rend="italic">peperino</hi>, a hard volcanic stone, to be used for the external walls of houses. He also enacted that each building should have separate walls and a space (<seg lang="la">ambitus</seg>) left open all round it. As a means of escape and assistance in the case of fire he also caused arcades or colonnades to be built at his own expense in front of the <seg lang="la">insulae.</seg> In Trajan's reign the limit of height for street houses was fixed at sixty feet (Aurel. Vict. <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 13" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>13</bibl>). The emperors Antoninus and Verus again made an ordinance about the space to be left round the <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> (<title>Dig.</title> viii. 2, 14).</p>
 <p>We now turn to the history and construction of the <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">domus</ref>, or mansion of the great and wealthy. It was not till the last century of the Republic, when wealth had been acquired by conquests in the East, that houses of any splendour began to be built; but it then became the fashion not only to build houses of an immense size, but to adorn them with marble columns, paintings, statues, and costly works of art. They covered a large space, most of the rooms being on the ground-floor. The spacious <seg lang="la">atria</seg> and <seg lang="la">peristylia</seg>, being open to the sky, did not permit an upper story, which, if it existed, must have been confined to the sides of the building, and could not have been very high, as otherwise it would have darkened the <seg lang="la">atria</seg> and <seg lang="la">peristylia.</seg> These splendid mansions were erected for the most part on the hills and along the slopes of the Palatine, on the side near the Forum, which was the favourite quarter for the Roman nobles. In later times the various palaces of the emperors swallowed up almost the whole of this site.</p>
 <p>The house of the orator L. Crassus on the Palatine, built about B.C. 92, was the first which had marble columns. For this, Crassus was severely blamed, and the stern republican M. Brutus nicknamed him the “Palatine Venus.” This house was valued at 6,000,000 sesterces (about $240,000); but Pliny says that it yielded in magnificence to the house of Q. Catulus on the same hill, and was much inferior to that of C. Aquilius on the Viminal. The house of Catulus had a fine colonnade (<seg lang="la">porticus</seg>), adorned with the spoils of the Cimbric War. It was near the house of Cicero, as a portion of the colonnade was destroyed when Clodius razed the house of Cicero (Val. Max. vi. 3. 1).</p>
 <p>In B.C. 78, M. Lepidus, for the first time in Rome, used the rich Numidian marble not only for columns, but even for the thresholds of his doors; yet the fashion of building magnificent houses increased so rapidly that the house of Lepidus, which in his consulship was the first in 
<pb n="543" /><cb /> Rome, was thirty-five years later eclipsed by a hundred others. Lucullus was especially celebrated for the magnificence of his houses. The Romans were exceedingly fond of marble for the decoration of their abodes. An advance in costly magnificence was made by the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus in the middle of the first century B.C. He purchased the house of L. Crassus and greatly enlarged it. He introduced, as the supports of his atrium, columns of the black “Lucullean” marble no less than thirty-eight feet in height, and of which the weight was so great that he had to provide security for an indemnity in case of injury that might be done to the main sewers while these immense blocks of marble were being carted through the streets ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 5</bibl> foll.). This house was sold to Clodius for nearly 15,000,000 sesterces (about $600,000)—a price, says Pliny , worthy of the madness of kings. This is the highest price recorded in the time of the Republic for a house. The consul Messalla bought the house of Autronius for 3,400,000 sesterces (about $140,000), and Cicero the house of Crassus (not L. Crassus, the orator) for 3,500,000 sesterces (about $140,000) ( <title>Ad Att.</title> i. 13, 6, with Tyrrell's note; <title>Ad Fam.</title> v. 6). Cicero's house was on the lower slope of the Palatine towards the <title>Regia</title>, the official residence of Iulius Caesar as Pontifex Maximus, whom Cicero calls his neighbour (<title>Ad Fam.</title> v. 6, <title>Ad Att.</title> xiii. 45). These houses will serve as samples of the value of the mansions of the nobles during the Republic. Sallust speaks of them as like cities in size ( <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>12</bibl>), and Seneca describes them in the same terms under the Empire ( <bibl n="Plin.

Many of them, like the houses of Sallust and Maecenas, described below, were surrounded by gardens. The rich noble, we are told, was not content unless he had a <seg lang="la">rus in urbe</seg> ( <bibl n="Mart.  12. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.xii. 57</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  21" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 21</bibl>), and the extensive pleasure-grounds are alluded to in other passages.</p>
 <p>According to Vitruvius, the principal parts of a Roman house were: (1) <title>Vestibulum</title>,</p>

 <p>(4) <title>Alae</title>,</p>

 <p>(6) <title>Fauces</title>,</p>
 <p>(7) <title>Peristylium.</title> The parts of a house which were considered of less importance, and of which the arrangement differed in different houses, were: (1) <title>Cubicula</title>,</p>

 <p>(3) <title>Oeci</title>,</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Exedrae</title>,</p>

 <p>(11) <title>Diaetae</title>,</p>
 <p>(12) <title>Solaria</title>,</p>
 <p>(13) <title>Cellae.</title> We shall speak of each in order.</p>
 <p>(1) <title>Vestibulum.</title>—There has been much dispute respecting the exact signification of this word, which has arisen from the different meanings attached to it at different periods of history and in different kinds of houses. In the palaces of the nobles the <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> was a vacant space before the house, forming a court-yard or entrance-court, surrounded on three sides by the house, and open on the fourth to the street. The two wings ran out beyond the façade of the building, and the door was in the third side opposite the street. In some houses the projecting sides were occupied by shops opening into the street. In the <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> the clients assembled, till the door was opened, to pay their respects (<seg lang="la">salutatio</seg>) to the master of the house, so that they might not be left standing either in the street or within the house ( <bibl n="Gel.  16. 5. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xvi. 5. 3</bibl><bibl n="Gel.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell., 8</bibl>; <seg lang="la">vestibulum, quod est ante domum</seg>, <cb /> Varr. <title>L. L.</title> vii. 81; Macrob. vi. 8. 15). Hence in the smaller houses in Rome and the municipal towns, there was either no <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg>, so that the door opened straight upon the street, or the <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> was simply indicated by the door standing back a few feet from the street, as in many of the houses at Pompeii. Sometimes there were steps from the street leading up to the <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 84" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>84</bibl>). In the houses of the nobility the <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> was adorned with statues, arms, and other trophies ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  7" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 7</bibl>). Public buildings also had <seg lang="la">vestibula</seg>, as the curia or senate-house ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 48</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  2. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., ii. 48</bibl>), and various temples ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 86" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>86</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>Ostium.</title>—The <seg lang="la">ostium</seg> was the entrance to the house, and is constantly used as synonymous with <seg lang="la">ianua</seg> and <seg lang="la">fores</seg>, “the door.” But <seg lang="la">ostium</seg> properly signified the small vacant space before the <seg lang="la">ianua</seg>, whence Plautus ( <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 5. 1" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pers.</title>v. 1</bibl><bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> Pers., 6</bibl>) says <seg lang="la">ante ostium et ianuam.</seg> Here stood the <seg lang="la">antae</seg> (q. v.), two posts or pillars flanking the doorway. On the threshold the word <title>Salve</title> was frequently wrought in mosaic, as we see in the Pompeian houses; and over the threshold there sometimes hung a cage containing a magpie or a parrot, taught to greet those who entered ( <bibl n="Petron.  28" default="NO">Petron.28</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  7. 87" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vii. 87</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 6</bibl>; xiv. 76). Over the door a few words of good omen were sometimes written, such as <seg lang="la">nihil intret mali</seg> (OrelliHenz. <title>Inscr.</title> 7287), or <seg lang="la">deprecatio incendiorum</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 28.  20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxviii. 20</bibl>). Sometimes the house was indicated by a sign over the door, as in mediaeval times. Thus we are told that Augustus was born <title>ad Capita Bubula</title> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>5</bibl>), and Domitian, <title>ad Malum Punicum</title> ( <bibl n="Suet. Dom. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Dom.</title>1</bibl>). The street-door itself is fully described under <ref type="cross" target="crossianua">Ianua</ref>.</p>
 <p>Whether the street-door opened into a hall or directly into the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> has been a subject of dispute. Vitruvius mentions no entrance-hall in a Roman house; but there are reasons for believing there must have been an entrance-hall in the palaces of the nobility, as behind the door there was a small room (<seg lang="la">cella</seg>) for the house-porter (<seg lang="la">ostiarius</seg> or <seg lang="la">ianitor</seg>), and it is difficult to suppose that this was in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> ( <bibl n="Petron.  28" default="NO">Petron.28</bibl>), especially as a dog was kept by his side, chained to the wall, with a written warning <title>Cave Canem</title> (Plaut. <title>Most.</title> iii. 2, 169). Sometimes a dog was painted on the wall ( <bibl n="Petron.  29" default="NO">Petron.29</bibl>) or wrought in mosaic on the pavement, as we find in the House of the Tragic Poet at Pompeii. (See illust. p. 296.) At the end of the hall, which seems to have been called <seg lang="la">ostium</seg>, there was no inner door, as Becker describes, but the entrance to the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> was closed by a curtain (<seg lang="la">velum</seg>), which was drawn aside by the usher when he admitted strangers to an interview (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 5, <title>Heliog.</title> 14;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>20</bibl>). The entrance-hall was small, so that a person in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> could look through it at those walking in the street ( <title>Calig.</title> 41).
 </p>
 <p>(3) <title>Atrium.</title>—The first point to be determined in connection with the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, upon which the whole disposition of a Roman house depends, is whether the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">cavum aedium</seg> or <hi rend="italic">cavaedium</hi> denote two separate courts or one and the same. Some modern writers maintain that they were distinct courts, and accordingly place three courts in a Roman house—first the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, then the <seg lang="la">cavum aedium</seg> in the centre, and lastly the <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg> in the rear. But this view cannot be maintained; it is rejected by the best modern authorities; it is in direct opposition to the statements of Varro (<title>L. L.</title> v. 161) and Vitruvius (vi. 3 and 8), who call 
 sometimes the chief room of the house <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and sometimes <seg lang="la">cavum aedium;</seg> and it is contradicted by the fact that no houses in Pompeii have yet been discovered containing more than two courts —namely, the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">peristylium.</seg> We may therefore conclude that the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">cavum aedium</seg> denote the same room, the only difference perhaps being that <seg lang="la">cavum aedium</seg> indicated originally the open part, and <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> the entire area; but in general the two words are used as synonymous. The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> or <seg lang="la">cavum aedium</seg> was a large room or court roofed over, with the exception of an opening in the centre, called <seg lang="la">compluvium</seg>, twoards which the roof sloped so as to throw the rain-water into a cistern in the floor, termed <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg> (Varr. 1. c.; Fest. p. 108, M.; Liv. xliii. 13<bibl n="Liv.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 6</bibl>; <bibl n="Pl. Am. 5.1.56" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Amph.</title> v. 1, 56</bibl>). The water from the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg> flowed into a well (<seg lang="la">puteus</seg>) under ground; for before the construction of the aqueducts the Romans were dependent upon wells for their supply of water. The word <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, however, is sometimes employed in a wider sense to denote the whole uncovered space in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, and therefore the opening in the top as well as the cistern at the bottom ( <title>Act. in Verr.</title> i. 23, 61, with the note of Pseudo-Ascon. p. 177, Or.). <title>Compluvium</title> in like manner is sometimes used in the same wide signification as equivalent to <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>92</bibl>). The <seg lang="la">compluvium</seg> was sometimes covered with hangings, as a protection against the sun (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10. 595" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>x. 595</bibl>). The breadth of the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, according to Vitruvius, was not less than a quarter nor greater than a third of the breadth of the <seg lang="la">atrium;</seg> its length was in the same proportion according to the length of the <seg lang="la">atrium.</seg></p>
 <p>Vitruvius (vi. 3) distinguishes five kinds of <seg lang="la">atria</seg> or <seg lang="la">cava aedium</seg>, which were called by the following names:</p>
 <p><title>(a) Tuscanicum.</title> In this the roof was supported by four beams, crossing each other at right angles, the included space forming the <seg lang="la">compluvium.</seg> This kind of <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> was the most ancient of all.</p>
 <p><title>(b) Tetrastylum.</title> This was of the same form as the preceding, except that the main beams of the roof were supported by pillars, placed at the four angles of the <seg lang="la">impluvium.</seg></p>
 <p><title>(c) Corinthium</title> was on the same principle as the <cb /> tetrastyle, only that there were a greater number of pillars around the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, on which the beams of the roof rested.</p>
 <p><title>(d) Displuviatum</title> had its roof sloping the contrary way to the <seg lang="la">compluvium</seg>, so that the water fell outside the house instead of being carried into the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, and was carried off by gutters.</p>
 <p><title>(e) Testudinatum</title> was constructed in the same way as the <hi rend="italic">displuviatum</hi>, but it was roofed all over and had no <seg lang="la">compluvium.</seg> We are not informed, however, how light was admitted into an <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> of this kind.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, as we have already seen, was originally the only room of the house, serving as sitting-room, bedroom, and kitchen, which it probably continued to do among the lower classes even in later times ( <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 726" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>i. 726</bibl><bibl n="Verg. A. 9. 648" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. Aen., ix. 648</bibl>). Here was the <seg lang="la">focus</seg>, or hearth, which served not only for cooking, but from its sacred character was used also for the receptacle of the Lares or Penates that were sometimes kept in little cupboards near the hearth (Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Aul. 2. 18" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aul.</title>ii. 18</bibl><bibl n="Pl. Aul. 15" default="NO" valid="yes"> Aul., 15</bibl>; Tibull. i. 10, 20; <bibl n="Juv.  8. 110" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.viii. 110</bibl>; <bibl n="Petron.  29" default="NO">Petron.29</bibl>). The Lar, or tutelary god of the house, stood close to the entrance behind the door leading into the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 136" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 136</bibl> foll.); and we find him so placed in some of the Pompeian houses. Near the sacred flame the members of the family took the common meal, and the same custom continued in the country even in the time of Augustus ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 6" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 6</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 65" default="NO"> Sat., 65</bibl> foll.). In the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> the master of the house kept his <seg lang="la">arca</seg> (q. v.), or money-chest, which was fastened to the floor. Here stood the nuptial bed (<seg lang="la">lectus genialis</seg>) against the back wall, opposite the entrance to the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, whence it was also called <seg lang="la">lectus adversus</seg> ( <bibl n="Gel.  16. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xvi. 9</bibl>). Here sat the mistress of the house, spinning and weaving with her maids ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 57</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv., 9</bibl>). Here all visits were paid and here the patron received his clients ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 5</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 31" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 31</bibl>). Here the corpse was placed before it was carried out to burial. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfunus">Funus</ref>.) Here, in the <seg lang="la">alae</seg>, were placed the waxen <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> (q. v.) of the ancestors of the house.</p>
 <p>But as wealth increased, and numerous clients came to wait upon their patron, new rooms were built, and the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> ceased to be the only room for the family. A kitchen (<seg lang="la">culina</seg>) was made for 
<pb n="545" /><cb />
 cooking; the Lares were placed in a special <seg lang="la">lararium;</seg> the meals were taken in the upper story, hence called <seg lang="la">cenaculum;</seg> the master and mistress slept in a separate <seg lang="la">cubiculum.</seg> As the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> now became the reception-room, it was fitted up among the wealthy with much splendour and magnificence for the reception of their clients. The opening in the roof was enlarged for the admission of more light, and was supported by pillars frequently made of costly marble. Between the pillars and along the walls, statues and other works of art were placed ( <title>Verr.</title> i. 23, 61). In the middle of the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg> was a marble fountain, with jets of water, frequently adorned with reliefs, of which many beautiful specimens have been found at Pompeii. Near the fountain, where the hearth formerly stood, was a marble table, called <seg lang="la">cartibulum</seg> (q.v.). The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, however, still continued, as in ancient times, to be the chief room of the house, and it was not only the room for the reception of guests, but its primitive character was preserved by its retaining the symbolical nuptial couch ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 1</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 87" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 87</bibl>), the <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> of the ancestors, and the instruments for weaving and spinning.</p>
 <p>The rooms which opened out of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> were lighted only through the <seg lang="la">compluvium</seg>, as there were no windows, as a general rule, upon the ground-floor.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <title>Alae</title>, wings, were two small quadrangular apartments or recesses on the left and right sides of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> (Vitruv. vi. 4), but at its farther end and open to the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, as we see in the Pompeian houses. Here the <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> were kept in the houses of the nobles. But as the <seg lang="la">alae</seg> were really a part of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, the <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> were frequently described as standing in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> ( <bibl n="Juv.  8. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.viii. 19</bibl> foll.; <cb /> <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 6</bibl>; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 1. 591" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>i. 591</bibl>; Marquardt, <title>Privatl.</title> p. 235).
 </p>
 <p>(5) <title>Tablinum</title> was in all probability a recess or room at the farther end of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> opposite the door leading into the hall, and was regarded as part of the <seg lang="la">atrium.</seg> It contained the family records and archives (Vitruv. vi. 4 and 8). It appears, from the houses of Pompeii, to have been separated not by a door, but simply by a curtain or <seg lang="la">velum</seg>, while it had a door at the back leading into the <seg lang="la">peristylium.</seg> Marquardt supposes that the <seg lang="la">tablinum</seg> was originally an alcove made of wood (whence its name) built at the back of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, in which meals were taken during the summer, and was afterwards joined to the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> by breaking through the walls of the latter.</p>
 <p>With the <seg lang="la">tablinum</seg> the Roman house appears to have originally ceased, the sleeping-rooms being arranged on the upper floor. But when the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and its surrounding rooms were used for the reception of clients and other public visitors, it became necessary to increase the size of the house, and the following rooms were accordingly added:
 </p>
 <p>(6) <title>Fauces</title> was a passage by the side of the <seg lang="la">tablinum</seg>, which passed from the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> to the <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg>, or open court, as we see in the Pompeian houses. We must not suppose, however, that the plural indicates two passages (Vitruv. vi. 4).
 </p>
 <p>(7) <title>Peristylium</title> was in its general form like the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, but it was one third greater in breadth, measured transversely, than in length (Vitruv. vi. 4); but we do not find these proportions preserved in the Pompeian houses. It was a court open to the sky in the middle; the open part, which was surrounded by columns, had a fountain in the centre, and was planted with flowers, shrubs, and trees forming a <hi rend="italic">viridarium.</hi> The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg> were the two important parts of a Roman house.</p>
 <p>The arrangement of the rooms leading out of the <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg>, which are next to be noticed, varied, as has been remarked, according to the taste and circumstances of the owner. It is therefore impossible to assign to them any regular place in the house.</p>
 <p><title>(a) Cubicula</title>, bed-chambers, appear to have been usually small. There were separate <seg lang="la">cubicula</seg> for the day and night (<seg lang="la">cubicula diurna et nocturna</seg>,  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>i. 3</bibl>); the latter were also called <seg lang="la">dormitoria</seg>, and were mostly on the upper floor (<seg lang="la">id.</seg> v. 6<bibl n="Plin. Ep. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 21</bibl>). Vitruvius (vi. 7) recommends that they should face the east for the benefit of the rising sun. They sometimes had a small ante-room, which was called by the Greek name of <foreign lang="greek">προκοιτών</foreign>, in which the <seg lang="la">cubicularius</seg>, or valet, probably slept ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 23</bibl>). In some of the Pompeian houses we find a recess in which the bed was placed. This recess was called <seg lang="la">zotheca</seg> or <seg lang="la">zothecula.</seg></p>
 <p><title>(b) Triclinia</title>, dining-rooms, are treated of in a separate article. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstriclinium">Triclinium</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>(c) Oeci</title>, from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">οἶκος</foreign>, were spacious halls or saloons borrowed from the Greeks, and were frequently used as <seg lang="la">triclinia.</seg> (Cf. Plin. <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  184." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 184.</bibl>) They were to have the same proportions as <seg lang="la">triclinia</seg>, but were to be more spacious on account of having columns, which <seg lang="la">triclinia</seg> had not (Vitruv. vi. 5). Vitruvius mentions four kinds of <seg lang="la">oeci:</seg></p>
 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>) The <title>Tetrastyle</title>, which needs no further description. Four columns supported the roof.</p>
 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>) The <title>Corinthian</title>, which possessed only one 
<pb n="546" /><cb />
 row of columns, supporting the architrave (<seg lang="la">epistylium</seg>), cornice (<seg lang="la">corona</seg>), and a vaulted roof.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The <title>Egyptian</title>, which was more splendid and more like a basilica than a Corinthian <seg lang="la">triclinium.</seg> In the Egyptian <seg lang="la">oecus</seg>, the pillars supported a gallery with paved floor, which formed a walk round the apartment; and upon these pillars others were placed, a fourth part less in height than the lower, which surrounded the roof. Between the upper columns windows were inserted.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The <title>Cyzicene</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Κυζικηνός</foreign>) appears in the time of Vitruvius to have been seldom used in Italy. These were meant for summer use, looking to the north, and if possible facing gardens, to which they opened by folding-doors. Pliny had <seg lang="la">oeci</seg> of this kind in his villa.</p>
 <p><title>(e) Exedrae</title>, which appear to have been in form much the same as the <seg lang="la">oeci</seg>, for Vitruvius (vi. 5) speaks of the <seg lang="la">exedrae</seg> in connection with <seg lang="la">oeci quadrati</seg>, were rooms for conversation and the other purposes of society ( <title>De Nat. Deor.</title> i. 6, 15). They served the same purpose as the <seg lang="la">exedrae</seg> in the Thermae and Gymnasia, which were semicircular rooms with seats for philosophers and others to converse in. See <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">Balneae</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>(f, g, h) Pinacotheca, Bibliotheca</title>, and <title>Balineum</title> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">Balneae</ref>), are treated of in separate articles.
 </p>
 <p>(8) <title>Culina</title>, the kitchen.—The food was originally cooked in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, as has been already stated, but the progress of refinement afterwards led to the use of another part of the house for this purpose. In the kitchen of Pansa's house, of which a restoration is given below, a stove for stews and similar preparations was found, very much like the charcoal stoves used in the present day. Before it lie a knife, a strainer, and a kind of fryingpan with four spherical cavities, as if it were meant to cook eggs. <figure id="fig.00546">
<head orig="Culina, or Kitchen, in Pansa's House.">Culina, or Kitchen, in Pansa's House.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>In this kitchen, as well as in many others at Pompeii, there are paintings of the Lares and Penates, to whom the hearth in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> was sacred, and under whose care the kitchen was also placed (Arnob. ii. 67). In the country the meals were taken in the kitchen, as they were in ancient times in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> (Colum. i. 6). The kitchen was in the back part of the house, and in connection with it was the <seg lang="la">pistrinum</seg>, or bake-house, where bread was baked at home (Varr. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. p. 55<bibl n="Non.  18" default="NO" valid="yes">Non., 18</bibl>); but after B.C. 171 there were public bake-houses in Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspistor">Pistor</ref>.) In Pompeii have been found sinks of kitchens, called <seg lang="la">confluvia</seg> (Varr. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. p. 544<bibl n="Non.  20" default="NO" valid="yes">Non., 20</bibl>) or <seg lang="la">coquinae fusoria</seg> (Pallad. <title>R. R.</title> i. 37).</p>
 <p>In close and inconvenient proximity to the kitchen was the <seg lang="la">latrina</seg>, or privy, in order that a common drain might carry off the contents of both to the <seg lang="la">cloaca</seg> or public sewer (Varr. l. c.; Colum. x. <cb /> 85; cf. Plaut. <title>Curc.</title> iv. 4, 24;  <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 58" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tib.</title>58</bibl>;  <title>Met.</title>i. c. 17, p. 15). In many of the Pompeian houses we find the <seg lang="la">latrina</seg> contiguous to the kitchen, as is shown in the annexed cut from the house <figure id="fig.00546.2"><head>Culina and Latrina in the House of Sallust. (Gell, <title>Pompeiana</title>, p. 107.)</head></figure> of On the right are two small arches, which are the kitchen stove. On the left is an arched recess, which is the <seg lang="la">latrina.</seg> At the bottom is the mouth of a pipe supplying it with water.
 </p>
 <p>(9) <title>Cenacula</title>, or rooms in the upper stories, have been already explained.
 </p>
 <p>(10) <title>Lararium</title> or <title>Sacrarium.</title>—The Lares or Penates were originally placed near the hearth of the house in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, but when the latter became only a reception-room they were removed to a special chapel, called <title>Lararium</title> (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 29, 31) or <title>Sacrarium</title> ( <title>ad Fam.</title> xiii. 2), in which statues of other divinities were also placed. Such a chapel is found in the <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg> of many of the Pompeian houses.
 </p>
 <p>(11) <title>Diaeta</title> does not denote any particular kind of room, but is a word borrowed from the Greek (<foreign lang="greek">δίαιτα</foreign>) to signify a room used for any of the purposes of life ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 12</bibl>). Thus it denotes a bed-chamber ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 6. 16" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>vi. 16</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 14</bibl>), a dining-room (Sidon. Apoll. <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>ii. 2</bibl>), a summer-house or a room in a garden ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 20</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 7, 1, 66. 1; Orelli, <title>Inscr.</title> 4373, etc.). It is also the collective name of a set of chambers. Thus Pliny speaks ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 5. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>v. 6</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 31" default="NO" valid="yes"> H. N., 31</bibl>) of two <seg lang="la">diaetae</seg>, in one of which were four bed-chambers and in another three.
 </p>
 <p>(12) <title>Solarium</title>, literally a place for basking in the sun, denotes a terrace on the flat roof of a house, frequently used by the Romans, as is still the case in Italy and the East ( <bibl n="Isid.  15. 3" default="NO">Isid.xv. 3</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  12" default="NO">Isid., 12</bibl>; Plaut. <title>Mil. Glor.</title> ii. 3, 69; ii. 4, 25; <title>Claud.</title> 10). In the time of the emperors these <seg lang="la">solaria</seg> on the tops of houses were turned into gardens, which contained even fruit-trees and fish-ponds ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 122" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>122</bibl>). Somewhat similar were the <seg lang="la">solaria</seg> built by Nero on the colonnades in front of the <seg lang="la">insulae</seg> and <seg lang="la">domus</seg> ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 16" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>16</bibl>). Sometimes the <seg lang="la">solaria</seg> were covered by a roof (Orelli, <title>Inscr.</title> 2417).
 </p>
 <p>(13) <title>Cellae servorum, familiares</title> or <seg lang="la">familiaricae</seg>, the small bedrooms of the slaves, were usually situated in the upper story, as in the house of Pansa at Pompeii, or in the back of the house, with the exception of the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> of the house-porter, which naturally was close to the front door (Colum. i. 6;  <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>ii. 27</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 67" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Phil., 67</bibl>;  <bibl n="Enn.

 <p><title>Cella</title> also denoted the store-room, of which there 
<pb n="547" /><cb />
 were several, bearing various names, according to their contents. Of these an account is given under <ref type="cross" target="crosscella">Cella</ref>.</p>
 <p>Cellars underground and vaulted are rarely mentioned (<seg lang="la">hypogea concamerationesque</seg>, Vitruv. vi. [8] 11), though several have been found at Pompeii.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">V. Some Existing Remains of Roman Houses</hi>. —The oldest remains of a house in Rome are those of the Regia, which was the residence of the Pontifex Maximus and built on the site of the house occupied by Numa. It stood at the southeast limits of the Forum, adjoining the House of the Vestal Virgins. (See Dio Cass. xliii. 42, xliv. 17; <bibl n="Gel.  4. 6." default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.iv. 6.</bibl>) Another house which is also of interest from its early date is that known as “the House of Livia” or “of Germanicus,” which is built in a hollow in the northwestern part of the Palatine Hill. That it is probably not later in date than the time of Augustus is shown by the construction of its walls, which are formed of concrete faced with very neat <seg lang="la">opus reticulatum</seg> of tufa, no brick being used. The figure below shows its plan, which, owing to the irregularity of the site, is at two different levels, the small rooms grouped round the staircase F being at a much higher level than the larger rooms by the <seg lang="la">atrium:</seg> the stairs D lead from the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> up to the higher floor behind. The main entrance is at B, approached down a short flight of steps. C C are pedestals for a statue and an altar; E E are bedrooms; G is a narrow <seg lang="la">crypto-porticus</seg>, which branches out of H, another dark passage, forming hidden communications with different buildings on this part of the Palatine. A is a third vaulted passage which leads to Caligula's palace; this is possibly the path by which Caligula's murderers escaped when they hid themselves in the house of Germanicus (Joseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xix. 1, 2; <title>Calig.</title> 58).</p>
 <p>The paintings in the principal rooms of this house are among the finest examples of Roman wall decoration that still exist. See Renier, <title>Les Peintures du Palatin.</title></p>
 <p>The floors are formed of marble mosaic in simple geometrical patterns, very neatly fitted together, <figure id="fig.00547">

</figure> <cb /> with much smaller <seg lang="la">tesserae</seg> than were used under the later Empire.</p>
 <p>On the upper floor a long passage, approached by the staircase D, divides the house into two parts. J K L M seem to be small bath-rooms. N N are shops with no communication with the house, facing a public street, O O. At P are remains of a very ancient tufa building. Q is a <seg lang="la">piscina</seg>, which seems partly to have supplied the house with water. A number of inscribed lead pipes were found, but these were of later date than the house itself; water was laid on to the upper as well as to the ground floors.</p>
 <p>In 1874, remains of a very interesting house of the time of Augustus were found on the Esquiline Hill, not far from the Basilica of S. Maria Maggiore. From its position on the line of the Servian wall and <seg lang="la">agger</seg>, it has been called “the House of Maecenas,” who lived in that quarter, where he converted the public burial-ground into a large park ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 8" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 8</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 14" default="NO"> Sat., 14</bibl>). One fine room of this house, still well preserved, is of especial interest. It appears to have been a sort of greenhouse for plants and flowers, and is a large vaulted chamber, with a semicircular apse at one end. All round the walls are tiers of high steps once lined with marble, intended to form stands for rows of flower-pots—arranged exactly as in a modern conservatory. Prof. Mohr (<title>Bull. Inst. Arch.</title> for 1875) has pointed out that the cultivation of shrubs and flowers in this way was largely practised by the Romans. On each side of the hall are six recesses, decorated with paintings of garden scenes, with fountains among the flowers, treated in a skilfully deceptive way, so as to look as if each recess were a window opening upon a real garden. The light was admitted only through openings in the barrel-vault of the hall, on which were paintings of similar floral subjects—a remarkable example of the theatrical scene-painter's style of decoration which was popular among the Romans.</p>
 <p>The House of Sallust, the historian, was one of the finest houses in Rome. It had, like the House of Maecenas, extensive gardens, whence the residence was frequently called Horti Sallustiani. So large were the gardens that the emperor Aurelian, who preferred living there to the Palatine, erected in them a colonnade 1000 paces long, in which he took horse exercise. Part of this house still exists in the narrow valley between the Pincian and Quirinal Hills, near the Porta Collina in the Servian wall. The following figure shows the plan of the existing remains, which will be soon destroyed by the filling up of the valley where the building stands to make new boulevards—a most serious loss. The circular part A is a lofty domed hall; B B is a balconylike gallery, supported on corbels, which runs round the outside of the main building, at a height of about forty feet above the ground; C is a fine vaulted room, with two stories over it; D D is a retaining wall, built against the scarped face of the cliff to keep the crumbling tufa rock from decay; E E are rooms in four or five 
<pb n="548" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00548">

</figure>
 stories, some with concrete and others with wooden floors; F are winding marble-lined stairs, with mosaic landings, which led to the top of the house and the rooms on the higher level of the hill. This part is still about seventy feet high. G is another marble-lined staircase. A great part of the house is still unexcavated. The date of the existing portion is of the first century A.D., and is evidently part of additions made by the early emperors. In the sixteenth century an immense quantity of valuable marbles, including magnificent columns of Oriental alabaster and Numidian stone, were found in the ruins of Sallust's house and used to decorate several of the churches of Rome.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">VI. Pompeian Houses</hi>.—Though of course less magnificent than the palaces of Rome, the houses of Pompeii, from their exceptionally perfect state of preservation, are of especial value as examples of Roman domestic architecture, and have the advantage of being in most cases of known date. Few are older than the Christian era, and none of course are later than A.D. 79, when the city was overwhelmed by the eruption of Vesuvius. The existing remains show us, as a rule, only the ground-floor of each house; and it should be remembered that a number of the best rooms—especially, there is reason to believe, the bedrooms and the women's apartments—were on the upper floors. The presence of stairs in apparently all the houses proves that one-storied buildings were practically unknown in Pompeii; the few fragments of the upper story which have been found standing show that, in some cases at least, the <figure id="fig.00548.2">
<head orig="Atrium of the House of the Quaestor. (Pompeii.)">Atrium of the House of the Quaestor. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> upper part of the house was partly constructed of wood, and was arranged so as to project beyond the line of the lower story, very like the half-timbered houses of England and France in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>
 <p>In one respect the Pompeian arrangement resembled that of mediaeval and modern Italy; that is, the street-front on the ground-floor, even of large and handsome houses, was usually occupied by a row of shops. In some cases these shops have no doorway or passage communicating with the main house, and were probably rented by the owner to independent tradesmen; in others the shops could be entered from the house, and in these cases we may suppose that the shops were managed by the slaves or clients of the house-owner.</p>
 <p>The accompanying plan shows a small shop, to which is joined the residence of its owner, <figure id="fig.00548.3">
<head orig="Plan of House with Shop.">Plan of House with Shop.</head>
</figure> forming a small block independent of the adjoining larger house. (1) An open archway, in which a wooden shopfront was fitted; the threshold of this opening is rebated to receive the wooden partition, part of which was hinged so as to form a narrow door; the upper part would be closed at night by flap-shutters hinged at the top, an arrangement very like that of a modern Oriental bazaar. This method of constructing shop-fronts was very common, not only in Pompeii, but in Rome and elsewhere. The presence of a shop appears always to be indicated by this long grooved sill, with marks of the hinged door on one side. A large number of examples still exist in Rome. The <hi rend="bold">L-</hi>shaped counter</p>
 <p>(2) is formed of concrete and brick stuccoed; in it are inserted a row of <seg lang="la">amphorae</seg>, apparently for the reception of hot food or drink of some kind. At one end is a charcoal stove</p>
 <p>(3); 5, 5 are the dining-room and store-room of the shopkeeper; 4 is the staircase leading to the sleeping apartments. The whole forms a complete house of the smallest type.</p>
 <p>The two illustrations annexed represent two <seg lang="la">atria</seg> of houses at Pompeii. The first is the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> 
<pb n="549" /><cb />
 of what is usually called the “House of the Quaestor.” The view is taken near the entrance-hall facing the <seg lang="la">tablinum</seg>, through which the columns of the peristyle and the garden are seen. This <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, which is a specimen of what Vitruvius calls the Corinthian, is surrounded by various rooms, and is beautifully painted with arabesque designs upon red and yellow grounds.</p>
 <p>The next illustration represents the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> of what is usually called the “House of Ceres.” In <figure id="fig.00549">
<head orig="Atrium of the House of Ceres. (Restoration.)">Atrium of the House of Ceres. (Restoration.)</head>
</figure> the centre is the <seg lang="la">impluvium;</seg> and, as there are no pillars around the <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg>, this <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> must belong to the kind called by Vitruvius the “Tuscan.”</p>
 <p>The three following plans are good typical examples of the best class of houses in Pompeii. The first is popularly known as “the House of the Tragic Poet.” <figure id="fig.00549.2">
<head orig="House of the Tragic Poet.">House of the Tragic Poet.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Like most of the other houses at Pompeii, it had no <seg lang="la">vestibulum</seg> according to the meaning which we <figure id="fig.00549.3">
<head orig="Pompeian Mosaic. (Overbeck.)">Pompeian Mosaic. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> have attached to the word. The <seg lang="la">ostium</seg>, or entrancehall, which is six feet wide, is nearly thirty long—a length occasioned by the shops on each side. Near the street-door there is a figure of <cb /> a large fierce dog worked in mosaic on the pavement, and beneath it is written <title>Cave Canem</title>, as here shown. The two large rooms on each side of the vestibule appear from the large openings in front of them to have been shops; they communicate with the entrance-hall, and were therefore probably occupied by the master of the house. The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> is about twenty-eight feet in length and twenty in breadth; its <seg lang="la">impluvium</seg> is near the centre of the room, and its floor is paved with white <seg lang="la">tesserae</seg>, spotted with black. On the left-hand corner of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> is a small room (marked 1 in plan), perhaps the <seg lang="la">cella</seg> of the <seg lang="la">ostiarius</seg>, with a staircase leading to the upper rooms. On each side of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> are chambers for the use of the family or intended for the reception of guests, who were entitled to claim hospitality. When a house did not possess a <seg lang="la">hospitium</seg> (q. v.), or rooms expressly for the reception of guests, they appear to have been lodged in rooms attached to the <seg lang="la">atrium.</seg> At the farther end of the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> is the <seg lang="la">tablinum</seg>, with the <seg lang="la">fauces</seg>, or passage, at the side, leading into the <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg>, with Doric columns and garden (<hi rend="italic">viridarium</hi>). The large room on the right of the peristyle is the <seg lang="la">triclinium;</seg> beside it is the kitchen, with a <seg lang="la">latrina.</seg></p>
 <p>The second illustration contains the groundplan of an <seg lang="la">insula</seg> surrounded by shops, which belonged to the owner and were let by him. The house itself, which is usually called the “House of Pansa,” evidently belonged to one of the principal men of Pompeii. Including the garden, which <figure id="fig.00549.4">

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">VII. General Details of Roman Houses</hi>.— (1) <title>Walls.</title>—The wall (<seg lang="la">paries</seg>) in earlier times was made of some easily worked stone, such as tufa or peperino in large square blocks; or for the best houses unburnt brick was used. In the time of Augustus concrete began to be the chief building material, and later kiln-dried bricks. The inner walls were originally whitewashed (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdealbatores">Dealbatores</ref>), and later were covered with stucco (<seg lang="la">opus albarium</seg>). The plain surface of the walls was broken by quadrangular panels, called <seg lang="la">abaci</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  159" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 159</bibl>; xxxv. 3<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. H. N., 32</bibl>). (See, also, <ref type="cross" target="crossabacus">Abacus</ref>.) In the second century B.C., the practice was introduced from Greece of painting these panels with an endless variety of figures, landscapes, buildings, gardens, etc., of which we have numerous examples in the existing remains of houses in Rome and Pompeii. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspictura">Pictura</ref>. <cb /></p>
 <p>In addition to painting, other methods of decoration were used: in Rome especially the chief way of ornamenting the rooms of the best houses was by lining the walls with slabs of sawn marble, moulded into a skirting below and a cornice above. Great magnificence of effect was produced by the skilful admixture of marbles of different rich colours, the moulded part being usually of a deeper tint than the flat surfaces. In the most careful work these marble linings were fastened to the walls by bronze clamps, but more often the slabs were simply attached by a thick bedding of cement behind them ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 86. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>86. 4</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Another very rich method of decoration was the application of stucco reliefs enriched with gold and colours. A third system, applied also to vaults, was to encrust the walls with mosaics, <figure id="fig.00550">
<head orig="Specimen of Decorative Wall-painting at Pompeii. (Reber.)">Specimen of Decorative Wall-painting at Pompeii. (Reber.)</head>
</figure> chiefly made of glass <seg lang="la">tesserae</seg> of the most brilliant jewel-like colours. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmusivum-opus">Musivum Opus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In fact, splendour of effect and a brilliant <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> were the characteristics of Roman house-decoration from the Augustan era down to later times.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>Roofs.</title>—The roofs (<seg lang="la">tecta</seg>) of Roman houses were in the oldest times covered with straw. Next came the use of shingles for the roofing of houses, which continued down to the time of the war with Pyrrhus ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 16.  36" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xvi. 36</bibl>). Subsequently clay tiles, called <seg lang="la">tegulae</seg> and <seg lang="la">imbrices</seg>, superseded the shingles. The roofs of houses were sometimes flat, but they were also gabled (<hi rend="italic">pectenata</hi>) like modern houses. These were of two kinds, the <seg lang="la">tecta pectenata</seg>, sloping two ways, and the <seg lang="la">tecta testudinata</seg>, sloping four ways ( Fest. p. 213, M). Both kinds of roofs were <hi rend="italic">displuviata</hi>—that is, sloping towards the street—and the houses had around 
<pb n="551" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00551">
<head orig="Roof in Peristyle of the House of C. Vibius. (Overbeck.)">Roof in Peristyle of the House of C. Vibius. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure>
 them an <seg lang="la">ambitus</seg>, or vacant space of 2 1/2 feet, to receive the rain-water running off the roofs. The projecting eaves of roofs were called <seg lang="la">suggrundae.</seg> The gabled roofs rose to a point called <seg lang="la">fastigium</seg> (q. v.). For the most magnificent buildings, such as some of the imperial palaces, the roofs were covered with tiles made of white marble, or even with bronze tiles plated with gold. For further details, see <ref type="cross" target="crosstegula">Tegula</ref>.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Floors.</title>—The floor (<seg lang="la">solum</seg>) of a room was seldom boarded (<seg lang="la">strata solo tabulata</seg>,  <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 1. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>i. 5</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 57</bibl>), except in the upper stories. The floor on the ground-floor was usually of stone, and, in the case of common houses, consisted of small pieces of stone, brick, tiles, etc. (<seg lang="la">ruderatio, opus ruderatum</seg>), beaten down (<seg lang="la">pavita</seg>) with a rammer (<seg lang="la">fistuca</seg>), whence the word <seg lang="la">pavimentum</seg> became the general name for a floor ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  185" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 185</bibl> foll.). Sometimes the floors were paved with thin slabs of richly-coloured marbles, brought from Northern Africa, Arabia, or Greece (Tibull. iii. 3, 16;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 86" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>86</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 6</bibl>; Pallad. i. 9), and still more frequently with mosaics (<seg lang="la">opus musivum</seg>). See <ref type="cross" target="crosspavimentum">Pavimentum</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossmusivum-opus">Musivum Opus</ref>.</p>
 <p>In Rome and other parts of Italy, owing to the wonderful strength of the <hi rend="italic">pozzolana</hi>, the upper floors of houses were very frequently made of concrete cast in one great slab on temporary boarding, fixed at the required level. This set into one compact mass, like a piece of solid stone. On this, mosaic and other paving was laid, as on the ground-floors.</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Ceilings.</title>—Ceilings were very commonly semicircular or “barrel” vaults (<seg lang="la">camarae</seg>), decorated with stucco reliefs, mosaics, or painting. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscamara">Camara</ref>.) The <hi rend="italic">extrados</hi> of the vault was filled in level with concrete to form the floor above. Wooden ceilings and flat concrete ceilings were decorated in the same way. One common method of ceiling decoration, applied both to brick and concrete or to wooden ceilings, was to divide the whole area into a number of deeply sunk panels, like pits or lakes (<seg lang="la">lacus, lacunae</seg>), whence they were called <seg lang="la">lacunaria</seg> or <hi rend="italic">laquearia.</hi> These were richly ornamented, either by stucco reliefs gilt and coloured, or, in the case of wooden ceilings, by inlaid work of ivory, ebony, or other precious materials as well as by paintings. In a few cases the “coffers” were covered with enriched bronze plates, thickly gilt. <cb /></p>
 <p>(5) <title>Windows.</title>—The Roman houses had few windows (<seg lang="la">fenestrae</seg>). The <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> and <seg lang="la">peristylium</seg> were lighted, as we have seen, from above, and the smaller rooms leading out of them generally derived their light from them and not from windows looking into the street. The rooms only on the upper stories (<seg lang="la">cenacula</seg>) seem to have been usually lighted by windows, and looked out upon the street as well as the inner courts. Hence they are frequently mentioned by the ancient writers (<bibl n="Liv.  1. 41" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, i. 41</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  24. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxiv. 21</bibl>;  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 25</bibl>; Propert. iv. [v.], 7, 16; <bibl n="Juv.  3. 270" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 270</bibl>). In Pompeii, in like manner, the ground-floor rooms were mostly lighted from the inner courts, so that few lower windows opened on the street. There is an exception to this in the “House of the Tragic Poet,” which has six windows on the ground-floor. Even in this case, however, the windows are not near the ground, as in a modern house, but are six feet six inches above the foot-pavement, which is raised one foot seven inches above the centre of the street. The windows are small, being hardly three feet by two; and at the side there is a wooden frame, in which the window or shutter might be moved backwards or forwards. The lower part of the wall is occu<figure id="fig.00551.2">
<head orig="Pompeian Fenestra or Window. (Overbeck.)">Pompeian Fenestra or Window. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> pied by a row of red panels four feet and a half high. The following illustration represents part of the wall, with the apertures for windows above it, as it appears from the street. The tiling upon the wall is modern, and is only placed there to preserve it from the weather. <figure id="fig.00551.3">
<head orig="Wall with Apertures for the Windows in a House at Pompeii.">Pompeian Fenestra or Window. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>There has been much discussion whether glass windows were known to the ancients; but in the excavations at Pompeii many fragments of flat glass have been discovered, and in the <seg lang="la">tepidarium</seg> of the public baths a bronze lattice was found 
<pb n="552" /><cb />
 with some of the panes still inserted in the frame (Gell, <title>Pompeiana</title>, i. p. 99). (See <ref type="cross" target="crossvitrum">Vitrum</ref>.) Besides glass, other transparent substances were also used, such as talc, the <seg lang="la">lapis specularis</seg> of Pliny. Windows made of this were called <seg lang="la">specularia</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 90" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>90</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 25</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(6) <title>Doors.</title>—The subject of doors, with their locks and keys, is discussed under <ref type="cross" target="crossianua">Ianua</ref> and <ref type="cross" target="crossclavis">Clavis</ref>. It is only necessary to mention here that many of the rooms in Roman houses had no doors, but only curtains, <seg lang="la">vela, aulaea, centones</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 80" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>80</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl>; <bibl n="Petron.  7" default="NO">Petron.7</bibl>; Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 4, <title>Heliog.</title> 14). Sometimes, when there were doors, curtains were also drawn across them. See <ref type="cross" target="crossvelum">Velum</ref>.
 </p>
 <p>(7) <title>The Heating of Houses.</title>—The rooms were heated in winter in different ways. The <seg lang="la">cubicula, triclinia</seg>, and other rooms which were intended for winter use, were built in that part of the house upon which the sun shone most; and in the mild climate of Italy this frequently enabled them to dispense with any artificial mode of warming the rooms. Rooms exposed to the sun in this way were sometimes called <seg lang="la">heliocamini</seg> ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 20" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 20</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 8, 2, 17). The rooms were occasionally heated by hot air, which was introduced by means of pipes from a furnace below ( <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>ii. 17</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 5. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., v. 6</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. Ep., 24</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 90" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>90</bibl>), but more frequently in earlier times by portable furnaces or braziers (<seg lang="la">foculi</seg>), in <figure id="fig.00552">
<head orig="Bronze Braziers from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Bronze Braziers from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> which charcoal was burned. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfocus">Focus</ref>.) The <seg lang="la">caminus</seg>, however, was a fixed stove, in which wood appears to have been usually burned ( <title>Vitell.</title> 8;  <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 5" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 5</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 81" default="NO"> Sat., 81</bibl>; <bibl n="Plin.

Ep. 2. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>ii. 2</bibl>). It has been a subject of much dispute among modern writers whether the Romans had chimneys for carrying off the smoke, except in the baths and kitchens. From many passages in ancient writers it certainly appears that rooms usually had no chimneys, but that the smoke escaped through the windows, doors, and openings in the roof (Vitruv. vii. 3, 4); but chimneys do not appear to have been entirely unknown to the ancients, as some have been found in the ruins of ancient buildings, and it is impossible to believe that among a luxurious people like the Romans in imperial times, they were unacquainted with the use of chimneys.

 <p>(8) <title>The water supply</title> of a good Roman house was very complete; in towns the main usually ran under the pavement in the middle of the street, and from it “rising mains” branched off to the houses right and left, and often were carried to the upper stories, where a cistern supplied the fountainjets (<seg lang="la">salientes</seg>) and other purposes below.

<head orig="Donatio Inter Virum et Uxōrem">Donatio Inter Virum et Uxorem</head>

 <p> By the Roman law, during marriage, neither husband nor wife could, as a general rule, make a gift of anything to one another. This rule would, however, only apply where there was no <seg lang="la">conventio in manum;</seg> for in such a case the rule of law would be unnecessary, because a gift between husband and wife would be legally impossible. The reason for this rule was said to be the preservation of the marriage relation in its purity, as a contract subsisting by affection, and not maintained by purchase or by gift from one party to the other. The reason seems a singular one, but it is that which is given by the Roman writers. It has apparently a tacit reference to the power of divorce, and appears like an implied recommendation of it when the conjugal affection ceases. Donationes of this kind were, however, valid when there were certain considerations, as <seg lang="la">mortis causa, divortii causa, servi manumittendi gratia.</seg> By certain imperial constitutions, a 
<pb n="553" /><cb />
 woman could make gifts to her husband in order to qualify him for certain honours. It must be remembered that when there was no <seg lang="la">conventio in manum</seg>, a wife retained all her rights of property which she did not surrender on her marriage (see Dos), and she might, during the marriage, hold property quite distinct from her husband. It was a consequence of this rule as to gifts between husband and wife that every legal form by which the gift was affected to be transferred, as <seg lang="la">mancipatio, cessio</seg>, and <seg lang="la">traditio</seg>, conveyed no ownership; stipulations were not binding, and <hi rend="italic">acceptilationes</hi> were no release.

<div2 id="crossdonatio-mortis-causa" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Donatio Mortis Causa">Donatio Mortis Causa</head>

 <p> There were in Roman law three kinds of <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa:</seg> (1) When a man, under no present apprehension of danger, but moved solely by a consideration of human mortality, makes a gift to another.</p>
 <p>(2) When a man, being in immediate danger, makes a gift to another in such a manner that the thing immediately becomes the property of the donee.</p>
 <p>(3) When a man, under the like circumstances, gives a thing in such a manner that it shall become the property of the donee in case the giver dies. Every person could receive such a gift who was capable of receiving a legacy.</p>
 <p>It appears, then, that there were several forms of gift called <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa;</seg> but the third seems the only proper one, and that of which mention is chiefly made, for it was a rule of law that a donation of this kind was not perfected unless death followed, and it was revocable by the donor. A thing given absolutely could hardly be a <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa</seg>, for this <seg lang="la">donatio</seg> had a condition attached to it—namely, the death of the donor and the survivorship of the donee. The thing might be a thing capable of <seg lang="la">traditio</seg>, or delivery, or it might be a promise of a sum of money to be paid after the death of the testator. It would appear as if the law about such donations was not free from difficulty. They were finally assimilated to legacies in all respects by Justinian, though this had been done in some particulars before his time. Still they differed in some respects from legacies, for such a donation could take effect though there was no <seg lang="la">heres;</seg> and a filius familias, who could not make a will, might, with his father's consent, make a <seg lang="la">donatio mortis causa.</seg>

 <p> signifies in Roman law that which is given by a husband or by any other person to a woman on the occasion of her marriage, whether it be by way of security for her dowry or for her support during the marriage or widowhood. Justinian required this <seg lang="la">donatio</seg> whenever the wife brought a dowry; and it was enacted that it should be equal in amount to the dowry, and should be increased when the dowry was increased. Such a gift was the property of the wife, but it was managed by the husband, and he was bound to apply it to its proper purposes; but he could not alienate it, even with the consent of the wife (<title>Cod.</title> v. 3).

 <p> A present of money made to Roman soldiers. In the republican age donatives were distributed on the occasion of a triumph, the expense being defrayed out of the money raised by selling the spoil. Under the Empire it was usual for the emperor to grant a <seg lang="la">donativum</seg> on his accession. Tiberius on this occasion made a present of some $3,750,000 to the army; and the sum increased in <cb /> later reigns.

<div2 id="crossdonatus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Donātus">Donatus</head>

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossaelius">Aelius</ref>. A celebrated grammarian, born in the fourth century of our era, about A.D. 333. He was preceptor to St. Jerome, who speaks with great approbation of his talents and of the manner in which he explained the comedies of Terence. Independently of his commentaries on Vergil and Terence, Donatus composed a treatise (<title>Ars Donati Grammatici Urbis Romae</title>) in two parts. In one (<title>Ars Minor</title>) he treats of the eight parts of speech only, and in the other (<title>Ars Maior</title>), deals with grammar more elaborately. This work was highly esteemed and so much used in the Middle Ages that the word <seg lang="la">donat</seg> (Chaucer) became the generic term for a grammar. The commentary on Vergil appears to have been worthy neither of the author commented on nor of the reputation of the grammarian to whom it is ascribed, if we may judge from the contemptuous allusions made to it by Servius; but of it only the preface and the introduction (<seg lang="la">enarrationes</seg>) are now extant, besides quotations given in Servius. The commentary on Terence, however, is extremely valuable, though we have it in a form different from that which it originally possessed. The chief MS. of the commentaries of Donatus is one at Paris of the eleventh century. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> appeared at Rome in 1472. The text of the  <title>Ars</title>is contained in Keil's <title>Grammatici Latini</title>, vol. iv. <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1856- 1880)</bibl>. See Gräfenhan, <title>Geschichte d. class.

 <p>(2) Not to be confounded with the preceding is <hi rend="SmallCaps">Tiberius Claudius Donatus</hi>, who wrote <title>Interpretationes</title> on the <title>Aeneid</title>, probably in the fourth century. Of the author, nothing is known. The work, which is preceded by a short epistle, was first published at Naples in 1535, and is included in the editions of Vergil by Fabricius <bibl default="NO">(Basle, 1561)</bibl>, and Lucius <bibl default="NO">(Basle, 1613)</bibl>. See Ribbeck's Prolegomena to Vergil, 185; and Burkas, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Ti. Claud. Donati in Aen. Commentario</title> (Jena, 1889)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(3) A bishop of Numidia, in the fourth century. According to some writers he was the founder of the sect of Donatists, which grew out of a schism produced by the election of a bishop of Carthage. He was deposed and excommunicated in councils held at Rome and at Arles in the years A.D. 313 and 314, but was for some time after supported by a party at home. His end is unknown.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δῶρις</foreign>). (1) A small and mountainous country in Greece, formerly called Dryopis, bounded by Thessaly on the north, by Aetolia on the west, by Locris on the south, and by Phocis on the east. It contained four towns —Boum, Citinium, Erineus, and Pindus—which formed the Dorian tetrapolis. These towns never attained any consequence; but the country is of importance as the home of the Dorians (<foreign lang="greek">Δωριεῖς</foreign>), one of the great Hellenic races, who conquered Peloponnesus. It was related that Aegimius, king of the Dorians, had been driven from his dominions by the Lapithae, but was reinstated by Heracles; that the children of Heracles hence took refuge in this land when they had been expelled from the Peloponnesus; and that it was to restore them to their rights that the Dorians invaded the Peloponnesus. Accordingly, the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians is usually called the Return of the Heraclidae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossheraclidae">Heraclidae</ref>.) The Dorians were divided into three tribes: the Hylleis, Pamphyli, and Dymanes. They were the ruling class throughout the Peloponnesus; the old inhabitants were reduced to slavery, or became subjects of the Dorians under the name of Perioeci (<foreign lang="greek">Περίοικοι</foreign>).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δωσίθεος</foreign>). A grammarian who flourished towards the end of the fourth century A.D. He wrote a Latin grammar for Greek boys, with a literal Greek translation, which was not fully completed. With this was bound up (whether by Dositheus himself is uncertain) a miscellany of very various contents by another author. This comprises (1) anecdotes of the emperor Hadrian;</p>
 <p>(2) fables of Aesop;</p>
 <p>(3) an important chapter on jurisprudence;</p>
 <p>(4) mythological stories from Hyginus;</p>
 <p>(5) an abridgment of the Iliad;</p>
 <p>(6) an interesting collection of words and phrases from ordinary conversation, styled <foreign lang="greek">Ἑρμηνεύματα</foreign>. The Latin grammar has the Greek translation inserted in the Latin text, thus: <foreign lang="greek"> <title>αρς</title>τέχνη</foreign> <seg lang="la">grammatica</seg> <foreign lang="greek">γραμματική</foreign> <seg lang="la">est</seg> <foreign lang="greek">ἐστίν</foreign> <seg lang="la">scientia</seg> <foreign lang="greek">γνῶσις</foreign>. The Latin is the text of a grammar now lost, Dositheus making only the Greek translation. A separate edition of the grammar is that of Keil <bibl default="NO">(Halle, 1869-71)</bibl>.

<head orig="Drachma">Drachma</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δραχμή</foreign>). The name of a weight and of a denomination of coin among the Greeks. As weight and as coin it was the hundredth part of the <seg lang="la">mina</seg>, and was divided into six lesser units called <foreign lang="greek">ὀβολοί</foreign>. The ancients (<title>Etym. Mag.</title> s. v. <foreign lang="greek">ὀβελίσκος</foreign>) connected the word with <foreign lang="greek">δράσσομαι</foreign>, “I grasp,” and <foreign lang="greek">δράγμα</foreign>, “a handful,” and supposed that a drachm was originally the value in silver of a handful of six <foreign lang="greek">ὀβολοί</foreign>, or wedge-shaped pieces of metal, which circulated as money. It is, however, very doubtful if this derivation is not a mere fancy; it is far more probable that <foreign lang="greek">δραχμή</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">δαρεικός</foreign>, is connected with the Persian word <hi rend="italic">darag</hi>, “a part,” since the weight of the drachma seems to be derived by division of the <seg lang="la">mina</seg>, rather than the weight of the mina to be produced by multiplication of the drachma.</p>
 <p>The ordinary denominations of Greek coins were: for gold, the didrachma (double drachma), drachma, hemi-drachma, and smaller divisions; for silver, the same, with the addition of the tetra-drachma, and occasionally of the decadrachma. The weight of the drachma varied according to the standard to which it belonged; the heaviest drachma was the Aeginetan of 96 grains, worth in silver rather more <figure id="fig.00555">

<head orig="Draco">Draco</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Δράκων</foreign>). A very celebrated Athenian legislator, who flourished about B.C. 621. Suidas tells us that he brought forward his code of laws (<foreign lang="greek">θεσμοί</foreign>) in this year, and that he was then an old man. Aristotle ( <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>ii.</bibl><hi rend="italic">fin.</hi>) says that Draco adapted his laws to the existing constitution, and that they contained nothing particular beyond the severity of their penalties. The slightest theft was punished capitally, as well as the most atrocious murder; and Demades remarked of his laws that they <cb /> were written with blood, and not with ink ( <title>Solon</title>, 17). Draco, however, deserves credit as the first who introduced written laws at Athens; and it is probable that he improved the criminal courts by his transfer of cases of bloodshed from the archon to the ephetae, since before his time the archons had a right of settling all cases arbitrarily and without appeal—a right which they enjoyed in other cases until Solon's time. It appears that there were some offences which he did not punish with death; for instance, loss of civil rights was the punishment of attempting to alter one of his laws (Demosth. <title>c. Aristocr.</title> p. 714, Bekker). Draco was an archon (Pausan. ix. 36, 8), and, consequently, an Eupatrid; it is not, therefore, to be supposed that his object was to favour the lower orders, though his code seems to have tended to abridge the power of the nobles. The Athenians, it is said, could not endure the rigour of his laws, and the legislator himself was obliged to withdraw to the island of Aegina. Here he is said by Suidas to have been suffocated in the theatre beneath the number of cloaks and garments which the people of the island, according to the usual mode of expressing approbation among the Greeks, showered upon him. He was buried in the theatre.

<head orig="Drama">Drama</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">δρᾶμα</foreign>). <hi rend="SmallCaps">In Athens</hi> the production of plays was a State affair, not a private undertaking. It formed a great part of the religious festival of the Dionysia, in which the drama took its rise (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>); and it was only at the Greater Dionysia that pieces could be performed during the author's lifetime. The performances lasted three days and took the form of musical contests, the competitors being three tragic poets, with their tetralogies, and five comic poets, with one piece each. The authority who superintended the whole was the archon, to whom the poets had to bring their plays for reading and apply for a chorus. If the pieces were accepted and the chorus granted, the citizens who were liable for the <hi rend="italic">choregia</hi> undertook at their own cost to practise and furnish for them one chorus each. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossliturgia">Liturgia</ref>.) The poets whose plays were accepted received a reward from the State. The State also supplied the regular number of actors, and made provision for the maintenance of order during the performances. At the end of the performance a certain number of persons (usually five) were chosen by lot from a committee (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγωνοθέται</foreign>) nominated by the Senate to award the prizes, and bound by solemn oath to give their judgment on the plays, the <hi rend="italic">choregi</hi>, and the actors. The poet who won the first prize was presented with a crown in the presence of the assembled multitude—the highest distinction that could be conferred on a dramatic author at Athens. The victorious <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> also received a crown, with the permission to dedicate a votive offering to Dionysus. This was generally a tripod, which was set up either in the theatre or in the temple of the deity or in the Street of Tripods, so named from this custom, an inscription being put on it recording the event, as in that of Panofka, <title>Musée Blacas</title>, pl. I. (British Museum): <foreign lang="greek">Ακαμαντὶς ἐνίκα φυλή</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">Γλαύκων καλός</foreign>. The actors in the successful play received prizes of money, besides the usual <seg lang="la">honoraria.</seg></p>
 <p>From the time of Sophocles the actors in a play were three in number. They had to represent all the parts, those of women included. This involved changing their costume several times during the performance. The three actors were distinguished as <hi rend="italic">protagonistes, deuteragonistes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">tritagonistes</hi>, according to the importance of their parts. If the piece required a fourth actor, which was seldom the case, the <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> had to provide one. The <hi rend="italic">choregus</hi> had also to see to the position and equipment of the mute actors.</p>
 <p>In earlier times it is possible that the persons engaged in the representation did not make a business of their art, but performed gratuitously, as the poets down to the time of Sophocles appeared upon the <cb /> stage. But the dramatic art gradually became a profession requiring careful preparation, and winning general respect for its members as artists. The chief requirements for the profession were distinctness and correctness of pronunciation, especially in declamatory passages, and an unusual power of memory, as there was no prompter in a Greek theatre. An actor had also to be thoroughly trained in singing, melodramatic action, dancing, and play of gesture. The latter was especially necessary, as the use of masks precluded any facial expression. The actors were according to strict rule assigned to the poets by lot; yet a poet generally had his special protagonist, on whose peculiar gifts he kept his eye in writing the dramatic pieces.</p>
 <p>The Athenian tragedies began to be known all over the Hellenic world as early as the time of Aeschylus. The first city outside of Attica that had a theatre was Syracuse, where Aeschylus brought out some of his own plays. Scenic contests soon began to form part of the religious festivals in various Greek cities, and were celebrated in honour of other deities besides Dionysus. It was a habit of Alexander the Great to celebrate almost every considerable event with dramatic exhibitions, and after him this became the regular custom. A considerable increase in the number of actors was one consequence of the new demand. The actors called themselves artists of Dionysus, and in the larger cities they formed permanent societies (<foreign lang="greek">σύνοδοι</foreign>) with special privileges, including exemption from military service and security in person and property. These companies had a regular organization, presided over by a priest of their patron-god Dionysus, annually elected from among their members. A treasurer and officers completed the staff. At the time of the festivals the societies sent out their members in groups of three actors, with a manager and a flute-player, to the different cities. This business was especially lively in Ionia and on the Euxine, the societies of Teos being the most distinguished. The same arrangement was adopted in Italy, and continued to exist under the Roman Empire.</p>
 <p>The universal employment of masks was a remarkable peculiarity of costume. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspersona">Persona</ref>.) It naturally excluded all play of feature, but the masks corresponded to the general types of character, as well as to the special types indicated by the requirements of the play. Certain conventionalities <figure id="fig.00556">
<head orig="Masking-room of a Greek Theatre.">Masking-room of a Greek Theatre.</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="557" /><cb /> were observed in the colour of the hair. Goddesses and young persons had light hair; gods and persons of riper age, dark brown; aged persons, white; and the deities of the lower world, black. The height of the masks and top-knots varied with the age of the actors and the parts they took. Lucian ridicules the “chest-paddings and stomach-paddings” of the tragic actors (<title>De Salt.</title> 27). Their stature was considerably heightened in tragedies by the high boot (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscothurnus">Cothurnus</ref>), and the defects in proportion corrected by padding and the use of a kind of gloves. The conventionalities of costume, probably as fixed by <figure id="fig.00557">
<head orig="(1) Mask of Perseus with Cap of Darkness. (2) Pompeian Mask.">(1) Mask of Perseus with Cap of Darkness. (2) Pompeian Mask.</head>
</figure> Aeschylus, maintained themselves as long as Greek tragedies were performed at all. Men and women of high rank wore on the stage a variegated or richly embroidered long-sleeved <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign>, reaching to the feet, and fastened with a girdle as high as the breast. The upper garment, whether <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάτιον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">χλαμύς</foreign>, was long and splendid, and often embroidered with gold. Kings and queens had a purple train and a white <foreign lang="greek">ἱμάτιον</foreign> with a purple border; soothsayers, a netted upper garment reaching to the feet. Persons in misfortune, especially fugitives, appeared in soiled garments of gray, green, or blue; black was the symbol of mourning. <figure id="fig.00557.2">
<head orig="Comedy Scene. (Painting from Pompeii.)">(1) Mask of Perseus with Cap of Darkness. (2) Pompeian Mask.</head>
</figure> <cb /> Soothsayers always wore a woollen garment of network; shepherds, a short leathern tunic; while each of the gods had some distinguishing mark, as the bow for Apollo, the caduceus for Hermes, the aegis for Athené. So with the well-known heroes: Heracles bore a club; Perseus, the cap of darkness. Kings wore a crown, and carried a sceptre. Warriors appeared in complete armour. Old men bore a staff with a curved handle, introduced by Sophocles. Messengers who brought good news were crowned with olive or laurel. Myrtle crowns denoted festivity. Foreigners wore some one special badge, as a Persian turban for Darius ( <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 661" default="NO" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title>661</bibl>). From the time of Euripides, heroes in misfortune (e. g. Telephus and Philoctetes) were sometimes dressed in rags.</p>
 <p>In the Satyric Drama the costumes of the heroic characters resembled in all essentials what they wore in the tragedies, although, to suit the greater liveliness of the action, the <foreign lang="greek">χιτών</foreign> was shorter and the boot lower. In the Old Comedy the costumes were taken as nearly as possible from actual life, but in the Middle and New Comedy they were conventional. The men wore a white coat; youths, a purple one; slaves, a motley, with mantle to match; cooks, an unbleached double mantle; peasants, a fur or shaggy coat, with wallet and staff; panders, a coloured coat and motley overgarment. Old women appeared in sky-blue or dark yellow; priestesses and maidens, in white; courtesans, in motley colours, and so on. Red hair marked a roguish slave; beards were not given to youths or old men. The eyebrows were strongly marked and highly characteristic. When drawn up, they denoted pride or impudence. A touchy old man had one eyebrow drawn up and one down. The members of the chorus were masked and dressed in a costume corresponding to the part assigned them by the poet. (On their dress in the Satyric Drama, see <ref type="cross" target="crosssatyric-drama">Satyric Drama</ref>.) The chorus of the comedy caricatured the ordinary dress of the tragic 
<pb n="558" /><cb />
 chorus. Sometimes they represented animals, as in the  <title>Frogs</title>and  <title>Birds</title>of Aristophanes. In the  <title>Frogs</title>they wore tight dresses of frog-colour, and masks with a mouth wide open; in the <title>Birds</title>, large beaks, bunches of feathers, combs, and so on, to imitate particular birds.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. Dramatic performances in Rome, as in Greece, formed a part of the usual public festivals, whether exceptional or ordinary, and were set on foot by the aediles and praetors. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossludi">Ludi</ref>.) A private individual, however, if he were giving a festival or celebrating a funeral, would have theatrical representations on his own account. The giver of the festival hired a troupe of players (<seg lang="la">grex</seg>), the director of which (<seg lang="la">dominus gregis</seg>) bought a play from a poet at his own risk. If the piece was a failure the manager received no compensation. But after its performance the piece became his property, to be used at future representations for his own profit. In the time of Cicero, when it was fashionable to revive the works of older masters, the selection of suitable pieces was generally left to the director. The Romans did not, like the Greeks, limit the number of actors to three, but varied it according to the requirements of the play. Women's parts were originally played by men, as in Greece. Women first appeared in mimes, and not till very late times in comedies. The actors were usually freedmen or slaves, whom their masters sent out to be educated, and then hired them out to the directors of the theatres. The profession was technically branded with <seg lang="la">infamia</seg>, nor was its legal position ever essentially altered. The social standing of actors was, however, improved through the influence of Greek education; and gifted artists like the comedian Roscius, and Aesopus, the tragedian, in Cicero's time, enjoyed the friendship of the best men in Rome. The instance of these two men may show what profits could be made by a good actor. Roscius received, for every day that he played, $175, and made an annual income of some $21,000. Aesopus, in spite of his great extravagance, left $852,500 at his death. Besides the regular <seg lang="la">honoraria</seg>, actors, if thought to deserve it, received other and voluntary presents from the giver of the performance. These often took the form of finely wrought crowns of silver or gold work. Masks were not worn until Roscius made their use general. Before his time actors had recourse to false hair of different colours and paint for the face. Young men wore black wigs; slaves, red ones; old men, white ones. The costume in general was modelled on that of actual life, Greek or Roman, but parasites were conventionally represented in black or gray (Pollux, iv. 148). As early as the later years of the Republic, a great increase took place in the splendour of the costumes and the general magnificence of the performance. In tragedy, particularly, a new effect was attained by massing the actors in great numbers on the stage.</p>

<head orig="Druĭdae">Druidae</head>

 <p> and <hi rend="bold">Druĭdes.</hi> The priests of religion among the ancient Gauls and Britons. Britain, according to Caesar (<title>B. G.</title> vi. 13 and 14), was the great school of the Druids, and their chief settlement was in the island called Mona by Tacitus, now Anglesey. To this island the natives of Gaul and Germany, who wished to be thoroughly versed in the mysteries of Druidism, resorted to complete their studies.</p>
 <p>Caesar's account of the Druids is as follows: “They attend to divine worship, perform public and private sacrifices, and expound matters of religion. A great number of youths are gathered round them for the sake of education, and they enjoy the highest honour in the nation; for nearly all public and private quarrels come under their jurisdiction; and when any crime has been committed, when a murder has been perpetrated, when a controversy arises about a legacy or about landmarks, they are the judges too. They fix rewards and punishments; and should any one, whether a private individual or a public man, disobey their decrees, then they exclude him from the sacrifices. This is with them the severest punishment. The persons who are thus laid under interdict are regarded as impious and wicked; everybody recoils from them, and shuns their society and conversation, lest he should be injured by associating with them. 
<pb n="559" /><cb /> They cannot obtain legal redress when they ask for it, nor are they admitted to any honourable office. All these Druids have one chief, who enjoys the supreme authority amongst them. When he dies, he is succeeded by that member of the order who is most prominent amongst the others, if there be any such single individual; if, however, there are several men equally distinguished, the successor is elected by the Druids. Sometimes they even go to war about this supremacy. At a certain time of the year, the Druids assemble on the territory of the Carnutes, which is believed to be the centre of all Gaul, in a sacred place. To that spot are gathered from everywhere all persons that have quarrels, and these abide by their judgments and decrees. It is believed that this institution was founded in Britain, and thence transplanted into Gaul. Even nowadays, those who wish to become more intimately acquainted with the institution generally go to Britain for instruction.</p>
 <p>“The Druids take no part in warfare; nor do they pay taxes like the rest of the people; they are exempt from military service, and from all public burdens. Attracted by such rewards, many come to be instructed of their own choice, while others are sent by their parents. They are reported to learn in the school a great number of verses, so that some remain there twenty years. They think it an unlawful thing to commit their lore to writing, though in the other public and private affairs of life they frequently make use of the Greek alphabet.</p>
 <p>“Beyond all things they are desirous to inspire a belief that men's souls do not perish, but transmigrate after death from one individual to another; and they hold that people are thereby most strongly incited to bravery, as the fear of death is thus destroyed. Besides, they hold a great many discourses about the stars and their motion, about the size of the world and of various countries, about the nature of things, about the power and might of the immortal gods; and they instruct the youths in these subjects.”</p>
 <p>Some further details are given by Pliny the Elder in his <title>Historia Naturalis</title> (xxix. 62, 1; xxiv. 12, 1; xxx. 4, 1). Besides their priestly character, the Druids appear to have practised magic, and to have been thoroughly versed in botany and in other sciences. The oak was especially sacred among them, and in oak-groves they performed their rites. The mistletoe was particularly reverenced, and Pliny tells us that it was removed from the tree by a Druid clothed in white, who cut it with a golden knife and gave it to a second Druid also in white, who, standing on the ground, received it. Pliny further speaks of a distinguishing badge, “the serpent's egg,” worn by the Druids, and formed by the poisonous spittle of a great number of serpents twined together and gathered by moonlight. It was worn in the bosom and was regarded as a powerful talisman. The account of Pliny refers to the Druids of Gaul, but there is no reason for supposing that there existed any essential difference between the Druidism of Gaul and that of Britain as described by Caesar. Mr. Whitley Stokes asserts that the Druids of Ireland were of less importance, forming not a priestly class, but simply a species of wizards and soothsayers.</p>
 <p>The Druids, by reason of their great influence <cb /> with the people, were a cause of continual trouble to the Roman conquerors, keeping alive the national aspirations and encouraging rebellion. Hence, the emperor Claudius formally refused the privilege of practising Druidical rites, and when Suetonius Paulinus defeated the Britons on the island of Mona (Anglesey) the sacred groves were destroyed. Yet on the Continent, Druidism continued to have followers down to the final overthrow of paganism.</p>
 <p>Scholars at the present day are extremely conservative in making any general statements regarding the Druids, and nearly all the elaborate theories that were formerly held are now regarded as unsafe. Even the view that the huge structures of stone found in Keltic countries were Druidical altars, or mark the seats of Druidical worship, is no longer accepted. The so-called Druidical temples at Avebury and Stonehenge in England, and at Carnac in France, were very possibly not Druidical at all, since similar structures have been found in Scandinavia and other parts of Europe where Druidism never existed. Regarding the etymology of the name <title>Druid</title> nothing certain can be alleged. Among the tentative and traditional explanations are the following: from the Keltic <hi rend="italic">deru</hi>, “an oak”; the Old German <hi rend="italic">druthin</hi>, “a master”; the Saxon <hi rend="italic">dry</hi>, “a magician”; the Irish <hi rend="italic">drui</hi>, “a sacred person, or priest”; and in the Keltic compare <hi rend="italic">derouyd</hi>, “a prophet” (De Chiniac). The old etymology from <foreign lang="greek">δρῦς</foreign> is absurd. The feminine form of the Latinized <title>Druida</title> is <title>Druias</title> (Lamprid. <title>Alex. Sev.</title> 60) or <title>Druis</title> (Vop. <title>Aurel.</title> 41). The Greek masculine form is <foreign lang="greek">Δρυΐδης</foreign> ( <bibl n="Aristoph.

 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosslivia">Livia</ref>, a daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina, born at Augusta Trevirorum (Trèves) A.D. 15. She was far from inheriting the excellent qualities of her mother. Her own brother Caligula seduced her, and then gave her in marriage, at the age of seventeen, to Lucius Cassius Longinus, a man of consular rank. Subsequently, however, he took her away from her husband and lived with her as his own wife. This connection lasted until the death of Drusilla, A.D. 38, and at her decease Caligula abandoned himself to the most extravagant sorrow. Divine honours were rendered to her memory, and medals were struck in her honour with the title of Augusta. She was twenty-three years of age at the time of her death ( <title>Calig.</title> 24). Dio Cassius calls the name of her husband Marcus Lepidus, differing in this from Suetonius. He may possibly refer to a second husband, who may have been given her, for

 form's sake, a short time before her death (Dio Cass. lix. 3).</p>
 <p>(3) A daughter of Agrippa, king of Iudaea, remarkable for her beauty. She was at first affianced to Epiphanes, son of Antiochus, king of Commagené. But, on his declining to submit to the rite of circumcision and become a Jew, the marriage was broken off. She was then given to Azizus, king of Emesa. Not long after, however, Drusilla renounced the religion of her fathers, abandoned her husband, and espoused Antonius Felix, a freedman of the emperor Claudius, and brother to Pallas, the freedman of Nero. This is the Felix who was governor of Iudaea and is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. Drusilla was with Felix at Caesarea when St. Paul appeared before the latter. She had a son by her second husband, named Agrippa, who perished in the eruption of Vesuvius which took place during the reign of Titus (Joseph. <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xix. 9).

<head orig="Drusus">Drusus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Claudius Nero</hi>, son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and of Livia, was born B.C. 38. He served early in the army, and was sent, in B.C. 17, with his brother Tiberius, against the Rhaeti and the Vindelici, who had made an irruption into Italy. He defeated the invaders, pursued them across the Alps, and reduced their country. Horace has celebrated this victory in one of his finest odes (iv. 4). Drusus married Antonia Minor, daughter of Antony and Octavia, by whom he had Germanicus and Claudius, afterwards emperor, and Livia or Livilla. In B.C. 14, being sent to quell an insurrection in Gaul, he succeeded by his conciliatory address. In the following year he attacked the Germans, and, carrying the war beyond the Rhine, he obtained a series of victories over the Sicambri, Cherusci, Catti, and Tencteri, and advanced <figure id="fig.00560">
<head orig="Statue of Drusus from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Statue of Drusus from Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> as far as the Visurgis (Weser), for which the Senate bestowed on him and his posterity the surname of Germanicus. In B.C. 9, Drusus was made consul. He was soon after sent by Augustus against the Germans, crossed the Visurgis, and advanced as far as the Albis (Elbe). He imposed a moderate tribute on the Frisians, which, being afterwards aggravated by his successors, caused a revolt in the reign of Tiberius ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 72" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 72</bibl>). He caused a canal to be cut, for the purpose of uniting the Rhine to the Yssel, which was known long after by the name of Fossa Drusi. Drusus did not cross the Albis, but retired towards the Rhine. Before he reached that river, <cb /> he died, at the age of thirty, in consequence, as it was reported, of his horse falling upon him and fracturing his leg (Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 142" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>142</bibl>). Tiberius, who was sent for in haste, and found his brother expiring, accompanied his body to Rome, where his funeral was performed with the greatest solemnity. Both Augustus and Tiberius delivered orations in his praise. Drusus was much regretted by both the army and the Romans in general, who had formed great expectations from his manly and generous character.</p>
 <p>(2) The son of the emperor Tiberius by Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa. He served with distinction in Pannonia and Illyricum, and was consul with his father, A.D. 21. In a quarrel with the imperial favourite Seianus, he gave the latter a blow in the face. Seianus, in revenge, seduced his wife Livia or Livilla, daughter of Drusus the elder and of Antonia; and the guilty pair destroyed Drusus by poison, which was administered by the eunuch Lygdus. The crime remained a secret for eight years, when it was discovered after the death of Seianus, and Livia was put to death ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>i. 24</bibl>, etc.; iv. 3 foll.).</p>
 <p>(3) Caesar, son of Germanicus and Agrippina, and brother of Nero Caesar and Caligula. He married Aemilia Lepida, who was induced by Seianus to betray her husband. Deluded himself by the arts of that evil minister, he conspired against the life of his brother, Nero Caesar, and was starved to death by order of Tiberius ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 60</bibl>).</p>

 </p>
 <p>(2) A class or decuria of iudices, first established by Augustus.

<head orig="Duēnos Inscription">Duenos Inscription</head>

 <p> The name commonly given to a very interesting inscription found at Rome near the Quirinal in 1880. It is inscribed upon three small earthen pots connected together, and is written from right to left. It reads as follows: <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iovei sat deivos qoi med mitat nei ted endo cosmis virco sied asted noisi ope toitesiai pacari vois. dvenos med feced en manom einom dzenoine med maao statod</hi>. This, rendered into classical forms, is probably to be read thus: <title>Iovi, Saturno divis qui (=si quis) me mittet, ne te endo (=in te) comis virgo sit ast nisi Opi Tutesiae pacari vis. Duenus me fecit in Manum: enim die noni me Mano stato</title>—i. e. “If any one brings me to the gods Iupiter and Saturn, let not any maiden be kind to thee, unless thou shalt offer a sacrifice to Ops Tutesia.

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>. A Roman consul, the first who obtained a victory over the naval power of Carthage, B.C. 260. After his colleague, Cn. Corn. Scipio, had been taken at sea by the Carthaginians in the First Punic War, Duilius proceeded, with a newly built Roman fleet, to Sicily, in quest of the enemy, whom he met near the Lipari Islands; and, by means of grappling-irons, so connected the ships of the Carthaginians with his own that the contest became a sort of land-fight. By this unexpected manoeuvre he took eighty and destroyed thirteen of the Carthaginian fleet and obtained a naval triumph, the first ever enjoyed at Rome. There were some medals struck in commemoration of this victory, and a column was erected on the occasion. This column (called Columna Rostrata, because adorned with beaks of ships) was, as Livy informs us, struck down by lightning during the interval between the second and third Punic wars.

<head orig="Duodĕcim Scripta">Duodecim Scripta</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">κύβοι, διαγραμμισμός</foreign>: in late Greek <foreign lang="greek">τάβλα</foreign>). A game of mixed chance and skill, which must have been substantially the same as our backgammon. The following points of identity may be regarded as established: The game was played on a board of twelve double lines with fifteen white and fifteen black men; the throws were counted as we count them; “blots” (<foreign lang="greek">ἄζυγες</foreign>) might be captured; the pieces (whether they started from home or not) had to be brought home; and the winner was he who first cleared off his men. On the other hand, there were three dice instead of two (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstessera">Tessera</ref>), and it is impossible to say where the men started or how blots taken up re-entered. In the initial position the pieces may have stood in three rows of five or five rows of three, and either in the player's own table with a view to the double journey or in the opponent's table with a view to the journey home. With the three dice the pieces would soon be scattered, and thus a less artificial arrangement than our own may be thought probable. The phrase <foreign lang="greek">ὀπισθιδίη ὁδὸς</foreign> in Agathias may seem to favour the notion that they were played out and home. The board was <foreign lang="greek">ἄβαξ</foreign> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossabacus">Abacus</ref>), more generally <seg lang="la">tabula</seg>, or from its raised rim <seg lang="la">alveus, alveolus;</seg> the men <foreign lang="greek">ψῆφοι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">calculi;</seg> the situation at any point of the game, <foreign lang="greek">θέσις</foreign>; to move, <foreign lang="greek">τιθέναι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">dare;</seg> to retract a move, <foreign lang="greek">ἀνατιθέναι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">reducere.</seg> In a fragment of Cicero (<hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. p. 170, s. v. <title>Scripta</title>) we find: <title>Itaque tibi concedo, quod in duodecim scriptis solemus, ut calculum reducas, si te alicuius dati poenitet.</title> This privilege is more likely to have been of the nature of odds granted by a superior player than a regular rule of the game.</p>
 <p>The classical Greek writers mostly use <foreign lang="greek">κύβοι, κυβεύειν</foreign>, of games into which skill entered as well as of mere dicing. That <foreign lang="greek">κυβεία</foreign> was a game of skill as well as chance is clear from Plato ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 10. 604" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>x. 604</bibl>C, <title>Phaedr.</title> 274 D) and from a story told by Plutarch (<title>Artax.</title> 17); cf. <title>Adelph.</title> iv. 7, 21. Ovid alludes to the Duodecim Scripta (<bibl n="Ov. Ars 3.363" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>A. A.</title> iii. 363-364</bibl>) among games which lovers are to play together; others are <seg lang="la">latrunculi</seg> (357-358, 361-362), and “go-bang” (365-366). Martial includes among his modest wants <seg lang="la">tabulamque calculosque</seg> (ii. 48). The celebrated jurisconsult P. Mucius Scaevola was famed for his skill at Duodecim Scripta ( <title>de Or.</title> i. 50. 217). Quintilian (xi. 2) further tells the story that Scaevola, after losing a game, accurately recalled all the throws and the way that each had been played; pointing out the move where he had made a mistake, and verifying his own recollections by those of his opponent. This is cited as an example of memory and logical sequence (<seg lang="la">ordo</seg>).</p>
 <p>None of the above passages shed much light on the details of the game. Our knowledge of them is mostly gained from an epigram of Agathias (<title>Anth. Pal.</title> ix. 482; also in Brunck, <bibl n="Ptol. Anal. 3. 60" default="NO"> <title>Anal.</title>iii. 60</bibl>) on a case of special ill-luck which befell the emperor Zeno (A.D. 474-491). This epigram has been <cb /> discussed by many scholars, but until lately was never rendered intelligible. The problem has been solved independently by M. Becq de Fouquières, in his <title>Jeux des Anciens</title>, and Dr. H. Jackson, in the English <title>Journal of Philology;</title> on the few points where they differed, Dr. Jackson has since given in his adherence to M. Becq de Fouquières's conclusions.</p>
 <p>More than a hundred ancient boards, serving for six different games, had been found in Rome alone <figure id="fig.00562">
<head orig="Board for Duodecim Scripta. (Rich.)">Board for Duodecim Scripta. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> down to 1877 (Marquardt, <title>Privatl.</title> 838); but only a single example shows the twelve lines. This is of marble, bears a Christian inscription, and is of very rude workmanship and illiterate spelling. It has been engraved by Gruter (<title>Mon. Chr.</title> p. 1091), Becq de Fouquières (p. 364), and in a simplified form, omitting the inscription, by Rich. This is to all intents and purposes a backgammon board, exhibiting the four half tables of six lines each. Mention is made of boards and men of costly materials or of peculiar construction. In Petronius (33) Trimalchio plays on a board of terebinthwood, with dice of crystal, and with gold and silver denarii for black and white men. Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 37.  13" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvii. 13</bibl>) has an absurdly rhetorical account of the splendours of an <seg lang="la">alveus lusorius</seg>, in gold and jewels, borne in Pompey's third triumph, B.C. 61; in the centre of it was a golden moon of thirty pounds' weight. The emperor Claudius had his carriage fitted with a board which could not upset, in order to play when travelling ( <title>Claud.</title> 33). The <seg lang="la">tabula lusoria</seg> described by Martial (xiv. 17) was also specially adapted for two different games, probably on opposite sides. The first line refers to the Duodecim Scripta; the second, modelled on a couplet of Ovid (<bibl n="Ov. Tr. 2.477" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Trist.</title> ii. 477-478</bibl>), to the game of draughts (<seg lang="la">latrunculi</seg>), in which the player left with but one man is bound to lose to his opponent who has two.

 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Duo viri Iuri Dicundo</hi>, the highest magistrates in the municipal towns.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Duo viri Sacrörum</hi>, to whom was at first intrusted the charge of the Sibylline Books (q. v.)

 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Duo viri aedi dedicandae</hi>, elected by the people for the purpose of dedicating a temple.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
