 <p> A numerous and powerful patrician house of ancient Rome, which became subdivided into several families or branches, distinguished by their respective cognomina, such as Fabii Maximi, Fabii Ambusti, Fabii Vibulani, etc. Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18.  3" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 3</bibl>) says that the name of this house arose from the circumstance of its founders having excelled in the culture of the bean (<seg lang="la">faba</seg>), the early Romans having been remarkable for their attachment to agricultural pursuits. The Fabii are said, by the ordinary authorities, to have been of Sabine origin, and to have settled on the Quirinal from the time of the earliest Roman kings. After the expulsion of the Tarquinii, the Fabian, as one of the older houses, exercised considerable influence in the Senate. Caeso Fabius, being quaestor with L. Valerius, impeached Spurius Cassius in B.C. 486, and had him executed. It has been noted as a remarkable fact, that, for seven consecutive years from that time, one of the two annual consulships was filled by three brothers Fabii in rotation. One of the three brothers, Q. Fabius Vibulanus, fell in battle against the Veientes in the year B.C. 479. In the following year, under the consulship of Caeso Fabius and Titus Virginius, the whole house of the Fabii proposed to leave Rome, and settle on the borders of the territory of Veii, in order to take the war against the Veientes entirely into their own hands. After performing solemn sacrifices, they left Rome in a body, mustering three hundred and six patricians, besides their families, clients, and freedmen, and encamped on the banks of the Cremera in sight of Veii. There they fortified themselves, and maintained for nearly two years a harassing warfare against the Veientes and other people of Etruria. At last, in one of their predatory incursions (B.C. 477), they fell into an ambuscade, and, fighting desperately, were all exterminated (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 48</bibl> foll.). Dionysius of Halicarnassus (ix. 19) gives also another account of this disaster, which he considers less credible. According to this latter form of the legend, the three hundred and six Fabii set off for Rome, in order to offer up a sacrifice in the chapel of their house. As they went to perform a pious ceremony, they proceeded without arms or warlike array. The Etrurians, however, knowing their road, placed troops in ambush, and, falling on the Fabii, cut them to pieces. It is said that one only of the Fabii escaped this massacre, having been left quite young at Rome (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 50</bibl>; Dion. Hal. ix. 22). His name was Q. Fabius Vibulanus, and he became the ancestor of all the subsequent Fabii. He was repeatedly consul, and was afterwards one of the Decemviri with Appius Claudius for two consecutive years, in which office he disgraced himself by his connivance at the oppressions of his colleague, which <cb /> caused the fall of the decemvirate. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdecemviri">Decemviri</ref>; Fabii.

<head orig="Fabius">Fabius</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">M. Ambustus</hi>, consul in B.C. 360, and again several times after. He fought against the Hernici and the Tarquinians, and left several sons.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Maximus Rulliānus</hi>, son of the preceding, attacked and defeated the Samnites, B.C. 324, in the absence and against the orders of his commanding officer, the Dictator Papirius, who would have brought him to punishment for disobedience, but was prevented by the intercession of the soldiers and the people. This Fabius was five times consul, and dictator twice. He triumphed over the Samnites, Marsi, Gauls, and Etrurians. His son, Q. Fabius Gurges, was thrice consul, and was grandfather of Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, one of the most celebrated generals of Rome.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Q. Maxĭmus Verrucōsus</hi>, the celebrated opponent of Hannibal. He is said to have been called Verrucosus from a wart on his lip, <seg lang="la">verruca</seg> being the Latin name for “a wart.” In his first consulship he triumphed over the Ligurians. After the victory of Hannibal at Lake Trasimenus (B.C. 217), he was named prodictator by the unanimous voice of the people, and was intrusted with the preservation of the Republic. The system which he adopted to check the advance of Hannibal is well known. By a succession of skilful movements, marches, and countermarches, always choosing good defensive positions, he harassed his antagonist, who could never draw him into places favourable for his attack, while Fabius watched every opportunity of availing himself of any error or neglect on the part of the Carthaginians. This mode of warfare, which was new to the Romans, acquired for Fabius the name of <ref type="cross" target="crosscunctator">Cunctātor</ref> or “delayer,” and was censured by the young, the rash, and the ignorant; but it was probably the means of saving Rome from ruin. Minucius, who shared with Fabius the command of the army, having imprudently engaged Hannibal, was saved from total destruction by the timely assistance of the dictator. In the following year, however, B.C. 216, Fabius being recalled to Rome, the command of the army was intrusted to the consul Terentius Varro, who rushed imprudently to battle, and the defeat at Cannae made manifest the wisdom of the dictator's previous caution. Fabius was chosen consul the next year, and was again employed in keeping Hannibal in check. In B.C. 210, being consul for the fifth time, he retook Tarentum by stratagem, after which he narrowly escaped being caught himself in a snare by Hannibal near Metapontum (<bibl n="Liv.  27. 15" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxvii. 15</bibl> foll.). When, some years after, the question was discussed in the Senate, of sending Scipio with an army into Africa, Fabius opposed it, saying that Italy ought first to be rid of Hannibal. Fabius died some time after at a very advanced age.
 </p>
 <p>(4) His son, called likewise <hi rend="SmallCaps">Quintus Fabius Maxĭmus</hi>, who had also been consul, died before him.</p>
 <p>(5) His grandson <hi rend="SmallCaps">Quintus Fabius Maxĭmus Serviliānus</hi>, being proconsul, fought against Viriathus in Spain, and concluded with him an honourable peace (Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 54" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>54</bibl>). He was afterwards consul repeatedly, and also censor. He wrote annals, which are quoted by Macrobius ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 1. 16" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>i. 16</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(6) His brother by adoption, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Quintus Fabius Maxĭmus Aemiliānus</hi>, the son of Aemilius Paulus (Livy , xlv. 41), was consul B.C. 144, and was the father of Fabius, called</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Allobrogĭcus</hi>, who subdued not 
<pb n="656" /><cb />
 only the Allobroges, but also the people of southern Gaul, which he reduced to a Roman province, called from that time Provincia. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Quintus Fabius Maxĭmus</hi>, a grandson of Fabius Maximus Servilianus, served in Spain under Iulius Caesar, and was made consul B.C. 44. Two of his sons or nephews were consuls in succession under Augustus. There was also a Fabius consul under Tiberius. Panvinius and others have reckoned that during a period of about five centuries, from the time of the first Fabius who is mentioned as consul to the reign of Tiberius, forty-eight consulships, seven dictatorships, eight censorships, seven augurships, besides the offices of master of the horse and military tribune with consular power, were filled by individuals of the Fabian house. It could also boast of thirteen triumphs and two ovations.</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crosspictor">Pictor</ref>, born about B.C. 254, the first Roman who wrote an historical account of his country in Greek. This historian, called by <seg lang="la">Livy scriptorum antiquissimus</seg>, appears to have been ill qualified for the labour he had undertaken, either in point of judgment, fidelity, or research; and to his carelessness, more than even to the loss of monuments, may be attributed much of the uncertainty which to this day hangs over the early ages of Roman history. Fabius lived in the time of the Second Punic War. His family received its cognomen from Gaius Fabius, who, having resided in Etruria and there acquired some knowledge of the fine arts, painted with figures the temple of Salus, in the year B.C. 303. The historian was grandson of the painter. He served in the Second Punic War, and was present at the battle of Trasimenus. After the defeat at Cannae he was sent by the Senate to inquire from the oracle at Delphi what would be the issue of the war, and to learn by what supplications the wrath of the gods might be appeased. His annals commenced with the age of Aeneas, and brought down the relation of Roman affairs to the author's own time—that is, to the end of the Second Punic War. We are informed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus that, for the great proportion of the events which preceded his own age, Fabius Pictor had no better authority than tradition. He probably thought that if he had confined himself to what was certain in those early times, his history would have become dry, insipid, and incomplete. This may have induced him to adopt the myths which the Greek historians had invented concerning the origin of Rome, and to insert whatever he found in family traditions, however contradictory or uncertain. Dionysius has also given many examples of Pictor's improbable narratives, his inconsistencies, his negligence in investigating the truth of what he relates as facts, and his inaccuracy in chronology. In particular, as we are told by Plutarch in his life of Romulus, Fabius followed an obscure Greek author, Diocles, in his account of the foundation of Rome, and from this source have flowed all the stories concerning Mars, the Vestal, the Wolf, Romulus and Remus, etc. Polybius, who flourished shortly after those times, and was at pains to inform himself accurately concerning all the events of the Second Punic War, apologizes on one occasion for quoting Fabius as an authority. Livy quotes him eight times. The fragments are given by H. Peter in his <title>Hist. Relliquiae</title>, i. 5, 109. See also Schwegler, <title>Römische Geschichte</title>, i. 412; Mommsen, <title>Römische Forschungen</title>, ii. 279; H.

 <p>A distinguished Italian archaeologist, born at Urbino in Umbria in 1618. He studied law at Cagli and in his native city, where he took the doctor's degree at the age of eighteen. He soon after attracted the notice of Cardinal Lorenzo Imperiali, by whose influence he was employed in important political negotiations in Spain, where he acted as treasurer and later as auditor to the Papal legation at Madrid, remaining there for thirteen years. Returning to Rome, he became a judge, and then an auditor of legation at Urbino. Having always had a strong predilection for antiquarian studies, he now, by the invitation of Cardinal Carpegna, found an opportunity of prosecuting them at his leisure. Taking up his residence in Rome, he began the archaeological investigations that have made his name memorable, by a most minute study of the topography and ruins of the Campagna, spending day after day in solitary expeditions on his horse Marco Polo, of which he has written pleasantly as being an animal with a keen scent for buried monuments.</p>
 <p>In 1680, Fabretti published his first important work, entitled <title>De Aquis et Aquae Ductibus Veteris Romae</title>—a treatise which cleared up many obscure points in the topography of Latium, and which is printed in the <title>Thesaurus</title> of Graevius <bibl default="NO">(iv. 1677)</bibl>. Other treatises of his are that <bibl default="NO"><title>De Columna Traiani Syntagma</title> (Rome, 1683)</bibl>; and the <bibl default="NO"><title>Inscriptionum Antiquarum Explicatio</title> (Rome, 1699)</bibl>. The former contains an explanation also of the famous Iliac Table, a bas-relief now in the Capitol, and representing scenes in the Trojan War. Both these works throw much light on Roman archaeology, and are especially important for their recognition of the comparative method of studying epigraphic remains. Fabretti became involved in a controversy with <ref type="cross" target="crossgronovius">Gronovius</ref> (q.v.) regarding the interpretation by the former of a passage in Livy , and the two scholars assailed each other in the abusive vocabulary of contemporary scholarship, Fabretti styling Gronovius <title>Grunnovius</title> or “grunter,” and Gronovius retorting by calling Fabretti <seg lang="la">faber rusticus.</seg></p>
 <p>Fabretti died in January, 1700, having been for a number of years keeper of the archives of the Castello S. Angelo, under Innocent XII.—an office of great responsibility.

 <p> (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, surnamed <ref type="cross" target="crossluscinus">Luscīnus</ref>. A Roman, consul for the first time in the year B.C. 283, when he triumphed over the Boii and Etrurians. After the defeat of the Romans, under the consul Laevinus, by Pyrrhus (B.C. 281), Fabricius was sent by the Senate as legate to the king, to treat for the ransom of the prisoners, or, according to others, to propose terms of peace. Pyrrhus is said to have endeavoured to bribe him by large offers, which Fabricius, poor as he was, rejected with scorn, to the great admiration of the king. Fabricius being again consul, B.C. 279, was sent against Pyrrhus, who was then encamped near Tarentum. The physician of the king is said to have come secretly to the Roman camp, and to have promised Fabricius to poison his master for a bribe. The consul, indignant at this, had him put in fetters and sent back to Pyrrhus, on whom this instance of Roman integrity made a strong impression. Pyrrhus soon after sailed for Sicily, whither he was called by the Syracusans, then hard pressed by the Carthaginians. Fabricius, having defeated the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttii, who had joined Pyrrhus against Rome, triumphed over these nations. Pyrrhus, afterwards returning to Italy, was finally defeated and driven away by M'. Curius Dentatus, B.C. 276. Two years after, Fabricius being consul for the third time, with Claudius Cinna for his colleague, ambassadors came from King Ptolemy of Egypt to contract an alliance with Rome. Several instances are related of the extreme frugality and simplicity which marked the manners of Fabricius. When censor, he dismissed from the Senate P. Cornelius Rufinus, who had been twice consul, and had also held the dictatorship, because he had in his possession ten pounds' weight of silver plate. Fabricius died poor, and the Senate was obliged to make provision for his daughters ( Plut. <title>Pyrrh.</title>), and in order to show the greatest possible respect for his memory he was interred within the Pomoerium, though the law forbade such burials.</p>

He studied at Leipzig and Quedlinburg, taking the degrees in philosophy, and afterwards pursuing medicine and theology. At Quedlinburg, two books that he found in the library of Samuel Schmidt (Barthuiss's <title>Adversaria</title> and Morhoff's <title>Polyhistor</title>) gave him the suggestions that led to the preparation of his two great works, the <title>Bibliotheca Latina</title> and the still more important <title>Bibliotheca Graeca.</title> The first appeared at Hamburg in 1697, and was revised and emended by Ernesti in three volumes <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1773)</bibl>. Its secondary title explains its scope: <title>Notitia Auctorum Veterum Latinorum Quorumcumque Scripta ad Nos Venerunt.</title> The divisions adopted in this compilation are, (1) The writers preceding the age of Tiberius;</p>
 <p>(2) The writers from Tiberius to the Antonines;</p>
 <p>(3) The writers from the Antonines to the decay of the language;</p>
 <p>(4) The fragments from old authors, with chapters on the early Christian literature. The <title>Bibliotheca Graeca</title> is further styled <title>Notitia Scriptorum Veterum Graecorum Quorumcumque Monumenta Integra aut Fragmenta Edita Extant, tum Plerorumque e Manuscript. ac Deperditis.</title> This work, which has been styled <seg lang="la">maximus antiquae eruditionis thesaurus</seg>, is in fourteen quarto <cb /> volumes, appearing at Hamburg at intervals from 1705 to 1728, and subsequently revised by Harles <bibl default="NO">(Hamburg, 1790)</bibl>. Its divisions are marked off by Homer, Plato, Christ, Constantine, and by the capture of Constantinople in 1453, with a sixth section devoted to canon law, medicine, and jurisprudence. Besides these two great compilations, Fabricius, who was a most voluminous writer, put forth 126 other works, some of them, however, being books that he edited only, and none of them of any especial interest to the classical student.</p>
 <p>Fabricius held at different times the posts of librarian and Professor of Rhetoric and Ethics <bibl default="NO">(1699)</bibl>, and Rector of the School of St. John at Hamburg. He declined chairs at Greifswald <bibl default="NO">(1701)</bibl> and Wittenberg. He died at Hamburg, April 30, 1736.

 <p>A famous Italian lexicographer and stylist, born at Toriggia in 1682. He studied at Padua, and in the university of that city was made Professor of Logic and Regent of the Schools, continuing this connection for fortyfive years. After putting forth several new editions of existing books, such as the <title>Thesaurus Ciceronianus</title> of Nizolius, and the polyglot vocabulary in seven languages of Calepino, he began his magnificent work, the <title>Totius Latinitatis Lexicon</title>, the first volume of which appeared at Padua in 1771. Of this splendid production it has been said that the whole body of Latinity, if lost, might be restored from this great lexicon. It is, in fact, the source of all the Latin lexicons now in use, and is an imperishable monument to the learning, industry, and judgment of its chief author. In its preparation, Facciolati was ably assisted by his pupil, Egidio <ref type="cross" target="crossforcellini">Forcellini</ref> (q.v.), who had also aided in the Calepine vocabulary, and to whom is said to be due the suggestion of the new lexicon itself. The fourth and last volume appeared in 1771, after the death of both the editors. Subsequent editions are the English one in two vols. <bibl default="NO">(London, 1826)</bibl>, and that of De Vit <bibl default="NO">(1858-87)</bibl>. Facciolati was a writer of extremely elegant Latin, and a number of his letters have been published. His reputation in his own lifetime was very great, so that he received most flattering offers from the other universities of Europe, all of which he declined. He died at Padua in 1769. His life has been written by Ferrari <bibl default="NO">(1799)</bibl> and Gennari <bibl default="NO">(1818)</bibl>. See the article <ref type="cross" target="crosslexicon">Lexicon</ref>.

 <p> The crime of falsum is not defined by Roman legal writers, but it consisted of acts of fraud which were injurious to <seg lang="la">fides publica</seg>, such as forgery, counterfeiting money, and perverting the course of justice by fraud and perjury. The oldest legislative provisions at Rome against any acts of this description are those of the Twelve Tables, to the effect that a person who gave false testimony should be thrown from the Tarpeian 
<pb n="659" /><cb /> Rock ( <bibl n="Gel.  21. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xxi. 53</bibl>), and that a judge who took a bribe should be liable to capital punishment ( <bibl n="Gel.  21. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.xxi. 7</bibl>); but there were trials for false testimony before the enactment of the Twelve Tables (<bibl n="Liv.  3. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, iii. 24</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  25" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 25</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  29" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 29</bibl>; iv. 21). The next legislation in falsum, so far as is known, was contained in one of the Leges Corneliae passed in the time of the dictator Sulla , which was divided, according to Cicero, into two heads, the Lex Testamentaria and the Lex Numaria (<title>Verr.</title> ii. 1, 42), with reference to the two species of the crime the statute was directed against. Paulus, who gives its provisions, entitles it Lex Cornelia Testamentaria; it is also known by the more general title Lex Cornelia de Falsis.</p>
 <p>The Lex Cornelia appears to have included only two specific kinds of falsum: (1) forgery and suppression of wills, and</p>
 <p>(2) adulteration of the coinage.</p>
 <p>An offence against either branch of this law was a <seg lang="la">crimen publicum</seg>, and was under the cognizance of a standing <seg lang="la">quaestio.</seg> The punishment of falsum under the law (at least when Paulus wrote) was <seg lang="la">deportatio in insulam</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdeportatio">Deportatio</ref>) for the “honestiores,” and the mines, crucifixion, or other degrading punishment for the “humiliores.” In place of <seg lang="la">deportatio in insulam</seg> the punishment, according to the statute itself, was probably the old form of banishment, known as <seg lang="la">ignis et aquae interdictio</seg> (q. v.). The property of a convicted person was confiscated.</p>
 <p>The penalty of the Lex Cornelia was extended by piecemeal legislation to cases not comprised in the lex, but all of a similar kind. This supplementary law is sometimes referred in legal treatises to the Lex Cornelia, as if it had been an original part of that law. The instrument fabricated or falsified might be either public or private, as e. g. a rescript or edict of the emperor, an account book, or an instrument of sale.</p>
 <p>Persons guilty of falsifying documents are called <seg lang="la">falsarii.</seg> As a precaution against such persons, it was enacted in the time of Nero that <seg lang="la">tabulae</seg> or written contracts should be pierced with holes and a triple thread passed through the holes, in addition to the signature ( Suet. <title>Ner.</title>c. 17; <bibl n="Paul.  5. 25" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul.v. 25</bibl><bibl n="Paul.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul., 6</bibl>). In the time of Nero it was also provided that the first two parts (<seg lang="la">cerae</seg>) of a will should have only the testator's signature, and the remaining one those of the witnesses. Likewise, in order to prevent fraud, it was enacted under the emperor Claudius that a person who was employed by a testator to write a will should be liable to the penalty of the Lex Cornelia if he inscribed a legacy to himself, although he did so at the dictation of the testator (Cod. ix. 23, 3; Suetonius, <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 17" default="NO"> <title>Ner.</title>17</bibl>, attributes this law to Nero). The Lex de Falsis was further extended to fraudulent assumptions of names and rank, and to false pretences, as in the case of a contract to sell a thing to a person, when the vendor had already contracted to sell the same thing to some one else. The <seg lang="la">crimen falsi</seg> was also made to include perjury, the corruption of judges, and other kindred offences. By a senatusconsultum in the fourteenth year of Tiberius, the penalties of the law were extended to those who for money undertook to maintain causes, or to procure testimony; and by a senatusconsultum passed somewhat earlier, conspiracies for the ruin of innocent persons were comprised within the limits of the law. <cb /></p>
 <p>According to Paulus (v. 25, 1), the refusal to accept in payment genuine coin stamped with the head of the princeps was on the same footing as the adulteration of the coinage, though in this case the element of fraud seems wanting. The use of false measures and weights was punished as falsum. It appears from numerous passages in the Roman writers that the crime of falsum in its different forms was very common, and especially in the case of wills. See Rein, <title>Das Criminalrecht der Römer</title>, p. 774, etc.

 <p> dim. <hi rend="bold">Falcŭla</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἅρπη, δρέπανον</foreign>, dim. <foreign lang="greek">δρεπάνιον</foreign>). A sickle; a scythe; a pruning-knife or pruning-hook; a bill; a falchion; a halbert.</p>
 <p>As <seg lang="la">culter</seg> denoted a knife with one straight edge, “falx” signified any similar instrument, the single edge of which was curved (<foreign lang="greek">δρέπανον εὐκαμπές; γαμψὰς δρεπάνας</foreign>; <seg lang="la">curvae falces; curvamine falcis ahenae; adunca falce</seg>). By additional epithets the various uses of the falx were indicated, and its corresponding varieties in form and size. Thus the sickle, because it was used by reapers, was called <seg lang="la">falx messoria;</seg> the scythe, which was employed in mowing hay, was called <seg lang="la">falx foenaria;</seg> the pruning-knife and the bill, on account of their use in dressing vines, as well as in hedging and in cutting off the shoots and branches of trees, were distinguished by the appellation of <seg lang="la">falx putatoria, vinitoria, arboraria</seg>, or <seg lang="la">silvatica</seg>, or by the diminutive <seg lang="la">falcula.</seg> <figure id="fig.00659">
<head orig="Falx.">Falx.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The illustration is taken from a MS. of Columella, and explains his description of the various parts of the <seg lang="la">falx vinitoria.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossculter">Culter</ref>.) After the removal of a branch by the pruning-hook, it was often smoothed, as in modern gardening, by the chisel. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdolabra">Dolabra</ref>.) The edge of the falx was often toothed or serrated (<foreign lang="greek">ἅρπην καρχαρόδοντα</foreign>; <seg lang="la">denticulata</seg>). The indispensable process of sharpening these instruments (<foreign lang="greek">ἅρπην χαρασσέμεναι, ἅρπην εὐκαμπῆ νεοθηγέα</foreign>) was effected by whetstones, which the Romans obtained from Crete and other distant places, with the addition of oil or water, which the mower (<hi rend="italic">foenisex</hi>) carried in a horn upon his thigh.</p>
 <p>Numerous as were the uses to which the falx was applied in agriculture and horticulture, its employment in battle was almost equally varied, though not so frequent. The Geloni were noted for its use. It was the weapon with which Zeus wounded Typhon; with which Heracles slew the Lernaean Hydra; and with which Hermes cut off the head of Argus (<title>falcato ense; harpen Cyllenida</title>). Perseus, having received the same weapon from Hermes, or, according to other authorities, from Hephaestus, used it to decapitate Medusa and to slay the sea-monster. Hence, it may be concluded that the falchion was a weapon of the most remote antiquity; that it was girt like a dagger upon the waist; that it was held in the hand by a short hilt; and that, as it was, in fact, a dagger or sharp-pointed 
<pb n="660" /><cb />
 blade, with a proper falx projecting from one side, it was thrust into the flesh up to this lateral curvature.</p>
 <p>The weapon which has just been described, when attached to the end of a pole, would assume the form and be applicable to all the purposes of the mediaeval halberd. Such must have been the <seg lang="la">asseres falcati</seg> used by the Romans at the siege of Ambracia. Sometimes the iron head was so large as to be fastened, instead of the ram's head, to a wooden beam, and worked by men under a <seg lang="la">testudo</seg> (q. v.).</p>
 <p>Lastly, the Assyrians, the Persians, the Medes, and the Syrians in Asia, and the Gauls and Britons in Europe (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscovinus">Covinus</ref>), made themselves formidable on the field of battle by the use of chariots with scythes fixed at right angles (<foreign lang="greek">εἰς πλάγιον</foreign>) to the axle and turned downward, or inserted parallel to the axle into the felly of the wheel, so as to revolve, when the chariot was put in motion, with more than thrice the velocity of the chariot itself; and sometimes also projecting from the extremities of the axle.

 <p> The Latin name for a household community, consisting of the master of the house (<seg lang="la">pater familias</seg>), his wife (<seg lang="la">mater familias</seg>), his sons and unmarried daughters (<seg lang="la">filii</seg> and <seg lang="la">filiae familias</seg>), the wives, sons, and unmarried daughters of the sons, and the slaves. All the other members of the family were subject to the authority of the <seg lang="la">pater familias.</seg> (For the power of the husband over his wife, see <ref type="cross" target="crossmanus">Manus</ref>.) In virtue of his paternal authority (<seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg>), the <seg lang="la">pater familias</seg> had absolute authority over his children. He might, if he liked, expose them, sell them, or kill them. These rights, as manners were gradually softened, were more and more rarely enforced; but they legally came to an end only when the father died, lost his citizenship, or of his own will freed his son from his authority. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossemancipatio">Emancipatio</ref>.) They could, however, be transferred to another person if the son were adopted, or the daughter married. A son, if of full age, was not in any way interfered with by the <seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg> in the exercise of his civil rights. But in the exercise of his legal rights as an individual, he was dependent always on his father. He could, for instance, own no property; but all that he acquired was, in the eye of the law, at the exclusive disposal of his father. The <seg lang="la">pater familias</seg> alone had the right of making dispositions of the family property by mortgage, sale, or will.

 <p> A remarkable monolithic group of statuary by the Rhodian sculptors Apollonius and Tauriscus, representing the sons of Antiopé binding Dircé to a wild bull. (For the story see <ref type="cross" target="crossantiope">Antiopé</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdirce">Dircé</ref>.) This group was found at Rome in the Thermae of Caracalla in a badly mutilated condition, and was restored under the supervision of Michael Angelo and, later, by the Milanese sculptor Bianchi. The boldness and life of the group originally carved from a single block of marble are unrivalled by any similar work. It is represented in the illustration on page 86. The parts restored are the head of the bull, the whole of Antiopé (except the feet), the upper parts of Dircé, and all of Zetheus and Amphion except one torso and one leg.

The statue, which is now in the Museo Nazionale at Naples, was found at Rome in the Thermae of Caracalla in 1540. It then lacked the legs and the left hand, which were

 restored by Della Porta after a model in terra cotta by Michael Angelo. Twenty years later the original legs were found in a well three miles from the place whence the statue itself was taken. The work is evidently of a comparatively late period, and shows a tendency to exaggeration in the overstrained effort to express muscular strength, which led Thackeray to characterize it as a “clumsy, caricatured porter.” It is reproduced in the illustration on page 793.

<head orig="Fasces">Fasces</head>

 <p> The Latin name for a bundle of rods, tied together by a red strap, and enclosing an axe, with its head outside. The fasces were originally the emblem of the king's absolute authority over life and limb, and as such passed over to the high magistrates of the Republic. In the city, however, the latter had to remove the axe and to lower the rods in the presence of the popular assembly as the sovereign power. The lowering of the fasces was also the form in which the lower officials saluted the higher. The king was preceded by lictors bearing twelve fasces, and so were the consuls and proconsuls. The proconsuls, however, were, since the time of Augustus, only allowed this number if they had actually been consuls previously. The dictator had twenty-four fasces, as representing the two consuls, and his <seg lang="la">magister equitum</seg> had six. Six was also the number allotted to the proconsuls and propraetors outside the city, and in the imperial age to those proconsuls who had provinces in virtue of their having held the prae<figure id="fig.00661">

</figure> torship. The praetors of the city had two, the imperial legates administering particular provinces had five fasces. One was allotted to the <title>flamen Dialis</title> and (from or after B.C. 42) to the Vestal Virgins. Fasces crowned with bay were, in the republican age, the <seg lang="la">insignia</seg> of an officer who was saluted as Imperator. During the imperial age, this title was conferred on the emperor at his accession, and soon confined exclusively to him. The emperor was accordingly preceded by twelve <seg lang="la">fasces laureati.</seg> The lictors held their fasces over the left shoulder; but at funerals, the fasces of a deceased magistrate, and his arms, were carried reversed behind the bier.</p>
 <p>The fasces appear to have been in later times <figure id="fig.00661.2">

Amulets of various kinds were employed as counter-charms. They were supposed either to procure the protection of a particular deity, or to send the enchanter mad by means of terrible, ridiculous, or obscene objects. The name

 <p> sc. <seg lang="la">dies.</seg> Properly speaking, the Roman court-days, on which the praetor was allowed to give his judgments in the solemn formula <title>Do Dico Addico</title>, and generally to act in his judicial capacity. The name was further applied to the days on which it was lawful (<seg lang="la">fas</seg>) to summon the assembly and the Senate (<seg lang="la">dies comitiales</seg>); for these days might be used as court-days in case the assembly did not meet; while on <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg> proper no meeting of the <seg lang="la">comitia</seg> could take place. The opposite of <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg> were the <seg lang="la">dies nefasti</seg>, or days on which on account of purifications, holidays, <seg lang="la">feriae</seg>, and on other religious grounds, the courts could not sit, nor the Comitia assemble. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossferiae">Feriae</ref>.) The <seg lang="la">dies religiosi</seg> were also counted as <seg lang="la">nefasti.</seg> Besides the 38-45 <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg> proper, the 188-194 <seg lang="la">dies comitiales</seg>, the 48-50 <seg lang="la">dies nefasti</seg>, and 53-59 <seg lang="la">dies religiosi</seg>, there were 8 <seg lang="la">dies intercisi</seg>, which were <seg lang="la">nefasti</seg> in the morning and evening because of certain sacrifices which took place then, but fasti for the remaining hours. There were also 3 <seg lang="la">dies fissi</seg> (split days), which were <seg lang="la">nefasti</seg> until the conclusion of a particular proceeding—e. g. the removal of the sweepings from the Temple of Vesta on June 15th, but <seg lang="la">fasti</seg> afterwards.</p>
 <p>The division of days into <seg lang="la">fasti</seg> and <seg lang="la">profesti</seg>, or holidays and workdays, only affected private life, though many <seg lang="la">dies nefasti</seg>, as <seg lang="la">feriae</seg>, would be identical with <seg lang="la">dies fasti.</seg></p>
 <p>The list of the <seg lang="la">dies fasti</seg> was of immense importance as affecting legal proceedings, and indeed all public life. For a long time it was in the hands of the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi>, and was thus only accessible to the patricians; but at last (B.C. 304) Gnaeus Flavius published it and made it generally accessible. This list, called simply <title>Fasti</title>, was the origin of the Roman calendar, which bore the same name. In this calendar the days of the year are divided into weeks of eight days each, indicated by the letters A to H. Each day has marks indicating its number in the month, its legal significance (F=<seg lang="la">fastus</seg>, N=<seg lang="la">nefastus</seg>, C=<seg lang="la">comitialis</seg>, EN = <seg lang="la">intercisus</seg>). The festivals, sacrifices, and games occurring on it are also added, as well as notices of historical occurrences, the rising and setting of the stars, and other matters. No trace remains of any calendar previous to Caesar; but several calendars composed after Caesar's reform have been preserved. Ovid's <title>Fasti</title> is a poetical explanation of the Roman festivals of the first six months. We have also many fragments of calendars, painted or <cb /> engraved on stone, belonging to Rome and other Italian cities; for it was common to put up calendars of this kind in public places, temples, and private houses. There are two complete calendars in existence—one an official list written by Furius Dionysius Philocalus in A.D. 354, the other a Christian version of the official calendar, made by Polemius Silvius in A.D. 448. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscalendarium">Calendarium</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdies">Dies</ref>.</p>
 <p>The word fasti was further applied to the annual lists of the triumphs, high officials, consuls, dictators, censors, and priests. These lists were originally, like the other fasti, made out by the <hi rend="italic">pontifices.</hi> Some fragments of them have survived, among which may be mentioned the Fasti Capitolini, so called from the Roman Capitol, where they are now preserved. They were originally, in B.C. 36-30, engraved on the marble wall of the Regia, or official residence of the Pontifex Maximus, and afterwards continued first to B.C. 12, and afterwards to A.D. 13.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Fatua.</hi> A goddess of the Latins. According to the old Roman legends, by which all the Italian deities were originally mortals, she 
<pb n="663" /><cb />
 was the daughter of Picus, and the sister and wife of Faunus. One account makes her to have never left her bower, or let herself be seen of men; and to have been deified for this reason, becoming identical with the Bona Dea, and no man being allowed to enter her temple (Macrob. i. 12). According to another tradition, she was not only remarkable for her modesty, but also for her extensive and varied knowledge. Having, however, on one occasion, made free with the contents of a jar of wine, she was beaten to death by her husband with myrtle-twigs. Repenting, however, soon after of the deed, he bestowed on her divine honours. Hence, in the celebration of her sacred rites, myrtle-boughs were carefully excluded; nor was any wine allowed to be brought, under that name, into her temple; but it was called “honey,” and the vessel containing it also was termed <seg lang="la">mellarium</seg>, “honey-jar” (cf. Macrob. i. 12). Fauna is said to have given oracles from her temple after death, which circumstance, according to some, affords an etymology for the name Fatua or Fatuella, which was often borne by her (from <seg lang="la">fari</seg>, “to declare”). There can be little doubt that Fauna is identical not only with the Bona Dea, but with Terra, Tellus, and Ops—in other words, with the Earth personified (Macrob. l. c.).

(On the etymology of the word see Nettleship, <title>Lectures and Essays</title>, pp. 50-54). One of the oldest and most popular Roman deities, who was identified with the Greek Pan on account of the similarity of their attributes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspan">Pan</ref>.) As a good spirit of the forest, plains, and fields, he gave fruitfulness to the cattle, and was hence called Inuus. With all this he was also a god of prophecy, called by the name of Fatuus, with oracles in the sacred groves of Tibur, around the well Albunea, and on the Aventine. The responses were said to have been given in Saturnian verse. (Cf. Varro, <title>L. L.</title> vii. 36.) Faunus revealed the future in dreams and strange voices, communicated to his votaries while sleeping in his precincts upon the fleeces of sacrificed lambs. A goddess of like attributes, called Fauna and Fatua, was associated in his worship. She was regarded sometimes as his wife, sometimes as his sister.

Just as Pan was accompanied by the <foreign lang="greek">Πανίσκοι</foreign>, or little Pans, so the existence of many Fauni was assumed besides the chief Faunus. They were imagined as merry, capricious beings, and in particular as mischievous goblins who caused nightmares. In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, son of Picus, and grandson of Saturnus, father of Latinus by the nymph Marica. After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding. Two festivals, called Faunalia, were celebrated in his honour—one on the 13th of February, in the temple <cb /> on the island in the Tiber, the other on the 5th of December, when the peasants brought him rustic offerings and amused themselves with dancing.

He is said to have been born an hermaphrodite or a eunuch, yet was once charged with adultery by a Roman of rank; so that he afterwards used to boast of three things—that being a eunuch, he had been accused of adultery; that though a Gaul, he both wrote and spoke Greek; and that though he had given offence to the emperor, he still lived. He wrote numerous works, but no part of them has reached us except a few fragments in Stobaeus. Aulus Gellius, however, has preserved for us some of his dissertations in a Latin dress (<title>Noct. Att.</title> xii. 1; xiv. 1, 2; xvii. 10). Gellius, in fact, regarded him with great admiration, and in his <title>Noctes Atticae</title> plays Boswell in a mild way to Favorinus's Johnson. Favorinus loved to write on topics out of the common path, and more or less whimsical; he composed, for example, a eulogy on Thersites, another on quartan fever, etc. Having had the misfortune to offend the emperor Hadrian, his statues, which the Athenians had raised to him, were thrown down by that same people. He bequeathed his library and mansion at Rome to Herodes Atticus. Favorinus was a friend of Plutarch, who dedicated a work to him.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τόκος</foreign>). Interest on money. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. In Greece the rate of interest on invested capital was not restricted by law, but was left entirely to arrangement between the parties concerned ( <title>c. Theomn.</title> i. 18). The average rate, compared with that usually given at the present day, was very high, far higher than the rent either of houses or land. This is partly explained by the proportionately greater scarcity of ready money, and by the fact that it was difficult to accumulate a large amount of capital.</p>
 <p>In the time of Demosthenes, 12 per cent. was regarded as a rather low rate of interest, and higher rates, up to 18 per cent., were quite common. In bottomry (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ ναυτικὸν δάνεισμα</foreign>) the ordinary rate of interest at Athens was 20 per cent. In the event of failure in the payment of interest due, compound interest was charged. In the computation of interest two different methods were employed. It was usual to specify either the sum to be paid by the month on every mina (equal in intrinsic value of silver to about $16.50), or the fraction of the principal which was annually paid as interest. Capital therefore was said to be invested at a drachma, if for every mina (100 drachmae) there was paid interest at the rate of one drachma —i. e. 1 per cent. monthly, and consequently 12 per cent. per annum. Or again, if 12 1/2 per cent. <cb /> yearly interest was to be paid, the capital was said to be invested at “one eighth.” In most cases the interest appears to have been paid monthly, and on the last day of the month; but payment by the year was not unknown. In bottomry the interest was according to the terms of the contract.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. At Rome, as at Athens, the rate of interest was originally unrestricted, and it was not until after hard struggles that, by the laws of the Twelve Tables, a regular yearly rate of interest at one twelfth of the capital, or 8 1/3 per cent., was established. But this and subsequent legal limitations were all the less effectual for putting down usury, because they were valid in the case of Roman citizens only, and not in that of foreigners. Usury was accordingly practised under the name of foreigners up to the end of the second century B.C., when the laws against it were extended so as to include aliens. Through intercourse with Asia and Greece, a change in the payment of interest was gradually introduced, which in the first half of the first century B.C. was generally adopted. Capital was no longer lent by the year, but by the month, and monthly interest was paid on the first day of each month; notice of intention to call in the loan was given on the Ides (the 13th or 15th day of the month), and reimbursement took place on the first day (Kalends) of the following month. The regular rate of interest with this reckoning was 1 per cent. monthly, or 12 per cent. per annum. The accumulation of large fortunes in Rome at the end of the Republic considerably lessened the rate of interest on safe investments. The chief field for usury was then the provinces, whose inhabitants were compelled by the exorbitant imposts to be continually raising loans at any price. The custom, long permitted, of adding the year's unpaid interest to the principal was first forbidden by the later Roman law. Justinian permanently fixed the rate of interest in ordinary investments at 6 per cent., in commercial enterprises at 8 per cent., and in bottomry, in which it had previously been unlimited on account of the risk incurred by the stock on long voyages, at 12 per cent.

 <p> Holidays at Rome, dedicated to the worship of some deity. A distinction was drawn between <seg lang="la">feriae privatae</seg>, or holidays observed by <seg lang="la">gentes</seg>, families, and individuals, and <seg lang="la">feriae publicae</seg>, or public holidays. Public holidays were either fixed or movable, or occasional. The fixed holidays (<seg lang="la">feriae stativae</seg>) were forty-five in number, and were celebrated every year on a definite day and registered accordingly in the calendar. The movable holidays (<seg lang="la">feriae conceptivae</seg>) were also annual, but were held on changing days, and had therefore to be announced beforehand by the consuls, or in their absence by the praetor. The occasional holidays (<seg lang="la">imperativae</seg>) were commanded on special occasions by the authorities with the consent of the pontifices. Such were, for instance, the <seg lang="la">supplicationes</seg>, a solemn service to the gods to celebrate a victory or the like. One of the principal movable festivals was the <ref type="cross" target="crossferiae-latinae">Feriae Latīnae</ref>. This was originally a celebration by the Latin race held on the Alban Mount in honour of Iupiter Latiaris. It was subsequently transformed by Tarquinius Superbus into a festival of the Latin League. Its most notable ceremony consisted in the sacrifice of white bulls, a portion of whose flesh was distributed to each of the cities of the League represented at the sacrifice. If any city did not receive its portion, or if any other point in the ceremonial was omitted, the whole sacrifice had to be repeated. Originally it lasted one day, but afterwards was extended to four. It was then celebrated in part on the Alban Mount by the Roman consuls, in presence of all the magistrates; and in part on the Roman Capitol, a race being included in the performance.

 <p> An old Italian goddess, of Sabine origin, but also much worshipped in Etruria. She seems originally to have been regarded in the same light as Flora, Libera, and Venus. The Greeks called her a goddess of flowers; on coins she is represented as a girl in the bloom of youth, with flowers in her hair. She was also worshipped as the goddess of emancipation from slavery. She had a very celebrated shrine at the foot of Mount Soracté in Etruria, where the whole neighbourhood used to bring her rich votive offerings and the firstfruits of the field. The annual festivals served as fairs, such was the crowd of people who flocked to them. The mythical king Herulus or Erulus of Praenesté was regarded as her son. He had three lives, and had to be slain three times by Evander in consequence ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 564" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>viii. 564</bibl>).

<head orig="Fescennīna">Fescennina</head>

 <p> sc. <seg lang="la">carmina.</seg> One of the earliest kinds of Italian poetry, which consisted of rude and jocose verses, or rather dialogues in extempore verses (<bibl n="Liv.  7. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vii. 2</bibl>), in which the merry country folks assailed and ridiculed one another ( <title>Epist.</title> ii. 1, 145). This amusement seems originally to have been peculiar to country people, but it was also introduced into the towns of Italy and at Rome, where it is found mentioned as one of those in which young people indulged at weddings ( <title>ad Aen.</title> vii. 695; Seneca, <title>Controv.</title> 21, <bibl n="Sen. Med. 113" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Med.</title>113</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 15. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xv. 22</bibl>). There are rather feeble specimens of these in the four poems by Claudian <title>De Nuptiis Honorii Augusti et Mariae.</title> The Fescennina were one of the popular amusements at various festivals, and on many other occasions, but especially after the harvest was over.</p>
 <p>After their introduction into the towns they seem to have lost much of their original rustic character, and perhaps were modified by the influence of Greek refinement (see  <bibl n="Verg. G. 2. 385" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>ii. 385</bibl>, etc.; Tibull. ii. 1, 55; <bibl n="Catul. 61.127" default="NO" valid="yes">Catull. lxi. 127</bibl>); they remained, however, in so far the same as to be at all times irregular and mostly extempore doggerel verses, usually in the Saturnian metre, though the specimens which are preserved are in trochaics, and the cretic is called <title>pes Fescenninus</title> by Diomedes, p. 479 (Keil). Sometimes, however, <title>versus Fescennini</title> were also written as satires upon persons (Macrob. <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 2. 4" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>ii. 4</bibl><bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 21" default="NO"> Sat., 21</bibl>). That these railleries had no malicious character, and were not intended to hurt or injure, may be inferred from the circumstance that one person often called upon another to answer and retort in a similar strain. The 
<pb n="667" /><cb /> Fescennina are asserted by Festus (s. h. v.) to have been introduced among the Romans from Etruria, and to have derived their name from Fescennia, a town of that country. But, in the first place, Fescennia was not an Etruscan, but a Faliscan town, and, in the second, this kind of amusement was at all times so popular in Italy that it can scarcely be considered as peculiar to any particular place. The derivation of a name of this kind from that of some particular place was formerly a favourite custom, as may be seen in the derivation of <seg lang="la">caerimonia</seg> from Caeré. Festus gives an alternative derivation from <seg lang="la">fascinum</seg>, either because they were thought to be a protection against sorcerers and witches, or because fascinum (<seg lang="la">phallus</seg>), the symbol of fertility, had in early times, or in rural districts, been connected with the amusements of the fescennina. This etymology is far more probable. Teuffel (<title>Rom. Lit.</title> 5) attempts to combine the two, suggesting that fescennia may have derived its name from <seg lang="la">fascinum.</seg> Nettleship (<title>Journ. Phil.</title> xi. 190) plausibly assumes a substantive <hi rend="italic">fescennus</hi>, “a charmer,” from <seg lang="la">fas</seg>, “saying”; hence <hi rend="italic">fescennini</hi> would be “the verses used by charmers.” See Müller, <title>Die Etrusker</title>, ii. 296; Zell, <title>Ferienschriften</title>, ii. 121; Broman, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Versibus Fescenninis</title> (Upsala, 1852)</bibl>; Corssen, <title>Origines Poësis</title>, etc., 124; <bibl default="NO">Rossbach, <title>Die römische Ehe</title> (1853)</bibl>; Nettleship, <title>Lectures and Essays</title>, pp. 60 foll. <bibl default="NO">(Oxford, 1885)</bibl>; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossmatrimonium">Matrimonium</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosssatura">Satura</ref>.

 <p> Properly any stem, stalk, or straw of grain, or blade of grass (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 31. 38). In two passages it is generally explained as a synonym of the praetor's rod (<seg lang="la">vindicta</seg>) laid upon the slave's head in <seg lang="la">manumissio</seg> (Plaut. <title>Mil.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sextus Pompēius</hi>. A grammarian, supposed to have lived before the third century A.D. He made an abridgment, in alphabetical order, of the large work of Verrius <ref type="cross" target="crossflaccus">Flaccus</ref> (q.v.), on the signification of words (<title>De Verborum Significatu</title>) —a rich storehouse of most important information on Roman antiquities and early Latin. This abridgment has been divided by editors into twenty books, each of which contains a letter. Festus has passed over in silence those words which Verrius had declared obsolete, and he intended, it would seem, to have treated of them in a separate work. Sometimes he does not coincide in the opinions of Verrius (e. g. on <seg lang="la">monstrum</seg>), and on these occasions he gives his own views of the <cb /> subject matter. The abridgment of Festus is one of the most useful books that we possess; it has experienced, however, in some respects, an unhappy fate. It existed entire down to the eighth century, when one Paul Warnefrid (commonly quoted as Paulus Diaconus) conceived the idea of making a small and meagre extract from it. This compilation, dedicated to Charlemagne, henceforward supplanted the original work in the libraries of the day, and the latter was so far lost to modern times that but a single manuscript copy (Codex Farnesinus, now in Naples) of it was found, and this an imperfect one, commencing with the letter M. It was brought from Illyria, and was first copied as a whole by Politian in 1485. The first edition of the epitome of Paulus was printed by Zarotus <bibl default="NO">(Milan, 1471)</bibl>.

<div2 id="crossfetiales" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Fetiāles">Fetiales</head>

 <p> A collegium (<bibl n="Liv.  36. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxvi. 3</bibl>) of Roman priests who acted as the guardians of the public faith. It was their province, when any dispute arose with a foreign State, to demand satisfaction, to determine the circumstances under which hostilities might be commenced, to perform the various rites attendant on the solemn declaration of war, and to preside at the formal ratification of peace. These functions are briefly but comprehensively defined by Varro (<title>L. L.</title> v. 86, ed. Müller), to which may be added the old law quoted by Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> ii. 9, 21): <hi rend="SmallCaps">Foedervm, pacis, belli, indvtiarvm oratores fetiales ivdicesqve svnto </hi> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">ivs noscvnto,</hi> <title>Madvig</title>); <hi rend="SmallCaps">bella disceptanto</hi>. Dionysius (ii. 72) and Livy (i. 32) detail at considerable length the ceremonies observed by the Romans in the earlier ages, when they felt themselves aggrieved by a neighbouring people. It appears that when an injury had been sustained, four fetiales (Varr. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. ) were deputed to seek redress, who again elected one of their number to act as their representative. This individual was styled the <title>pater patratus populi Romani.</title> They were dressed in the garb of priests, and a wreath of sacred herbs gathered within the enclosure of the 
<pb n="668" /><cb /> Capitoline Hill (<seg lang="la">verbenae, sagmina</seg>), was borne befor them by one of their number, who was hence called Verbenarius (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 22.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxii. 5</bibl>). Thus <figure id="fig.00668">
<head orig="Fetialis. (Rich.)">Fetialis. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> equipped, at least two of their number proceeded to the confines of the offending tribe, where they halted and the Pater Patratus addressed a prayer to Iupiter, calling the god to witness, with heavy imprecations, that his complaints were well founded and his demands reasonable. He then crossed the border, and the same form was repeated in nearly the same words to the first native of the soil whom he might chance to meet; again a third time to the sentinel or any citizen whom he encountered at the gate of the chief town; and a fourth time to the magistrates in the Forum in presence of the people. If a satisfactory answer was not returned within thirty days, after publicly delivering a solemn renunciation—in which the gods celestial, terrestrial, and infernal were invoked—of what might be expected to follow, he returned to Rome, and, accompanied by the rest of the fetiales, made a report of his mission to the Senate. If the people (<bibl n="Liv.  10. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, x. 45</bibl>), as well as the Senate, decided for war, the Pater Patratus again set forth to the border of the hostile territory, and launched a spear tipped with iron, or charred at the extremity and smeared with blood (emblematic doubtless of fire and slaughter) across the boundary, pronouncing at the same time a solemn declaration of war. The demand for redress and the proclamation of hostilities were alike termed <seg lang="la">clarigatio</seg>, which word the Romans in later times explained by <seg lang="la">clare repetere</seg> (Pliny , l. c.; <seg lang="la">Serv. ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. A. 9. 53" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>ix. 53</bibl><bibl n="Verg. A. 10. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. Aen., x. 14</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Liv.  8. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, viii. 14</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 5</bibl>). When the Romans had to carry on wars beyond the sea, this proceeding was inconvenient. Hence a characteristic device was adopted. They transferred a piece of land in the Circus Flaminius to a prisoner taken from the enemy, and set up on this before the Temple of Bellona a column, which was accounted as standing on hostile territory ( Serv. l. c.).</p>
 <p>Several of the formulae employed on these occasions have been preserved by Livy (i. 24<bibl n="Liv.  32" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 32</bibl>) and Aulus Gellius (xvi. 4), forming a portion of the Ius Fetiale by which the college was regulated. The services of the fetiales were considered absolutely essential in concluding a treaty (<bibl n="Liv.  9. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 5</bibl>); and we read that at the termination of the Second Punic War fetiales were sent over to Africa, who carried with them their own <seg lang="la">verbenae</seg> and their own flint stones for smiting the victim. Here also the chief was termed Pater Patratus (<bibl n="Liv.  30. 43" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxx. 43</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The institution of these priests was ascribed by tradition, in common with other matters connected with religion, to Numa ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 71" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 71</bibl>); and although Livy (i. 32) speaks as if he attributed their introduction to Ancus Martius, yet in an earlier chapter (i. 24) he supposes them to have existed in the reign of Hostilius. Little mention is made of the fetiales after the time of the Second Punic War, though the <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> is known to have existed as late as the second century A.D.</p>
 <p>The number of the fetiales cannot be ascertained with certainty, but Varro quoted by Nonius (xii. 43) states that it amounted to twenty; of whom <cb /> Niebuhr supposes ten were elected from the Ramnes and ten from the Titienses. They were originally selected from the most noble families; their office lasted for life ( <bibl n="Dionys.  2. 72" default="NO">Dionys.ii. 72</bibl>); and it seems probable that vacancies were filled up by the college (<hi rend="italic">coöptatione</hi>) until the passing of the Lex Domitia, when in common with most other priests they would be nominated in the Comitia Tributa. This, however, is nowhere expressly stated.</p>
 <p>The etymology of <seg lang="la">fetialis</seg> is uncertain. Varro (<title>L. L.</title> v. 86) would connect it with <seg lang="la">fidus</seg> and <seg lang="la">foedus;</seg> Festus with <seg lang="la">ferio</seg> or <seg lang="la">facio;</seg> but it is more probably connected with <seg lang="la">fateri</seg> and the Oscan <hi rend="italic">fatium</hi>, so that <seg lang="la">fetiales</seg> would=<seg lang="la">oratores</seg>, “speakers.” The spelling <hi rend="italic">feciales</hi> is incorrect.</p>
 <p>The explanation given by Livy (i. 24) of the origin of the title Pater Patratus is satisfactory: <title>Pater Patratus ad jusjurandum patrandum, id est, sanciendum fit foedus.</title>

Then, as clay played an <figure id="fig.00668.3">
<head orig="Brick Forms. (Rich.)">Brick Forms. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> important part in the preparation of works in bronze, the use of these words was extended to metal, and still further to statuary in stone and marble.

The original term for clay is <foreign lang="greek">κέραμος</foreign>, whence the forms <foreign lang="greek">κεραμεύς, κεραμεύω</foreign>, etc., applied not merely to the potter, but broadly to any worker in clay. From <foreign lang="greek">πηλός</foreign> (applied to the clay of the bricklayer, and also to that of the potter) we have <foreign lang="greek">πηλουργός, πηλοπλάθος</foreign>, corresponding to

 <p>The simplest, and at the same time one of the oldest, branches of the primeval art of working in clay is the manufacture of bricks (<seg lang="la">lateres</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">πλίνθοι</foreign>) and tiles (<seg lang="la">tegulae</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">κέραμοι</foreign>), the invention of which (at Athens) was ascribed by the Greeks to the mythical personages Euryalus and Hyperbius ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 194" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>vii. 194</bibl>), and to Talus, the nephew of Daedalus. So far as bricks were used at all, their use was generally confined to private buildings; and Greeks and Romans for ages employed only unbaked or sun-dried bricks. Bricks baked in the kiln came into use at a later date. The first to employ them extensively were the Romans, probably at the period when the population of the city <figure id="fig.00669">
<head orig="Tegulae of Baked Clay with maker's stamp. (Rich.)">Tegulae of Baked Clay with maker's stamp. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> rendered it necessary to build houses of several stories, which demanded a more solid material. In imperial times such bricks were the common material for private and public buildings. The walls were built of them, and then overlaid with stucco or marble. Building with baked bricks extended from Rome into Greece, and, generally speaking, wherever the Romans carried their arms they introduced their exceptional aptitude for making excellent bricks. Bricks which presented flat surfaces, to be used for walls or pavements, were made of the most varied dimensions, but were for the most part thinner than ours. Besides these, there were also rounded bricks for building dwarf columns, and for the construction of circular walls. For the Assyrian and Babylonian bricks, see the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossassyria">Assyria</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbabylonia">Babylonia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosscuneiform">Cuneiform</ref>.</p>
 <p>All that we know of the Greek method of brickmaking is that the earthy clay (<foreign lang="greek">πῆλος</foreign>) was carved out with trowels (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμαί</foreign>) and laid in mould; it was moistened with water and kneaded with the feet, put it is uncertain whether the bricks were modelled by hand or pressed into a mould. The Romans were careful in the selection of clay; they rejected sandy or stony clay, both on account of the weight and liability to damp; a whitish clay was preferred (<seg lang="la">terra albida, cretosa</seg>), or else a reddish clay (<seg lang="la">rubrica</seg>), or the softer kind of sandy loam (<seg lang="la">sabulo masculus</seg>). The special times for brick-making were spring or autumn; after baking it was usual to leave the bricks for some time to dry. Vitruvius recommends the use of those which are two years old and thoroughly dry; and quotes a law of Utica, ordaining that bricks for walls must be five years old. The clay was carefully purified, damped, and mixed with chopped straw; it was then either formed by the hand or pressed in a mould, and set to dry in the sun. In some parts of Spain and Asia Minor bricks are said to have been made so light that they would not sink in water.</p>
 <p>The usual size of bricks in Greece was 5 palms square (<foreign lang="greek">πεντάδωρα</foreign>) for public, and 4 palms square (<foreign lang="greek">τετράδωρα</foreign>) for private buildings; in Rome the size usually adopted was the <foreign lang="greek">γένος Λύδιον</foreign>, 1 1/2 Roman foot long by 1 foot broad (<seg lang="la">sesquipedales</seg>). Pal ladius recommends bricks of 2 Roman feet long (<seg lang="la">bipedales</seg>) by 1 foot broad and 4 inches high. In later times there seems to have been no definite rule as to size.<cb /></p>

</figure> were provided with a raised rim on both of their longer sides, and were so formed that the upper fitted into the lower. Concave tiles also were used (<seg lang="la">imbrex</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">καλυπτήρ</foreign>) of the form of a half-cylinder, which covered the adjoining edges of the flat tiles. The lowest row was commonly finished off with ornamental moulding. From the same material as bricks were also made pipes for conveying water for sewers, and for warm air; the section in the first two cases was round, in the last square.

 <p>Pottery in its proper sense, the manufacture of utensils, is very old. The potter's wheel was known even before Homer's time ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 600" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 600</bibl>), and was probably derived by the Greeks from Egypt. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref>, p. 26.) Corinth and Athens, where the neighbouring promontory of Colias furnished an inexhaustible supply of fine potter's clay, were, in fact, the headquarters of the manufacture of Greek pottery. Next came Aegina, Samos, Lacedaemon, and other places in Greece itself, which always remained the principal seat of this manufacture, especially in the form of vases of painted clay. These were exported in large numbers to the countries on the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The high estimation in which Greek, and especially Attic, pottery was held is proved by the numerous vases which have been discovered in tombs, chiefly in Italy. Moreover, they represent almost every period. The excel<figure id="fig.00669.3">
<head orig="Clay Quarry. (From a tablet at Berlin.)">Clay Quarry. (From a tablet at Berlin.)</head>
</figure> lence of the workmanship lies in the material, which is very fine, and prepared with the utmost care; also in the execution and in the baking. Its thinness as well as the hardness of its sides, even in vessels of large dimensions, astonishes experts in such matters. The shapes are mostly produced by the potter's wheel, but also by hand in the case of vessels too large to be conveniently placed on the wheel; for example, the largest wine-jars. The prehistoric pottery from Mycenae, the Troad, and other Hellenic sites, was also made by hand. Whereas small vessels were made of a single piece, in the case of large ones, the body, handles,

</figure>
 feet, and neck were fashioned separately, and then united. They were first dried in the sun, then twice baked, before and after the painting. The colours are no less admirable than the workmanship. The clay shows a beautiful bright reddish yellow, which is produced by the addition of colouring matter, and is also further intensified by a thin coating of glaze. The black colour, which often verges upon green and is of a brilliant lustre, is then applied. Either (1) the design stands out black against the bright background, or</p>
 <p>(2) the figures appear in red on a black ground, the former being the earlier method. Other colours, especially white or dark-red, were applied after the black glaze had been burned into the clay by the second baking, and served as a <figure id="fig.00670.2"><head>Archaic Vase with Owl Head and Characteristics of a Woman. (Schliemann, <title>Troja.</title>) </head></figure> less lasting adornment. In later times yellow, green, blue, brown, and gold were also used.</p>
 <p>In the case of vases with black figures, the vase was first turned on the wheel, and, in order to give it a surface of deeper red, clay finely ground and mixed with water to the consistency of cream, technically known as “slip,” was applied by a brush or otherwise while it was still revolving. The outline of the design was next roughly sketched, either with a point or in light-red ochre with a brush. The vase was then dried in the sun, and again put on the wheel, and the glaze, finely powdered and mixed with water, was applied to it with a brush as it revolved. The vase was then, in some cases, fired for the first time in the kiln in order to provide a smooth, almost non-absorbent surface for the use of the painter. The painter then put on the black-enamel figures and ornaments with a brush. After the firing of the enamel, the details <figure id="fig.00670.3">
<head orig="Archaic Greek Vases. (Birch.)">Archaic Greek Vases. (Birch.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> were drawn in by incised lines, cutting through the enamel down to the clay body of the vase.</p>
 <p>In vases with red figures, instead of the figures being painted in black, the ground was covered with black enamel and the figures left, showing the glazed red “slip” which covers the whole vase. This method produced a great artistic advance in the beauty of the figures, the details and inner lines of which could be executed with freedom and ease by brush-marked lines, instead of by the laborious process of cutting incised lines through the very hard black enamel.</p>
 <p>Lastly, the form deserves great praise. The vases of the best period present the most tasteful elegance of form, that is at once fine and strong, and the most delicate proportion of the various parts to each other and to the whole, without interfering with their practical utility. It was not until the times when taste had begun to degenerate that the fashion was introduced of giving to <figure id="fig.00670.4">

 <p>Among the votive tablets in the Louvre there are two from Corinth. The first of these represents an early Greek type of kiln, which is domed over, and has a space for the fuel on one side and a door in the side of the upper chamber, through which the pottery could be put in and withdrawn. The second shows a potter applying painted bands while the vessel revolves on the wheel.</p>
 <p>The ovens (<foreign lang="greek">κάμινοι</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">fornaces</hi>) for baking vases seem to have differed very little from those of the present day. The remains of such ovens, dating from a late Roman period, have been found in Germany, France, England, and Italy. The most perfect, perhaps, was that found in 1881, at the little Roman colonia situated between the villages of <figure id="fig.00671">

 <p>The following illustrations are from paintings on a number of <foreign lang="greek">πίνακες</foreign>, or small clay tablets, found at Penteskaphia near Corinth in 1879, and now in the Museum at Berlin. They date from the sixth century B.C.</p>

</figure> a brush or stick; if the ornament was engraved alone, this would have to be done while the clay was still moist; if painted, the vase would be first dried in the air.</p>
 <p>The Romans, with whom, as early as the time of the second king, Numa, a guild (<seg lang="la">collegium</seg>) of potters existed, neither had vessels of painted clay amongst their household goods, nor did they employ it for the ornamentation of their graves. In earlier times at least, they used only coarse and entirely unornamented ware. They imported artistically executed vases from their neighbours, the Etruscans. In the last hundred years of the Republic, as well as in the first hundred years <cb /> after Christ, the chief place for the manufacture of the red crockery generally used in households was Arretium (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 160" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 160</bibl>; <bibl n="Mart.  1. 54" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 54</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 6</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  14. 98" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., xiv. 98</bibl>; Dennis, <title>Etruria</title>, ii. 335). The ware of <figure id="fig.00671.3">
<head orig="Interior of Furnace. (Berlin tablet.)">Interior of Furnace. (Berlin tablet.)</head>
</figure> this place was distinguished by a coral-red colour, and was generally furnished with glaze and delicate reliefs; in fact, ornamentation in relief was widely employed in later Roman pottery. Very much valued was the domestic ware, called <title>vasa Samia</title>, which was an imitation of the earlier pottery brought from the island of Samos. It was formed of fine, red-coloured clay, baked very hard, of thin make, and very delicate workmanship. It was glazed and generally adorned with reliefs, and served especially for the table use of respectable people who could not afford silver.</p>
 <p>While this fine ware was made by hand, the manufacture of ordinary pottery, as well as of bricks and pipes, especially under the Empire, formed an important industry among capitalists. <figure id="fig.00671.4">

</figure> who, on finding good clay on their estates, built potteries and tile-works, and either worked them on their own account through slaves, or had them carried on by lessees. The emperor himself, after the time of Tiberius, and the members of the imperial family, especially the women, pursued a similar trade, as is shown by the trade-mark which, according to Roman custom, was borne by clay manufactures.</p>
 <p>The production of large statues of clay, apart from the purpose of modelling, belongs amongst the Greeks to the early times. It continued much longer amongst the Italians, especially amongst the Etruscans, who furnished the temples at Rome with clay images of the gods before the victorious campaigns in the East brought marble and bronze productions of Greek art to Rome. On the other hand, throughout the whole of antiquity, the manufacture of small clay figures of very various kinds, for the decoration of dwellings and graves, and for playthings for children, etc., was most extensively practised. They were generally made in moulds, and after baking were decorated with a coating of colour. The excellence which Greek art attained in this department, as in others, is shown by the “figurines” discovered at Tanagra in and after 1874. Very important, too, was the manufacture of clay reliefs, partly with figured representation

 <p>A Pythagorean philosopher of high reputation, who flourished about sixty years B.C. He was so celebrated on account of his knowledge that Gellius does not hesitate to pronounce him, next to Varro, the most learned of the Romans. Mathematical and physical investigations appear to have occupied a large share of his attention; and such was his fame as an astrologer that it was generally believed, in later times at least, that he had predicted in the most unambiguous 
<pb n="673" /><cb /> terms the future greatness of Octavianus on hearing the announcement of his birth. In the Eusebian Chronicle he is styled “Pythagoricus et Magus.” He, moreover, possessed considerable influence in political affairs during the last struggles of the Republic; was one of the senators selected by Cicero to take down the depositions and examinations of the witnesses who gave evidence with regard to Catiline's conspiracy, B.C. 63; was praetor in B.C. 59; took an active part in the civil war on the side of Pompey; was compelled in consequence by Caesar to live abroad, and died in exile B.C. 44. A letter of consolation addressed to him by Cicero (<title>Ad Fam.</title> iv. 13) is extant.</p>
 <p>Aulus Gellius, who entertained the strongest admiration for the talents and acquirements of Figulus, says that his works were little studied, and were of no practical value, in consequence of the subtlety and obscurity by which they were characterized; but the quotations adduced by him (xix. 14) as specimens scarcely bear out the charge, when we consider the nature of the subject.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">θύσανοι</foreign>; in grammarians also <foreign lang="greek">κροσσοί</foreign>). Tassels; a fringe. When the weaver had finished any garment on the loom (see <ref type="cross" target="crosstela">Tela</ref>), the thrums, i.e. the extremities of the threads of the warp, hung in a row at the bottom. In this state they were frequently left, being considered ornamental. Often also, to prevent them from ravelling, and to give a still more artificial and ornamental appearance, they were separated into bundles, each of which was twisted, and tied in one or more knots. The thrums were thus, by a very simple process, transformed into a row of tassels. The linen shirts found in Egyptian tombs sometimes show this ornament along their lower edge, and illustrate, in a very interesting manner, the description of these garments by Herodotus (ii. 81). Among the Greeks and Romans fringes were seldom worn except by women (Pollux, vii. 64). We find, however, a long-sleeved tunic with <seg lang="la">fimbriae</seg> at the wrists, worn by Iulius Caesar ( <title>Iul.</title> 45; cf. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Clavus Latus</hi>).

Firmus is described as having been of extraordinary stature and strength of body. His aspect was so forbidding that he obtained in derision the surname of Cyclops. His life was written by Vopiscus.

 <p> (from <seg lang="la">flare</seg>, one who blows or kindles the sacrificial fire; or from the root of <seg lang="la">flagro</seg>, to burn). The special priest of a special deity among the Romans ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 8). There were fifteen flamines—three higher ones (<seg lang="la">flamines maiores</seg>) of patrician rank: these were the <title>flamen Dialis</title> (of Iupiter), <title>Martialis</title> (of Mars), and <title>Quirinalis</title> (of Quirinus). The remaining twelve were <seg lang="la">flamines minores</seg>, plebeians, and attached to less important deities, as Vulcanus, Flora, Pomona, and Carmenta. Their office was for life, and they could be deprived of it only in certain cases. The emblem of their dignity was a white conical hat (<seg lang="la">apex</seg>) made out of the hide of a sacrificed animal, and having an olive branch and woollen thread at the top. This the flamines were obliged to wear always out of doors—indeed, the <title>flamen Dialis</title> had originally to wear it indoors as well. They were exempted from all the duties of civic life, and excluded at the same time from all participation in politics. In course of time they were allowed to hold urban offices, but even then they were forbidden to go out of Italy.</p>
 <p>The flamen Dialis was originally not allowed to spend a night away from home; in later times, <figure id="fig.00675">
<head orig="Coin of a Flamen Martialis. (Spanheim)">Coin of a Flamen Martialis. (Spanheim)</head>
</figure> under the Empire, the pontifex could allow him to sleep out for two nights in the year. Indeed, the flamen Dialis, whose superior position among the flamens conferred upon him certain privileges, as the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, a seat in the Senate, and the services of a lictor, was in proportion obliged to submit to more restrictions than the rest. He, his wife, their children, and his house on the Palatine were dedicated to this god. He must be born of a marriage celebrated by <seg lang="la">confarreatio</seg>, and live himself in indissoluble marriage. If his wife died, he resigned his office. In the performance of his sacred functions he was assisted by his children as <seg lang="la">camilli.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscamillus">Camillus</ref>.) Every day was for him a holy day, so that he never appeared without the insignia of his office, the conical hat, the thick woollen <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg> woven by his wife, the sacrificial knife, and a rod to keep the people away from him. He was preceded by his lictor, and by heralds who called on the people to stop their work, as the flamen was not permitted to look upon any labour. He was not allowed to set eyes on an armed host; to mount, or even to touch, a horse; to touch a corpse, or grave, or a goat, or a dog, or raw meat, or anything unclean. He must not have near him or behold anything in the shape of a chain; consequently there must be no knots, but only clasps, on his raiment; the ring on his finger was broken, and any one who came into his house with chains must instantly be loosened. <cb /> If he were guilty of any carelessness in the sacrifices, or if his hat fell from his head, he had to resign. His wife, the <seg lang="la">flaminica</seg>, was priestess of Iuno. She had, in like manner, to appear always in her insignia of office—a long woollen robe, with her hair woven with a purple fillet (<seg lang="la">tutulum</seg>) and arranged in pyramidal form, her head covered with a veil and a kerchief, and carrying a sacrificial knife. On certain days she was forbidden to comb her hair. The chief business of the flamines consisted in daily sacrifices; on certain special occasions they acted with the pontifices and the Vestal Virgins. The three superior flamines offered a sacrifice to Fides Publica at the Capitol on the Kalends of October, driving there in a two-horse chariot. During the imperial period flamines of the deified emperors were added to the others. See the illustration under <ref type="cross" target="crossapex">Apex</ref>.

<head orig="Flaminīnus">Flamininus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus Quinctius</hi>. A distinguished Roman general, made consul B.C. 198, before he was thirty years of age, and had the province of Macedonia assigned to him, with the charge of continuing the war against Philip, which had then lasted for two years, without any definite success on the part of the Romans. In his first campaign he drove Philip from the banks of the Aoüs, and, among other important movements, succeeded in detaching the Achaeans from the Macedonian alliance. In the following year Flamininus, being confirmed by the Senate in his command as proconsul, before commencing hostilities afresh, held a conference with Philip on the coast of the Maliac Gulf, and allowed him to send ambassadors to Rome to negotiate a peace. These negotiations, however, proving fruitless, Flamininus marched into Thessaly, where Philip had taken up a position, and totally defeated him in the battle of Cynoscephalae, in a spot broken by small hills, between Pherae and Larissa. The Macedonians lost 8000 killed and 5000 prisoners. After granting peace to the Macedonian monarch on severe and humiliating terms, Flamininus was continued in his command for another year, B.C. 196, to see these conditions executed. In that year, at the meeting of the Isthmian Games, where multitudes had assembled from every part of Greece, Flamininus caused a crier to proclaim, “that the Senate and people of Rome, and their commander Titus Quinctius, having subdued Philip and the Macedonians, now restored the Corinthians, Phocians, Locrians, Euboeans, Thessalians, Achaeans, etc., to their freedom and independence, and to the enjoyment of their own laws.” Bursts of applause followed this announcement, and the crowd pressed forward to express their gratitude to Flamininus, whose conduct throughout these memorable transactions was marked by a wisdom, moderation, and liberality seldom found united in a victorious Roman general. He was thus the means of prolonging the independence of the Greek States for half a century more. In the following year, B.C. 195, Flamininus was intrusted with the war against Nabis, tyrant of Lacedaemon, who had treacherously seized upon the city of Argos. The Roman commander marched into Laconia, and laid siege to Sparta, but met with a brave resistance, and at last agreed to grant peace to Nabis on condition that he should give up Argos and all the other 
<pb n="676" /><cb />
 places which he had usurped, and restore their lands to the descendants of the Messenians. His motives for granting peace to Nabis were, he said, partly to prevent the destruction of one of the most illustrious of the Greek cities, and partly the great preparations which Antiochus, king of Syria, was then making on the coast of Asia. Livy suggests, as another probable reason, that Flamininus wished to terminate the war himself, and not to give time to a new consul to supersede him and reap the honours of the victory. The Senate confirmed the peace with Nabis, and in the following year, B.C. 194, Flamininus, having settled the affairs of Greece, prepared to return to Italy. Having repaired to Corinth, where deputations from all the Grecian cities had assembled, he took a friendly leave of them, withdrew his garrisons from all their cities, and left them to the enjoyment of their own freedom. On returning to Italy, both he and his soldiers were received with great demonstrations of joy, and the Senate decreed him a triumph for three days. Before the chariot of Flamininus, in the celebration of this triumph, appeared, among the hostages, Demetrius, son of Philip, and Armenes, son of Nabis; and in the rear followed the Roman prisoners, who had been sold as slaves to the Greeks by Hannibal during the Second Punic War, and whose liberation Flamininus had obtained from the gratitude of the Grecian States. The Achaeans alone are said to have liberated 1200, for whom they paid 100 talents (about $110,000) as compensation-money to their masters. In the year B.C. 183, Flamininus was sent to Prusias, king of Bithynia, upon the ungracious mission of demanding the person of Hannibal, then in his old age, and a refugee at the court of Prusias. The monarch was prevailed upon to violate the claims of hospitality, but the Carthaginian prevented this treachery by destroying himself with poison. In the year B.C. 168, Flamininus was made augur, in the room of C. Claudius deceased (Livy , xlv. 44), after which he is no longer mentioned in history ( <title>Flamin.</title>).

</figure> April and beginning of May. It greatly degenerated, however, in the course of time, and became so offensive to purity as not to bear the presence of virtuous characters. The story of Cato the Censor in relation to this festival is well known (Val. Max. ii. 10). The Romans, who in general displayed great crudity in the legends which they invented for their deities, said that Flora had been a courtesan, who, having acquired immense wealth at Rome in the early days of the Republic, left it to the Roman people, on condition of their always celebrating her birthday with feasts ( <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 35; Lactant. 1, 24).

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Florāles Ludi.</hi> A festival which was celebrated at Rome in honour of Flora or Chloris. It was said to have been instituted in B.C. 238, on the occasion of the dedication of a temple to Flora by the aediles L. and M. Publicius in the Circus Maximus (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. 392), at the command of an oracle in the Sibylline Books, for the purpose of obtaining from the goddess her protection of the blossoms ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18.  286" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 286</bibl>). In the consulship of L. Postumius Albinus and M. Popilius Laenas (B.C. 173), it was made an annual festival, at the command of the Senate, by the aedile C. Servilius (Mommsen, <title>Röm. Münzw.</title> p. 645), as the blossoms in that year had severely suffered from winds, hail, and rain. By degrees it was extended to six days (April 28-May 3).</p>
 <p>The celebration was, as usual, conducted by the aediles, and was carried on with excessive merriment, drinking, and lascivious games ( <bibl n="Mart.  1. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.i. 3</bibl>; <title>Epist.</title> 96). From Valerius Maximus we learn that theatrical and mimic representations formed <cb /> a principal part of the various amusements, and that it was customary for the assembled people on this occasion to require the actresses to appear naked on the stage, and to amuse the multitude with indecent gestures and dances. The last day was devoted to a beast-hunt in the Circus, but there were no races. Similar festivals, chiefly in spring and autumn, are in Southern countries seasons for rejoicing, and, as it were, called forth by the season of the year itself, without any distinct connection with any particular divinity; they are to this day very popular in Italy, and in ancient times we find them celebrated from the southern to the northern extremity of Italy. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossanthesphoria">Anthesphoria</ref>, and Justin, xliii. 4.) The Floralia were originally festivals of the country people (Preller, <title>Röm. Myth.</title> 379), which were afterwards, in Italy as in Greece, introduced into the towns, where they naturally assumed a more dissolute and licentious character, while the country people continued to celebrate them in their old and merry but innocent manner; and it is highly probable that such festivals did not become connected with the worship of any particular deity until a comparatively late period. This would account for the late introduction of the Floralia at Rome, as well as for the manner in which we find them celebrated there.

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Annaeus</hi> (in one MS. called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iulius</hi>), a Latin historian, who was born, according to the common opinion, in Spain, but, as others maintain, in Gaul, and who wrote in the reign of Trajan. He was still living in the time of Hadrian, and is perhaps the same individual to whom, according to Spartianus, this emperor addressed some sportive verses. Florus has left an abridgment of Roman History, entitled <title>Epitome de Gestis Romanorum</title>, divided into two (in some MSS. four) books. It commences with the origin of Rome, and extends to <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 725, when Augustus closed the Temple of Ianus, a ceremony which had not taken place for 206 years previous. This work is based not merely upon Livy , but upon many earlier historians, no part of whose works any longer remains. It is less a history than a eulogy of the Roman people, written with elegance, but at the same time, in an oratorical style, and not without affectation. Oftentimes facts are merely hinted at, and events are passed over with a flourish of rhetoric; while the declamatory tone which everywhere prevails, and the concise and sententious phrases in which Florus is fond of indulging, impart an air of formality to his writings, and render them monotonous, and sometimes obscure. Florus likewise commits many errors of a geographical nature, and on many occasions is defective in point of chronology. His text has reached us in a very corrupt state, and abounds with interpolations. The epitome was very popular in the Middle Ages. The best edition of Florus is that of Jahn <bibl default="NO">(1852)</bibl>, revised by Halm <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1854)</bibl>. See Heyn, <bibl default="NO"><title>De Floro Historico</title> (Bonn, 1866)</bibl>; Bizos, <title>Flori Hist.</title>

Florus is possibly identical with the author of a school theme on Vergil, of which the introduction has been preserved, and is printed in Halm's edition of the epitome, and with the poet on whom Hadrian cracked the joke preserved by Spartianus ( <bibl n="Ael.

<head orig="Foederātae Civitātes, Foederāti, Socii">Foederatae Civitates, Foederati, Socii</head>

 <p> In extending her influence and dominions beyond the seven hills, Rome followed two alternative courses. One was to conclude a treaty of alliance with a community between which and herself there had previously been no relation; the other was to reduce such community to complete subjection by conquest or enforced surrender (<bibl n="Liv.  34. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiv. 17</bibl>; iv. 30; viii. 2). Where there was a treaty of alliance (<seg lang="la">foedus</seg>), the allied community was described by the terms prefixed to this article. At first, of course, such allies were exclusively Italian; in particular the Socii and Latini, who forced on the Social War, B.C. 90, though no town which had obtained the Roman civitas, or which was a Roman or Latin colony (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscolonia">Colonia</ref>), was said to be foederata. But even long before that war Rome had attached allies to herself by treaty outside Italy, both states governed on the republican principle and foreign princes (e. g. Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, B.C. 273, Dio Cass. 147; and Hiero of Syracuse, a year later, Polyb. i. 16). After the extension of the Roman imperium into the provinces, two kinds of foederati populi or civitates have to be distinguished: those whose territory lay within the bounds of a Roman province, and those which were genuinely foreign. The latter, however, after the subjection of the kings of Macedon and Syria, were constantly becoming mere tribute-payers to Rome (Livy , xlii. 6; xlv. 13<bibl n="Liv.  44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 44</bibl>), and as a general rule had to be content with concealing their practical vassalage (Sall. <title>Iug.</title> 14) under the thin disguise of “friends and allies of the Roman people” ( <title>B. G.</title> i. 3, 35, 43; iv. 12; vii. 31; <title>Pro Lege Manilia</title>, 5, 12).</p>
 <p>The foedera were of three kinds, stipulating merely for friendship between the contracting parties, or for reciprocal hospitality, or for military subvention. Those of the first kind (Polyb. iii. 22; <bibl n="Liv.  38. 38" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxviii. 38</bibl>) provided that the two States should not engage in war with one another without first making every attempt at an amicable settlement (e. g. the treaty with Alba, <bibl n="Dionys.  3. 3" default="NO">Dionys.iii. 3</bibl>), and contained regulations as to the sojourn of the citizens of each on the territory of the other, and the measure of legal protection they should enjoy (e. g. Carthage, Polyb. iii. 22-24). Other terms in 
<pb n="679" /><cb />
 such treaties, especially when concluded after a war, are exemplified by those with Carthage after the Sicilian and Second Punic Wars, with Philip of Macedon, and with Antiochus. Treaties of the second kind, which bargained for greater intimacy between the two States, are exemplified by that with the Aedui ( <title>B. G.</title> i. 31). Those providing for military assistance varied with the power and eminence of the allied State; sometimes they placed the parties on an absolute equality (<bibl n="Liv.  34. 57" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiv. 57</bibl>) —e. g. those with Camerinum and Heraclea, with the Aetolians, the Jews (Iosephus, <title>Ant. Iud.</title> xii. 10, 6), and Rhodians; in other cases the <seg lang="la">socius</seg> was subordinated to Rome, being required to “respect her majesty” ( <title>Pro Balb.</title> 16, 35; <title>Dig.</title> xlix. 15, 7, 1); it remained free, but practically was at Rome's orders, as a client at those of his patron, though the Romans admitted their obligation to afford full protection (<bibl n="Liv.  30. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxx. 42</bibl>), and included the <seg lang="la">socius</seg> in their own treaties with neighbouring peoples (Polyb. iii. 22 foll., xv. 18; <bibl n="Liv.  30. 37" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxx. 37</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  38. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxviii. 11</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  38" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 38</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The condition of the socii and foederati was originally one of tolerable independence, subject to the obligation of furnishing a contingent to the Roman army; but it was continuously depressed by the increasing power of Rome, and the resulting discontent culminated in the Social War, at the termination of which the Leges Iulia and Plautia Papiria brought the Roman civitas within the reach of all who were domiciled in Italy (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscivitas">Civitas</ref>), from whose territories this class of community now disappeared. Civitates foederatae seem, however, to have acquired the benefits of these statutes only on condition of becoming <seg lang="la">fundus</seg> (see below).</p>
 <p>There were also foederatae civitates in most of the provinces, their treaty of course being anterior to the formation of the province itself; thus there were three in both Sicily and Baetica, and others in Asia Minor; Athens, Rhodes, and Tyre were also federate towns, and Cicero (<title>Pro Scauro</title>, 44) regards it as a dishonour to Sardinia that in all that island there was no town which “was free and united by friendship with the Roman people.” These federate towns in the provinces enjoyed certain privileges not shared by the ordinary provincial town. Their citizens were exempted from payment of the land impost (<seg lang="la">vectigal</seg>), and perhaps from some of the other ordinary taxes of the State; and they possessed <foreign lang="greek">αὐτονομία</foreign>, the independent control of their own affairs, with some measure of legislative and judicial power, excluding the authority of the provincial governor; but this perhaps was more theoretical than practical, especially when a Roman army came their way ( <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Pomp.</title>10</bibl>). It is hardly necessary to say that the foederatae civitates were forbidden to embark on any independent foreign policy. They were free to adopt the civil law of Rome in whole or part. Thus even before the Social War it was not unusual for the Socii and Latini to adopt Roman laws into their own system. In such cases the State which adopted a Roman statute was said <seg lang="la">in eam legem fundus fieri;</seg> but of course it did not thereby obtain for its citizens any privileges with respect to the Roman State.

 <p>(4) Under the later Empire, follis was the name of a small debased coin. In the absence of a better currency, large sums had to be paid in this coinage, which for the purpose was done up in bags, also called <seg lang="la">folles</seg>, analogous to the “purses of piastres” still used in reckoning in the East. The number of coins that went to a bag was probably 500, and its worth 1/12 of a <seg lang="la">solidus</seg>, or about $0.25. From this the follis became, under Constantine and his successors, a “money of account,” which was used in reckoning gold and silver as well as copper (Euseb. <title>H. E.</title> x. 6. 1; Cod. Theod. vi. 2, 8).

 <p>A distinguished Italian lexicographer, born near Padua, August 26th, 1688. Being of humble parentage, he had few opportunities for early training, so that he was of mature age when he began a course of advanced study in the philological seminary of Padua under <ref type="cross" target="crossfacciolati">Facciolati</ref> (q.v.). His great ability, zeal, and industry, however, soon gave him an honourable rank, so that he was appointed an assistant to his teacher, with whom his name is inseparably associated in their joint work, the great Latin lexicon (<title>Totius Latinitatis Lexicon</title>) whose completion was in great part due to the untiring labour of Forcellini. Notebook in hand, he read through not only the entire body of Latin literature, but also the whole collection of inscriptions, including those on coins and medals, and thus compiled the most comprehensive and valuable vocabulary of the language that had ever been made, with both the Greek and the Italian equivalent of every word. The lexicon appeared in 1771 in 4 vols., three years after Forcellini's death, which occurred April 4th, 1768. Besides this <seg lang="la">magnum opus</seg>, Forcellini had assisted his master in the preparation of the so-called Calepine Vocabulary, and from 1724 to 1731 was Professor of Rhetoric in the seminary at Ceneda.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Τύχη</foreign>). The goddess of good luck, worshipped from remote antiquity in Italy. Her cultus 
<pb n="682" /><cb /> was supposed to have been introduced into Rome by King Servius Tullius, popularly believed to be her favourite and confidant. He was said to have founded her oldest sanctuaries, as, for instance, that of Fors Fortuna, or lucky chance, on the right bank of the Tiber below Rome. To this a pilgrimage was made down the river by land and water on the anniversary of its foundation (June 26). As time went on, the worship of Fortuna became one of the most popular in Italy. She was worshipped at a great number of shrines under various titles given according to the various circumstances of life in which her influence was supposed to have effect. These titles were <title>Fortuna Primigenia</title>, who determines the destiny of the child at its birth; <title>Fortuna Publica</title> or <title>Populi Romani</title>, the tutelary goddess of the State; <title>Fortuna Caesaris</title> or <title>Augusta</title>, the protectress of the emperor; <title>Fortuna Privata</title>, or of family life; <title>Fortuna Patricia, Plebeia, Equestris</title>, of the different orders, classes, and families of the population; <title>Fortuna Liberûm</title>, of children; <title>Virginalis</title>, of maidens; <title>Muliebris</title>, of women. <title>Fortuna Virilis</title> was the goddess of woman's happiness in married life, of boys and of youths, who dedicated to her the first cuttings of their beards, calling her from this <title>Fortuna Barbata.</title> Other epithets of Fortuna were <title>Victrix</title>, or giver of victory; <title>Conservatrix</title>, or preserver; <title>Dux</title> or <title>Comes</title>, the leader or attendant; <title>Redux</title>, who brings safe home; <title>Tranquilla</title>, the giver of prosperous voyages. This Fortuna was worshipped with Portunus in the harbour of Rome. There were also <title>Fortuna Bona</title> and <title>Mala</title>, good and evil Fortune; <title>Blanda</title> or flattering, <title>Obsequens</title> or yielding, <title>Dubia</title> or doubtful, <title>Viscata</title> or enticing, <title>Brevis</title> or fickle, and <title>Manens</title> or constant. Trajan at last founded a special temple in her honour as the allpervading power of the world. Here an annual sacrifice was offered to her on New Year's Day.

 <p> A word which first signified an open space (<hi rend="italic">area</hi>) before any building, especially before a sepulchre ( Fest. s. v.). It is no doubt connected with <seg lang="la">foris</seg>, and so means any place “out of doors.” The characteristic features of a Roman forum were, that it was a levelled space of ground of an oblong form, and surrounded by buildings, houses, temples, basilicas or porticoes (Vitruv. v. 1, 2). The forum at Pompeii, now completely excavated and showing very handsome architectural surroundings, affords a good general notion of the usual appearance of these places and the way they were laid out. A forum was originally used as a place where justice was administered, and where goods were exhibited for sale (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 145). One must accordingly distinguish between two kinds of fora, of which some were real marketplaces, while others were places of meeting for the popular assembly and for the courts of justice. Mercantile business, however, was not altogether excluded from the latter, and it was especially the bankers and usurers who kept their shops in the buildings and porticoes by which they were surrounded. The latter kinds of fora were sometimes called <seg lang="la">fora iudicialia</seg>, to distinguish them from the mere market-places.</p>
 <p>Among the <seg lang="la">fora iudicialia</seg> the most important was the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Romānum</hi>, which was simply called <title>Forum</title>, as long as it was the only one of its kind which existed at Rome. At a late period of the Republic, and during the Empire when other <seg lang="la">fora iudicialia</seg> were built, the Forum Romanum was distinguished from them by the epithets <seg lang="la">vetus</seg> or <seg lang="la">magnum.</seg> It was situated between the Palatine, the Capitoline, and the Quirinal Hills, and its extent was seven <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> i. 2). It was originally a swamp or marsh, but was said to have been filled up by Romulus and Tatius, and to have been set apart as a place for the administration of justice, for the assemblies of the people, and for other kinds of public business. It was drained by the construction of the Cloaca Maxima in the time of the last kings. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossemissarium">Emissarium</ref>.) In the larger sense, as applied to the whole valley surrounded by the three hills just named, the Forum included the Comitium, or the open place of assembly for the curiae (Varro, <title>L. L.</title> v. 155) in the centre of the Forum proper. Ancient rostra were an elevated platform (<seg lang="la">suggestum</seg>), from which the orators addressed the people, and which derived their name from the circumstance that, after the subjugation of Latium, the sides of the platform were adorned with the beaks (<seg lang="la">rostra</seg>) of the ships of 
<pb n="683" /><cb />
 the Antiates (<bibl n="Liv.  8. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, viii. 14</bibl>). In subsequent times, when the curiae had lost their importance, the accurate distinction between Comitium and Forum likewise ceased, and the Comitia Tributa were sometimes held in the Circus Flaminius; but towards the end of the Republic the Forum seems to have been chiefly used for judicial proceedings, and as a sort of Exchange. The orators, when addressing the people from the rostra, and even the tribunes of the people in the early times of the Republic, used to front the Comitium and the Curia; but C. Gracchus, or perhaps C. Licinius, introduced the custom of facing the Forum, thereby acknowledging the sovereignty of the people. In B.C. 308 the Romans adorned the Forum, or rather the bankers' shops (<seg lang="la">argentariae</seg>) around, with the gilded shields which they had taken from the Samnites: and this custom of adorning the Forum with these shields and other ornaments was subsequently always observed during the time of the Ludi Romani, when the aediles rode in their chariots (<seg lang="la">tensae</seg>) in solemn procession around the Forum (<bibl n="Liv.  9. 40" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 40</bibl>). After the victory of C. Duilius over the Carthaginians the Forum was adorned with the celebrated <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna-rostrata">Columna Rostrata</ref> (q.v.). In the upper part of the Forum, or the Comitium, the laws of the Twelve Tables were exhibited for public inspection, and it was probably in the same part that in B.C. 304 Cn. Flavius exhibited the Fasti, written on white tables (<seg lang="la">in albo</seg>), that every citizen might be able to know the days on which the law allowed the administration of justice. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdies">Dies</ref>.) Besides the ordinary business which was carried on in the Forum, we read that gladiatorial games were held in it (Vitruv. v. 1, 2), and that prisoners of war and faithless colonists or legionaries were put to death there (<bibl n="Liv.  7. 19" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, vii. 19</bibl>; <bibl n="Liv. 9.24" default="NO" valid="yes">ix. 24</bibl>; <bibl n="Liv. 28.28" default="NO" valid="yes">xxviii. 28</bibl>). <cb /> Down to the latest times of the Republic, the Forum was the usual place where funeral games were given; on these occasions it was temporarily enclosed with wooden railings ( <title>Pro Sest.</title> 58, 124). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscancelli">Cancelli</ref>.</p>
 <p>The ancient structures in the Forum were restored by Theodoric in the sixth century A.D., and down to the eighth century the original level was unchanged; but during the Middle Ages the magnificent edifices of ancient Rome were used as a quarry from which churches and secular buildings drew their building-stones, marbles, columns, and even their lime, which was derived from burning the ancient marble in kilns. Still more eagerly were the bronzes appropriated, so that it is not surprising that so few works of art, comparatively, have survived. In the eleventh century, the Forum was covered with the towers and fortress-walls of the mediaeval nobles, and the ultimate demolition of these covered the ground with a layer of rubbish to which fresh deposits were continuously made, especially when new buildings were reared and new streets constructed. The result is that the original level is now in some places fully forty feet below the surface. From the Middle Ages down to the present century, the site of the Forum was called Campo Vaccino. Its desolate area was given up to the buffaloes and oxen of the peasantry, to the scattered workshops of the meaner artisans, and to the few ruined columns that protruded from the rubbish as a melancholy reminiscence of its former glories. Such investigations and excavations as were first made under Raphael <bibl default="NO">(especially in 1546-47)</bibl> were undertaken solely in the search for works of art, and the trenches were soon refilled; but in the present century, more scientific research began. In 1803 the Arch of 
<pb n="684" /><cb /> Septimius Severus (see page 118), in 1813 the Column of Phocas, and in 1816-19 the Capitoline Hill with its temples were disinterred by Carlo Fea. Subsequently to 1835, the Basilica Iulia was in part recovered by Canina, and since 1871, when the Italian government occupied Rome as the capital of Italy, the work of excavation has been pushed with vigour. The Temples of Castor, Caesar, Faustina, Vespasian, etc., the Atrium Vestae, and the rest of the Basilica have been exhumed, besides a good part of the adjacent streets.</p>
 <p>In the period between Iulius Caesar and Trajan the five imperial fora were erected.</p>
 <p>(1) The first of these, and the second <seg lang="la">forum iudiciarium</seg>, was built by the dictator Caesar out of the spoils of the Gallic War, and was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Caesăris</hi> or <ref type="cross" target="crossiulii">Iulii</ref>. The site chosen was exceptionally crowded and valuable, immediately to the northeast of the Forum Romanum, and a hundred million sesterces ($4,000,000) were paid for it. The levelling of the ground cost large additional sums; in the centre stood the magnificent temple of Venus Genetrix, the tutelary goddess of Caesar's family, which he had vowed at the battle of Pharsalia ( <title>Iul.</title> 26). Nothing now remains of this Forum but five half-buried arches.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Augusti</hi>, the next in date, stood back from the Forum Iulii in the same direction. The central area was occupied by the temple of Mars Ultor, commemorating the battle of Philippi, though it was not finished until forty years later, and dedicated in B.C. 2 (Vell. Pat. ii. 109. 2). Augustus further adorned his Forum with statues of the most distinguished men of the Republic, and issued a decree that only the <seg lang="la">iudicia publica</seg> and the <seg lang="la">sortitiones iudicum</seg> should take place in it ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>29</bibl> and 31). After the Forum Augusti had severely suffered by fire, it was restored by Hadrian ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 19" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>19</bibl>).
 </p>
 <p>(3) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Pacis</hi> was built to enclose the Temple of Peace, dedicated by Vespasian A.D. 75. It commemorated the close of the civil wars which had filled the short reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, the undisputed authority of the emperor, and the taking of Jerusalem ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 9" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>9</bibl>; Dio Cass. lxvi. 15). According to Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  102" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 102</bibl>) the three most magnificent buildings in Rome were the Basilica of Paullus, the Forum of Augustus, and Vespasian's Temple of Peace. The site was to the southeast of the Forum of Augustus, but did not quite join it, a wide street from the Subura to the Forum Romanum being left between. This narrow strip afterwards became the Forum Transitorium of Nerva. There are no remains of the Temple of Peace.
 </p>
 <p>(4) The situation of the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum of </hi> Nerva has been already indicated. It was called <hi rend="SmallCaps">Transitorium</hi>, on account of the highway which ran through it; or <ref type="cross" target="crosspalladium">Palladium</ref>, from containing a Temple of Minerva. The two Corinthian columns, buried to about half <cb /> their height, and now called Colonnacce, belonged to this temple; part of the outer wall of the Forum is also extant.
 </p>
 <p>(5) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Traiāni</hi> was probably the most magnificent of all. It occupied a large space between the Capitoline and Quirinal Hills, the latter of which was cut back to a height of 100 Roman feet, as shown by the inscription on the Column of Trajan. The entrance was at the lower or southern end, where a triumphal arch, surmounted by a statue of Trajan in a six-horse chariot, divided it from the Forum of Augustus. The open space was surrounded by a double row of porticos, and enlarged by four enormous apses or semicircular extensions, one of which can still be traced in the slope of the Quirinal. In the centre stood the Basilica Ulpia, which fills the greater part of the modern Foro Traiano; beyond it was a cloistered court (<seg lang="la">atrium</seg>) surrounding the celebrated column which bears Trajan's name, and flanked by two libraries—one for Greek, the other for Latin MSS. At the upper end it was closed by the Temple of Trajan, dedicated by his successor. The splendour of the Forum Traiani greatly impressed the later Romans. Ammianus Marcellinus, in an account of a visit made to Rome by the emperor Constantius, describes a guest of that prince, a Persian, as amazed by this great work, “so exquisite,” says the historian, “that the gods themselves would find it hard to refuse their admiration” (xvi. 14).</p>
 <p>Different from these fora were the numerous markets at Rome, some of them reaching back to a very high antiquity. The most important was the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Boarium</hi>, or cattle market, occupying a large space between the Velabrum and the Tiber; the notion that it derived its name from the statue of an ox, whencesoever imported (Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 6. 477" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Fast.</title>vi. 477</bibl>), can hardly be right, as it was almost certainly so named long before statues were introduced at Rome. Others which took their names from the goods sold in them were the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Forum Olitorium</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Piscatorium</hi>, for vegetables and fish, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Suarium</hi> for pigs, <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cupedĭnis</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cupedinarium</hi> for dainties.</p>
 <p>Of the Forum Romanum the bearings and dimensions form one of the most disputed points of Roman topography. The excavations at Pompeii, however, have opened the Forum of that city, the remains of which are sufficiently preserved to enable us to trace the ground-plans of the various edifices surrounding it, and to assign some probable use to each of them; and will thus <figure id="fig.00684">
<head orig="Roman Forum Restored.">Roman Forum Restored.</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="685" /><cb />
 afford a general notion of the usual appearance of these places, and of the manner in which they were laid out. The central area is paved with large square flags, on which the bases for many statues still remain, and surrounded by a Doric colonnade of two stories, backed by a range of spacious and lofty buildings all round. The principal entrance is through an archway (<seg lang="la">fornix</seg>) (<hi rend="SmallCaps">a</hi>), on the lower end of the annexed plan, and by the side of a temple of the Corinthian order (<hi rend="SmallCaps">b</hi>), supposed to have been dedicated to Iupiter. On the opposite flank of this temple is another entrance into the Forum, and by its side the public prison (<seg lang="la">carcer</seg>) (<hi rend="SmallCaps">c</hi>), in which the bones of two men with fetters on their legs were found. Adjacent to this is a long shallow building (<hi rend="SmallCaps">d</hi>), with several entrances from the colonnade, surmised by the Italian archaeologists to have been apublic granary (<seg lang="la">horreum</seg>). The next building is another temple of the Corinthian order (<hi rend="SmallCaps">e</hi>), dedicated to Apollo, as is learned from an inscription found on the spot. It stands in an area enclosed by a blank wall and peristyle, to which the principal entrance is in a side street, abutting on the Forum, and flanking the basilica (<hi rend="SmallCaps">f</hi>), beyond which there are three private houses out of the precincts of the Forum. The farther or southern side of the square is occupied by three public edifices (<hi rend="SmallCaps">g, h, i</hi>), nearly similar to one another in their plans and dimensions. All these were decorated with columns and statues, fragments of which were found upon the floor; but <figure id="fig.00685">

</figure> <cb /> <figure id="fig.00685.2">
<head orig="Plan of the Forum at Pompeii. (Rich.)">Restoration of the North Side of the Forum at Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>
</figure> there are no sufficient grounds for deciding the uses for which they were destined. The first is merely conjectured to have been a council chamber (<seg lang="la">curia</seg>); the second, the treasury (<seg lang="la">aerarium</seg>); and the last, another curia. Beyond these is another street, opening on the Forum; and, turning the angle, are the remains of a square building (<hi rend="SmallCaps">k</hi>), for which no satisfactory use can be suggested. The space behind is occupied by the sites of three private houses. The next object is a large plot of ground (<hi rend="SmallCaps">l</hi>), surrounded by a colonnade (<seg lang="la">porticus</seg>) and a cloister (<seg lang="la">crypta</seg>), and decorated 
<pb n="686" /><cb /> in front, where it faces the Forum, by a spacious entrance porch or vestibule (<hi rend="italic">chalcidicum</hi>), all of which were constructed at the expense of a woman named Eumachia. Beyond this is a small temple (<hi rend="SmallCaps">m</hi>) upon a raised basement, attributed by some to Mercury, by others to Quirinus; and adjoining it, an edifice (<hi rend="SmallCaps">n</hi>), with a large semicircular tribune or absis at its farther extremity, supposed to have been a meeting-hall for the Augustales, or a town-hall (<seg lang="la">senaculum</seg>) for the Pompeian Senate. The rear of both these structures is covered by the premises belonging to a fuller's establishment (<seg lang="la">fullonica</seg>). The last structure (<hi rend="SmallCaps">o</hi>) is a magnificent building, with various appurtenances behind it, commonly called the Pantheon, from twelve pedestals placed in a circle round an altar in their centre, supposed to have supported the statues of the Dii Magni, or twelve principal divinities.</p>

<head orig="Franci">Franci</head>

 <p> A confederation of Germanic tribes, which first appeared on the stage of history in the last quarter of the second century of our era. It <cb /> was formed in place of the earlier league of the <ref type="cross" target="crosscherusci">Cherusci</ref> (q.v.), and comprised the Sigambri, the Chamavi, Ampsivarii, Bructeri, Chatti, Salii, etc., along the Middle and Lower Rhine. As the Franks are first mentioned during the reign of Antoninus (A.D. 240), Mannert concludes that their confederation was not the result of aggression from Rome, but of internal wars; and these wars he conceives to have been chiefly of self-defence against the Saxon confederation, which, occupying the north of Germany, sought to extend itself westward to the Rhine. The Germans lying between the Saxons and that river found it necessary to unite in order to resist their northern invaders, and did so successfully under their new name of Franks. Various etymologies have been assigned to this appellation; but it probably comes from the German term <hi rend="italic">frank</hi>, meaning “free,” and indicating a race of freemen; and is the source of the name France, which first came into use in the ninth century A.D. The Franks soon became powerful enough to act on the offensive, and, crossing the Rhine to meet other foes, they spread their devastations from the banks of that river to the foot of the Pyrenees; nor were they stopped by these mountains. Spain, in turn, was overrun; and when the exhausted country no longer supplied a variety of plunder, the Franks seized on some vessels and transported themselves into Mauritania. They were afterwards driven out of Gaul by the Roman arms, and from the reign of Probus (A.D. 277) to that of Honorius seem to have contented themselves with occasional irruptions. They obtained a permanent footing in Gaul during the last years or the reign of Honorius. About the year 496, Clovis, or Chlodowig (his proper Teutonic name), by reducing the several Frankish principalities under his own sceptre and conquering the last remnant of the Western Roman Empire in Gaul, is held to have founded the French monarchy (481-511). His Frankish kingdom was, nevertheless, by no means commensurate with modern France, consisting merely of the northern German provinces on probably both banks of the Rhine, of the present kingdom of the Netherlands, and of so much of France as lies north of the Loire, with the exception of Brittany, where large bodies of Britons, expelled from their insular home by the Saxons, had established themselves and long maintained their independence. Of the southern half of France, the larger part, situated to the west of the Rhone, was included in the Visigothic kingdom of Spain; while the provinces to the east of that river were held, together with Savoy and Switzerland, by the Burgundians. Chlodowig attacked both. Against the Burgundians he effected little or nothing, but he was more successful against their western neighbours. Assisted by the hatred which the Catholic natives entertained towards their Arian master, he, before his death, reduced the Visigothic dominions in Gaul to the single province of Languedoc, incorporating all the rest in his Frankish realm. His sons and grandsons, in time, not only subdued Burgundy, but brought many German nations, as the Thuringians, Allemanni, and Bavarians, into complete feudal subjection. There were two great divisions of the Franks—the Salian Franks and the Ripuarian Franks—with separate laws, afterwards collected into two codes, the Lex Salica and the Lex Ripuariorum.

<div2 id="crossfratres-arvales" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Fratres Arvāles">Fratres Arvales</head>

 <p> The Arval Brethren; a Roman 
<pb n="687" /><cb /> <seg lang="la">collegium</seg> or company of priests, twelve in number, and so called, according to Varro (<title>L. L.</title> v. 85), from offering public sacrifices for the fertility of the fields (<seg lang="la">arva</seg>). Their extreme antiquity is proved by the legend which refers their institution to Romulus, of whom it is said that when his nurse Acca Larentia lost one of her twelve sons, he allowed himself to be adopted by her in his place, and called himself and the remaining eleven “Fratres Arvales” ( <bibl n="Gel.  6. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.vi. 7</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The office of the Fratres Arvales was for life, and was not taken away even from an exile or captive. They wore, as a badge of office, a chaplet of ears of corn (<seg lang="la">spicea corona</seg>) fastened on their heads with a white band (<seg lang="la">infula</seg>) ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18.  6" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 6</bibl>). These passages, with a single reference in Minucius Felix ( <bibl n="Sen.  Oct. 25" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oct.</title>25</bibl>), comprise all the extant notices of the Fratres Arvales in the ancient writers. But the discovery of a large number of inscriptions has placed the locality of their sanctuary beyond a doubt, and has thrown a flood of light on their constitution and ceremonial as well as on that of other Roman priesthoods. In the Vigna Ceccarelli, at a place called Affoga l'Asino, on the Via Portuensis, inscriptions upon stone tablets have been found at intervals from 1570 to the present time, which sufficiently identify that spot as the grove of the Dea Dia where the chief festival of the Arvales was held. By the end of the last century, sixty-seven documents had been recovered, and these were published with a valuable commentary by Marini <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1795)</bibl>. In 1867 more systematic excavations were undertaken with the aid of funds supplied by the King and Queen of Prussia, and the results were given to the world by Henzen in the works mentioned at the end of this article. We have now the <seg lang="la">acta</seg> of ninety-six annual meetings of the college, ranging in date from A.D. 14, the last year of Augustus, to 241, in the reign of Gordian; besides a number of fragments found at various times in Rome itself. From these we are able to form a clear idea of the officers of the college, the ceremonies they performed, and the mode of filling up vacancies in their body. Some of these minutes of proceedings, as they may be called, are much fuller than others, the most important being that of 218, the first year of Elagabalus, which includes the celebrated Hymn. The passage in Varro being the only mention of the Arvales that dates from republican times, it is a highly probable conjecture that this may have been one of the obsolete or half-forgotten cults, several of which, we know, were revived by Augustus. The <title>sacrificium Deae Diae in luco</title> is named in the law of Constantius and Constans, about 346, which, in the interest of the public amusement, provided for the maintenance of such temples as had games connected with them. In 382, by a decree of Gratian, the disestablishment of all pagan worships was completed, and their remaining endowments confiscated.</p>
 <p>The regular number of brethren was twelve; the attendance at the annual meetings, as shown by the inscriptions, varied between three and nine. An exception occurs early in the reign of Nero; in the year 57 twelve Fratres met, exclusive of the emperor, who was also a member according to the invariable practice, and in this instance, it would appear, a supernumerary. From the time of Augustus it had become usual to appoint princes of the imperial family as extra members of the most <cb /> dignified priestly colleges (Dio Cass. li. 20). Vacancies as they occurred were filled up by co-optation, originally free, but under the empire usually controlled by an imperial rescript indicating the person to be elected, like the <hi rend="italic">congé d'elire</hi> of modern times. For the purpose of an election the brethren met on the summons of the <seg lang="la">magister</seg> in the Regia, the temple of Iupiter Stator, that of Divus Iulius, or latterly in the temple of Concord; and the votes were given in writing (<seg lang="la">per tabellas</seg>). The newly elected member was solemnly admitted by the <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, for which the phrase used is <seg lang="la">ad sacra vocat.</seg></p>
 <p>Like most Roman <seg lang="la">collegia</seg>, the Arvales had their presiding officer, called <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, elected annually in the grove of the Dea Dia on the second or great day of the May festival, but not coming into office until the 17th of December following: <title>a Saturnalibus primis ad Saturnalia secunda</title> is the oft-recurring formula. The <seg lang="la">promagister</seg>, who acted in the absence of the <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, appears to have been nominated by him for an indefinite period, and was not a regularly elected officer of the college. Next in importance to the <seg lang="la">magister</seg> was the <seg lang="la">flamen</seg>, elected annually upon the same occasion to assist in the sacrifices; he could also be represented by a <seg lang="la">proflamen</seg>, or by a member without that title <seg lang="la">qui vice flaminis fungebatur.</seg> Either of these dignities was often conferred by way of compliment on the emperor, who usually discharged its duties by deputy, and either might be re-elected in consecutive years or after an interval. There were, besides, four <seg lang="la">pueri ingenui patrimi et matrimi, senatorum filii</seg> (called also <title>Camilli</title>), who waited on the brethren during the sacrificial feast, and shared it themselves sitting on <seg lang="la">cathedrae</seg>, while their elders reclined. The college had also its staff of servants; some <seg lang="la">servi publici</seg>, assigned to its use by the emperor and reckoned as belonging to his <seg lang="la">familia</seg>, an <seg lang="la">aedituus</seg> in charge of the sacred precinct, and lastly the <seg lang="la">calatores.</seg></p>
 <p>The principal duty of the Arvales was to celebrate a three days' festival in honour of the Dea Dia, supposed by Marini to be Ceres, but now identified with Ops. This festival was sometimes held on the XVI., XIV., and XIII., sometimes on the VI., IV., and III. Kal. Iun.—i. e. on the 17th, 19th, and 20th, or the 27th, 29th, and 30th of May; in either instance, it will be seen, with a bye-day between the first and second feast days, while the third immediately followed the second. The precise time was fixed in the January of each year, and solemnly proclaimed by the <seg lang="la">magister</seg> or his deputy from the temple of Concord on the Clivus Capitolinus. The festival undoubtedly belonged to the order of <seg lang="la">feriae conceptivae</seg>, or those fixed by proclamation. On the first and last of the three days the college met in Rome, usually at the house of the <seg lang="la">magister</seg>, but sometimes also <title>in Palatio in templo Divorum;</title> offered fruits, incense, and wine at sunrise to the Dea Dia; anointed her statue; bathed, and changed the <seg lang="la">praetexta</seg> in which they had sacrificed for a white dinner-dress (<seg lang="la">album cenatorium;</seg> cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosssynthesis">Synthesis</ref>). Between dinner and dessert (<seg lang="la">mensa prima</seg> and <seg lang="la">mensa secunda bellariorum</seg>) they rose from table, reclined on more magnificent couches than those of the <seg lang="la">triclinium (toralibus segmentatis)</seg>, repeated the offerings of wine, incense, and firstfruits (<seg lang="la">fruges libatae</seg>); then divided the <seg lang="la">bellaria</seg>, and received each man a <seg lang="la">sportula</seg> or perquisite for attendance. This, in the period from Trajan to 
<pb n="688" /><cb />
 the Antonines amounted to 100 denarii, the boys receiving 25; in the impoverished times of the third century it was reduced to 25 denarii for members of the college.</p>
 <p>On the second day of the feast, which was the most important of the three, the Arvales assembled in the grove of Dea Dia already described. The grove included a circus for games and several temples, among which the Caesareum or <seg lang="la">aedicula</seg> of deified emperors and the Tetrastylum are mentioned. The sacrifices were begun early in the day by the <seg lang="la">magister</seg> or his deputy, acting alone; he first offered two young pigs in order to expiate the unavoidable desecration of the sacred grove by the use of the axe in pruning and felling it, then a white heifer (<seg lang="la">vacca honoraria</seg>) as a victim to the Dea Dia herself. In the forenoon he was joined by his colleagues, who breakfasted on the offerings already made, and then proceeded to fresh ceremonies. They sacrificed a fat lamb; made an offering, not further described, with earthenware pots placed on a table; sent out two of their number to collect grains of corn, probably from the crowd collected at the temple doors, passed them on to one another, receiving them in the left hand and giving with the right, and finally handing them to the attendants; placed the <seg lang="la">ollae</seg> on the altar, and then threw them away that they might not be used again (this is the probable explanation of the obscure phrase <seg lang="la">ollas precati sunt et ostiis apertis per clivum iactaverunt</seg>); and shared <seg lang="la">panes laureati</seg>, followed by turnips and another vegetable mysteriously described (<seg lang="la">lumemulia cum rapinis</seg>). The images were now anointed (the plural <seg lang="la">deas</seg> is used here only, and seems to refer to Acca Larentia and the Dea Dia as separate divinities); the temple was cleared of all but the priests, and the doors shut. Then with their tunics girded up for the dance, taking written copies of the formula from their attendants, and dividing right and left into two bodies, they proceeded to recite the hymn which had made the name of Fratres Arvales so interesting (<seg lang="la">ibi sacerdotes clusi succincti, libellis acceptis, carmen descindentes tripodaverunt in verba haec</seg>).</p>
 <p>The text here given is that of Mommsen ( <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 1. 231" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>i. 231</bibl>, Eng. trans.), with which those of Preller (<title>Röm. Myth.</title> p. 428) and Marquardt, after Bücheler (<bibl default="NO"><title>Index Schol. Bonnens. Aest.</title> 1876</bibl>), agree in the main. A rude Saturnian metre is discernible in the hymn: <lb />Enos, Lases, iuvate, <lb />Neve lue rue, Marmar, sins incurrere in pleores. <lb />Satur fu, fere Mars! limen sali! sta! berber! <lb />Semunis alternei advocapit conctos. <lb />Enos Marmar iuvato. <lb />Triumpe.</p>
 <p>In Mommsen's rendering:</p>
 <p>To the gods— <lb />Nos, Lares, iuvate, <lb /> (<title>Aid us, ye Lares</title>), <lb />Neve luem ruem (=ruinam) sinas incurrere in plures. <lb /> (<title>Nor suffer pestilence and destruction to come upon the people</title>). <lb />Satur esto, fere Mars. <lb /> (<title>Be thou satiate, fierce Mars</title>).</p>
 <p>To the individual brethren— <lb />In limen insili! sta! verbera! <lb /> (<title>Leap o'er the threshold! Halt! Beat</title> [the ground]).</p>
 <p>To all the brethren— <lb />Semones alterni advocate cunctos. <lb /> (<title>Call alternately the heroes all</title>).</p>
 <p>To the god— <lb />Nos, Mamers, iuvato! <lb /> (<title>Aid us, Mars</title>).</p>
 <p>To the individual brethren— <lb />Triumpe. <lb /> (<title>Hurrah!</title>) <cb /></p>
 <p>Each of the first five lines was repeated thrice, <seg lang="la">triumpe</seg> five times in the inscription, but probably six were intended. There are other indications of mistakes on the part of the stonecutter. Comments on the text, etc., will be found in Marini, <bibl default="NO"><title>Atti e Monumenti dei Fratelli Arvali</title> (Rome, 1795)</bibl>; Henzen, <bibl default="NO"><title>Scavi vel Bosco Sacro dei Fratelli Arvali</title> (Rome, 1868)</bibl>; id. <bibl default="NO"><title>Acta Fratrum Arvalium</title> (Berlin, 1874)</bibl>; the <title>Corp.

 <p>After the recitation the doors were thrown open and the service-books handed back to the attendants; and the brethren now proceeded to the election of a Magister and a Flamen for the ensuing year, followed by the distribution of the <seg lang="la">sportula</seg> and of roses. Next came races in the circus of the grove, in which <seg lang="la">bigae, quadrigae</seg>, and <seg lang="la">desultores</seg> are mentioned: the Magister or his deputy presided at the games, habited in the <seg lang="la">ricinium</seg> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossricinium">Ricinium</ref>), and gave away the prizes. The brethren then returned to Rome and dined together, usually in the house of the Magister.</p>
 <p>Of the other functions of the Fratres Arvales a short account will be sufficient. Whenever iron was brought into the grove, as for cutting the inscriptions for the <seg lang="la">acta</seg>, or the lopping and felling of the trees (already mentioned), there were sacrifices <seg lang="la">ob ferrum illatum</seg>, and, when the work was done, <seg lang="la">ob ferrum elatum.</seg> When the trees fell from decay or, worse still, were struck by lightning, and when replanting was undertaken, still more solemn sacrifices (<seg lang="la">suovetaurilia maiora</seg>) were offered on the spot. The Arvales also met for the <seg lang="la">nuncupatio</seg> or solemn pronouncing of vows for important events in the imperial family—the birthday, marriage, illness or recovery of the emperor, his setting out for or returning from serious undertakings, the confinement of an empress, etc. The <ref type="cross" target="crossambarvalia">Ambarvalia</ref> (q.v.), according to the most probable opinion, were entirely separate from the functions of the Fratres Arvales.

He was the author of two treatises that are still extant —one on the art of war and another on the Roman aqueducts. He was nominated Curator Aquarum, or Superintendent of the Aqueducts, in 97, and died in 106. His military treatise is in three books (<title>Strategematon Libri Tres</title>), and was published as a supplement to another work now lost, which related to the theory of war.

<div2 id="crossfronto" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Fronto</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">M. Cornelius</foreName>
 <p>(1) A Latin writer, born at Cirta, in Africa, of an Italian family, about A.D. 100. After studying in his own country, he came to Rome in the reign of Hadrian, and acquired great reputation as a rhetorician and grammarian. Antoninus Pius appointed him preceptor to his two <cb /> adopted sons, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, whose confidence and affection he gained, as is proved by their letters. After being consul (A.D. 143), Fronto was appointed to a government in Asia, which his bad health prevented him from filling. His learning and conversation are mentioned with praise by Aulus Gellius, the historian Appian, and others of his contemporaries. He died in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, at an advanced age. Until this century we had nothing of Fronto's works, except fragments of his treatise <title>De Differentia Verborum</title>, being a vocabulary of the socalled synonyms; but in 1815, Angelo Mai, having discovered in the Ambrosian Library at Milan a palimpsest MS., on which had been originally written some letters of Fronto to his two pupils, deciphered the text wherever the writing was not entirely obliterated, and published it with notes. It happened, by singular good fortune, that Mai, being some years after appointed librarian of the Vatican, discovered in another palimpsest volume another part of Fronto's letters, with the answers of Marcus Aurelius and Verus. Both the volumes came originally from the monastery of St. Columbanus, at Bobbio, the monks having written them over with the Acts of the First Council of Chalcedon, and it had happened that one of the volumes was transferred to Milan and the other to Rome. Mai published the whole in a new edition <bibl default="NO">(Rome, 1823 and 1846)</bibl>. The MSS. have been subsequently collated by Du Rieu <bibl default="NO">(revision by Naber, Leipzig, 1867)</bibl>. These letters are very valuable, as throwing additional light on the age of the Antonines, confirming what we know of the excellent character of Marcus Aurelius, and also showing his colleague Verus in a more favourable light than he had been viewed before. Two or three short epistles of Antoninus Pius are also interesting. There are, besides, many letters of Fronto to various friends, some of which are in Greek. Fronto's style is excessively mannered, monotonous, and pedantic; he mixes Latin and Greek in a macaronic fashion; and shows himself to be a conceited prig. He was, however, an admirer of the early Roman literature and a man of upright and independent character. See Droz, <bibl default="NO"><title>De M. Corn. Frontonis Institutione Oratoria</title> (Besançon, 1885)</bibl>; and on the diction, the treatise of Priebe <bibl default="NO">(Stettin, 1885)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(2) A native of Emesa, a rhetorician, who lived at Rome in the time of Alexander Severus. He taught eloquence also at Athens, and was the rival of the first Philostratus. The critic Longinus was his nephew. He has left two epigrams on points of grammar (Jacobs, <title>Anth. Graec.</title> iii. 56; xiii. 398).

 <p> From the earliest times the supply of corn at Rome was considered one of the duties of the government. Not only was it expected that the government should take care that the corn-market (<seg lang="la">annona</seg>) was properly supplied, but likewise that in all seasons of scarcity it should purchase corn in the surrounding countries and sell it to the people at a moderate price (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 9</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  34" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 34</bibl>; iv. 12<bibl n="Liv.  52" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 52</bibl>; x. 11, etc.; xxvi. 40). This price, which is spoken of as <seg lang="la">annona vetus</seg>, could not rise much without exciting formidable discontent; and the administration was in all such cases considered to have neglected one 
<pb n="690" /><cb />
 of its most important duties. The superintendence of the corn-market belonged in ordinary times to the aediles; but when great scarcity prevailed, an extraordinary officer was appointed for the purpose, under the title of Praefectus Annonae (<bibl n="Liv.  2. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ii. 27</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  5" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 5</bibl>; iv. 12<bibl n="Liv.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>With the decay of agriculture in Italy, the government had to pay still further attention to the supply of corn for the city. In addition to this, an indigent population gradually increased in Rome, which could not purchase corn even at the moderate price at which it was usually sold, and who demanded to be fed at the expense of the State. Even in early times it had been usual for the State on certain occasions, and for wealthy individuals who wished to obtain popularity and influence, to make occasional donations of corn to the people (Mommsen, <title>Rom. Hist.</title> ii. 372). But such donations were only casual; and it was not till the year B.C. 123 that the first legal provision was made for supplying the poor at Rome with corn at a price much below its market value. In that year, C. Sempronius Gracchus brought forward the first <seg lang="la">lex frumentaria</seg>, by which each citizen was entitled to receive every month a certain quantity of wheat (<seg lang="la">triticum</seg>) at the price of 6 1/3 asses (about $0.06) for the modius, which was equal to nearly 1 peck English (cf. Mommsen, <title>Die römischen Tribus</title>, p. 179, n. 4, and p. 182, n. 18; Livy , <bibl n="Flor. Epit. 60" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Epit.</title>60</bibl>; Appian, <title>B. C.</title> i. 21) — only a trifle more than half the market price. It must not be supposed that each person was allowed to receive as much as he pleased every month; the quantity must of course have been fixed, and was probably five modii monthly, as in later times. This quantity was given only to fathers of families; but it was not confined to the poor, for every citizen had a right to it, whether he were rich or poor (<seg lang="la">viritim</seg>, <title>Tusc. Disp.</title> iii. 20, 48); and even Piso, who had been consul, applied for his share at the distribution ( <bibl n="Cic.  1." default="NO">Cic.1.</bibl> c.). It appears, however, from the anecdote which Cicero relates about Piso, that each citizen had to apply in person, a regulation which would of itself deter most of the rich. The example that had been set by Gracchus was too tempting not to be followed, although it emptied the treasury and at the same time taught the poor to become State-paupers instead of depending upon their own exertions for obtaining a living. It thus crowded the city with an idle population.</p>
 <p>The demagogue Apuleius Saturninus went still further. In B.C. 100 he brought forward his Lex Apuleia, by which the State was to sell corn at 5/6 of an <hi rend="italic">as</hi> for the modius. The city quaestor Q. Caepio pointed out that the treasury could not bear such an expense (cf. Mommsen, <title>Gesch. d. röm. Münzwesen</title>, p. 560), and the most violent opposition was offered to the measure. It is doubtful whether it ever passed into a law; and it is at all events certain that it was never carried into execution. The Lex Livia, which was proposed by the tribune M. Livius Drusus in B.C. 91, was likewise never carried into effect, as it was annulled by the Senate, together with all his other laws, as passed in opposition to the auspices. Of the provisions of this Lex Frumentaria we have no account (Livy ,  <title>Epit.</title>lxxi.). About the same time, either shortly before or shortly after the Lex Livia, the tribune M. Octavius, supported by the aristocracy, brought forward the Lex Octavia, <cb /> which modified the law of Gracchus to some extent, so that the public treasury did not suffer so much. He probably either raised the price of the corn, or diminished the number of modii which each citizen was entitled to receive ( <bibl n="Cic. Brut. 62" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Brut.</title>62</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Brut. 222" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Brut., 222</bibl>). Sulla went still further, and by his Lex Cornelia, B.C. 82, did away altogether with these distributions of corn (Sall. <title>Hist. Fragm.</title> i. 45, 11, Kritz). But the Senate soon found it inexpedient to deprive the people of their customary largesses, as the popular party began to increase in power; and it was accordingly at the desire of the Senate that the consuls in B.C. 73 brought forward the Lex Terentia Cassia, which was probably only a renewal of the Lex Sempronia, with one or two additions respecting the manner in which the State was to obtain the corn. The law enacted that each Roman citizen should receive 5 modii a month at the price of 6 1/3 asses for each modius. Occasionally extraordinary distributions of corn were made in virtue of decrees of the Senate.</p>
 <p>All the <seg lang="la">leges frumentariae</seg> that have been hitherto mentioned had sold corn to the people, although at a price much below what the State had paid for it; but as the great party-leaders towards the close of the Republic were ready to purchase the support of the people at any sacrifice to the State, the distribution of corn became at length quite gratuitous. Caesar, in his consulship, B.C. 59, had threatened to make it so ( <title>Ad Att.</title> ii. 19); and this threat was carried into execution in the following year, B.C. 58, by the Lex Clodia of the tribune Clodius. The corn was thus in future distributed without any payment; and the abolition of the payment cost the State a fifth part of its revenues ( <title>Pro Sest.</title> 25, 55, with Schol. Bob. p. 301, ed. Orelli). In B.C. 57, Pompey received by the Lex Cornelia Caecilia the superintendence of the corn-market (<seg lang="la">cura annonae</seg>) for a period of five years; but no alteration was made in the distribution of corn by virtue of this measure. At this time the distribution of corn must have cost the State nearly $3,500,000 a year.</p>
 <p>The consequences of such a system did not escape the penetration of Caesar; and accordingly, when master of the Roman world, he resolved to remedy the evils attending it, as far as he was able. He did not venture to abolish altogether these distributions of corn, but he did the next best thing in his power, which was the reduction of the number of recipients. During the Civil Wars numbers of persons who had no claim to the Roman franchise had settled at Rome, in order to obtain a share in the distributions of corn. The first thing, therefore, that Caesar did was to have an accurate list made out of all the corn-receivers, and to exclude from this privilege every person who could not prove that he was a Roman citizen. By this measure the 320,000 persons who had previously received the corn were at once reduced to 150,000. Having thus lessened the number of corn-receivers, he enacted that this number should not be exceeded for the future, and that vacancies which occurred by death should be filled up every year by lot by the praetor urbanus ( <bibl n="Jul. Caes. 55" default="NO"> <title>Caes.</title>55</bibl>; Dio Cass. xliii. 21). It is further exceedingly probable that, as a general rule, the corn was not <hi rend="italic">given</hi> even to these 150,000, but sold at a low price, as had been the case at an earlier period; and that it was only to the utterly destitute that the corn was supplied gratuitously; the latter 
<pb n="691" /><cb /> class of persons were furnished with tickets, called <seg lang="la">tesserae nummariae</seg> or <seg lang="la">frumentariae</seg> ( <title>Octav.</title> 41).</p>
 <p>The useful regulations of Caesar fell into neglect after his death, and the number of corn-receivers was soon increased beyond the limits of 150,000, which had been fixed by the dictator. This we learn from the Monumentum Ancyranum, in which Augustus ( 15) enumerates the number of persons to whom he had given congiaria at different times; and there can be no doubt that the receivers of the congiaria and of the public corn were the same. Thus, in B.C. 44, and on the three following occasions, he distributed the congiaria to 250,000 persons; and in B.C. 5 the number of recipients had amounted to 320,000. At length, in B.C. 2, Augustus reduced the number of recipients to 200,000, and renewed many of Caesar's regulations ( <title>Octav.</title> 40; Dio Cass. lv. 10). The chief regulations of Augustus seem to have been: (1) That every citizen should receive monthly a certain quantity of corn (probably 5 modii) on the payment of a certain small sum. As the number of recipients was fixed by Augustus at 200,000, there were consequently 12,000,000 modii distributed every year. Occasionally, in seasons of scarcity, or in order to confer a particular favour, Augustus made these distributions wholly gratuitous; they then became congiaria.</p>
 <p>(2) That those who were completely indigent should receive the corn gratuitously, as Iulius Caesar had determined, and should be furnished for the purpose with <seg lang="la">tesserae nummariae</seg> or <seg lang="la">frumentariae</seg>, which entitled them to the corn without payment ( <title>Octav.</title> 41).</p>
 <p>The system which had been established by Augustus was followed by his successors; but as it was always one of the first maxims of the State policy of the Roman emperors to prevent any disturbance in the capital, they frequently lowered the price of the public corn, and frequently distributed it gratuitously as a congiarium. Hence the cry of the populace, <seg lang="la">panem et circenses.</seg> No emperor ventured to abolish the public distributions of corn; the most that he dared do was to raise the price at which it was sold. When, therefore, we find it stated in Dio Cassius (lxii. 18) that Nero did away with the distributions of corn after the burning of Rome, we cannot understand this literally, but must suppose that he either raised the price of the commodity, or, what is more probable, obliged those poor to pay for it who had previously rereceived it gratuitously. The care which the emperors took to keep Rome well supplied with corn is frequently referred to in their coins by the legends, <title>Annona, Ubertas, Abundantia, Liberalitas</title>, etc. We find in a coin of Nerva the legend <seg lang="la">plebei urbanae frumento constituto</seg> (Eckhel, vol. vi. p. 406).</p>
 <p>In course of time, the sale of the corn by the State seems to have ceased altogether, and the distribution became altogether gratuitous. Every corn-receiver was therefore now provided with a <seg lang="la">tessera</seg>, or ticket, and this tessera, when once granted to him, became his property. Hence it came to pass that he was not only allowed to keep the tessera for life, but even to dispose of it by sale, and bequeath it by will (<title>Dig.</title> v. 1, 52; xxxix. 1, 49; xxxix. 1, 87). Every citizen living in Rome, even freedmen and criminals ( <title>De Benef.</title> iv. 28, 2), was competent to hold a tessera, with the exception of senators. <cb /></p>
 <p>Another change was also introduced at a later period, which rendered the bounty still more ac<figure id="fig.00691">
<head orig="Tesserae Frumentariae. (Rich.)">Tesserae Frumentariae. (Rich.)</head>
</figure> ceptable to the people. Instead of distributing the corn every month, wheaten bread, called <seg lang="la">annona civica</seg>, was given to the people. It is uncertain at what time this change was introduced, but it seems to have been the custom before the reign of Aurelian (A.D. 270-275), as it is related of this emperor that on his return from his eastern expedition he distributed among the people a larger quantity of bread, and of a different form from that which had been usually given (Vopisc. <title>Aurel.</title> 35; Zosim. i. 61). The bread was baked by the <seg lang="la">pistores</seg>, who delivered it to the various depots in the city, from which it was carried away on certain days by the holders of the tesserae (Orelli, <title>Inscript.</title> no. 3358). These depots had steps (<seg lang="la">gradus</seg>) leading to them, whence the bread was called <seg lang="la">panis gradilis;</seg> and there were the strictest regulations that the bread should only be distributed from these steps, and should never be obtained at the baker's (Cod. Theod. xiv. 17, 3, 4). When Constantine transferred the seat of government to Constantinople, the system of gratuitous distribution of bread was also transferred to that city; and in order to encourage the building of houses, all householders were entitled to a share of the imperial bounty (Zosim. iii. 32). The distribution of bread at Rome was, however, still continued.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">φῦκος</foreign>). A general term to signify the cosmetic which the Greek and Roman ladies employed in painting their cheeks, eyebrows, and other parts of their faces. The practice of painting the face was very general among the Greek ladies, and probably came into fashion in consequence of their sedentary mode of life, which robbed their complexions of their natural freshness, and induced them to have recourse to artificial means for restoring the red and white of nature ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 10. 10" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>10. 10</bibl>). The practice was of great antiquity, 
<pb n="692" /><cb /> and was probably first introduced among the Asiatic Ionians from the East, where the custom has prevailed from the earliest times. The resemblance between the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">pūch</hi>, “paint,” and <foreign lang="greek">φῦκος</foreign>, is probably not accidental; the connection is accepted by Muss-Arnolt, the original meaning of both words being sea-weed, from which an alkaline dye was prepared.</p>
 <p>The ladies at Athens did not always paint their faces when at home, but only when they went abroad, or wished to appear beautiful or captivating. Of this we have an example in the speech of Lysias on the murder of Eratosthenes, in which <figure id="fig.00692">
<head orig="Woman Painting her Face (Tischbein).">Woman Painting her Face (Tischbein).</head>
</figure> it is related ( 17) that the wife, on leaving her husband to visit her paramour, painted herself (cf.  <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 149" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Lys.</title>149</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristoph. Eccl. 878" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eccl.</title>878</bibl>, <title>Plut.</title> 1064; <title>Alcib.</title> 39). In order to produce a fair complexion, white lead (<foreign lang="greek">ψιμύθιον</foreign>, <seg lang="la">cerussa</seg>) was employed (Alexis, fr. 96, 17 M). In order to give a blooming tinge to the cheeks, “rouge” was prepared from vegetable reds ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Lys.</title>48</bibl>). Ancient cosmetics were not always free from noxious drugs; and besides <foreign lang="greek">ψιμύθιον</foreign>, already mentioned, red lead (<foreign lang="greek">μιλτός</foreign>, <seg lang="la">minium</seg>) and mineral alkali (<foreign lang="greek">νίτρον</foreign>, Att. <foreign lang="greek">λίτρον</foreign>) were employed. The usual word for applying paint is <foreign lang="greek">ἐντρίβεσθαι</foreign>, “to rub in,” whence the dyes themselves are called <foreign lang="greek">ἐντρίμματα</foreign> ( <bibl n="Plut. Crass. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Crass.</title>24</bibl>). The eye-brows and eyelids were stained black with <foreign lang="greek">στίμμα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">στίμμις</foreign>, <seg lang="la">stibium</seg>, a sulphuret of antimony, which is still employed by the Turkish ladies for the same purpose. The eye-brows were likewise stained with <foreign lang="greek">ἄσβολος</foreign>, a preparation of soot (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  2. 93" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.ii. 93</bibl> foll.). Ladies who used paint were occasionally betrayed by perspiration, tears, etc., of which a humorous picture is given by Xenophon ( <bibl n="Cic. Oecon. 10. 8" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Oecon.</title>10. 8</bibl>; cf. Plaut. <title>Most.</title> i. 3, 119).</p>
 <p>Among the Romans the art of painting the complexion was carried to a still greater extent than among the Greeks; and even Ovid did not disdain to write a poem on the subject (<title>A .A.</title> iii. 206), though the genuineness of the fragment of the <title>Medicamina Faciei</title>, ascribed to this poet, is doubtful. The Roman ladies even went so far as to paint with blue the veins on the temple, as has been inferred from Propertius (iii. 11, 9, L. Müller). The favourite rouge was from a kind of moss; another was <seg lang="la">purpurissum</seg>, a mixed composition (Plaut. <title>Most.</title> i. 3, 104). The ridiculous use of patches (<seg lang="la">splenia</seg>), which was common among the English ladies in the reign of Queen Anne and the early Georges, was not unknown to the Roman ladies ( <bibl n="Mart.  2. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.ii. 29</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 9</bibl>; viii. 33<bibl n="Mart.  22" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 22</bibl>; x. 22). The more effeminate of the male sex at Rome also employed paint. Cicero speaks (<title>In Pison.</title> 11. 25) of the <seg lang="la">cerussatae buccae</seg> of his enemy, the consul Piso.</p>
 <p>On a Greek vase (Tischbein, <title>Engravings</title>, ii. 58) we see the figure of a woman engaged in putting the paint upon her face with a small brush (cf. Böttiger, <title>Sabina</title>, i. 24 foll., 51 foll.; BeckerGöll, <title>Charikles</title>, i. 261 foll.; <title>Gallus</title>, iii. 164 foll.).

<head orig="Mural Painting from the Fullonica, Pompeii. (Overbeck.)">Mural Painting from the Fullonica, Pompeii. (Overbeck.)</head>

</figure> urine, nitre, and fuller's earth. Soap was not known before the time of Pliny , who speaks of <seg lang="la">sapo</seg> (q. v.) as a Gallic invention ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 28.  191" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>H. N.</title>xxviii. 191</bibl>). If the object was to felt the web and make it thicker and stronger, the same process was gone through, and the cloth was then beaten with rods, washed out in clean water, dried, carded with a kind of thistle or with the skin of a hedgehog, fumigated with sulphur, rubbed in with fuller's earth to make it whiter and stronger, and finally dressed by brushing, shearing, and pressing. The fuller's earth, when well rubbed in, prevented the clothes from becoming soiled too soon, and freshened up the colours which the sulphur had destroyed. Some frescoes preserved on the walls of an ancient fuller's shop at Pompeii give a clear notion of the different processes. The <seg lang="la">fullones</seg> at Rome formed one of the oldest guilds. Like all mechanics, they worshipped Minerva as their tutelary goddess, and took a prominent part in her chief festival, the Quinquatrus.

 <p> (1) A woman of good family, but loose character. She disclosed to Cicero the details of the conspiracy of Catiline, which she had learned from Quintus Curius, whose mistress she was (Sall. <bibl n="Sal. Cat. 23" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Cat.</title>23</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) A bold, ambitious woman, at first the wife of Clodius <ref type="cross" target="crosspulcher">Pulcher</ref> (q.v.), the demagogue, and, after his death, of Marcus Antonius the triumvir. She first came into notice on the assassination of Clodius, when, having caused the corpse to be brought into the vestibule of her dwelling and having assembled the populace, she caused, by her tears and language, a violent outbreak. Some years after this, on having become the wife of Antony, she took an active part in the proscriptions of her husband, and is said to have even sacrificed to her own vengeance several individuals who had given her offence. After the head of Cicero was brought to Antony, she took it on her knees, broke forth into insults to the character of the dead orator, and then, with fiendish malice, pierced the tongue with a golden needle. Having been left at Rome by Antony during the war against Brutus and Cassius, she became all-powerful in that city, named the praetors at her own pleasure, sold the government of the provinces, and even decreed a triumph to Lucius, the brother of Antony, who had no claim whatever to one. When, after the battle of Philippi, Antony visited the East to regulate affairs in that quarter, Fulvia, irritated by his intercourse with Cleopatra , tried to induce Octavianus to take up arms against him. Not succeeding in <cb /> this, she took them up against Octavianus himself, in conjunction with her brother-in-law Lucius, who now professed open opposition to the illegal power of the Triumvirate. After very bold and spirited efforts, however, on her part, she was besieged with her brother-in-law at Perusia and compelled to surrender to the power of Octavianus. Fulvia, after this, retired to Greece, and rejoined her husband, but was coldly received by him. She died at Sicyon, in B.C. 40, through chagrin and wounded pride, as was believed, at her husband's attachment to Cleopatra (Vell. Paterc. ii. 74; <title>Ant.;</title> id. <title>Cic.</title>).

Having obtained the consulship, in B.C. 189, he was intrusted with the war in Greece, during which he took Ambracia, traversed Epirus as conqueror, and reduced to submission the island of Cephallenia. Two years after this he was accused before the Senate of having maltreated the allies of the Roman people, but was acquitted of the charge, and received the honour of a triumph. In the year 179 he was elected censor along with Aemilius Lepidus, his bitter foe. Apprehending injury to the State from their known enmity, the leaders of the Senate adjured both individuals to lay aside their differences for the good of their country. A reconciliation accordingly took place, and nothing occurred to disturb these friendly feelings during the rest of their joint magistracy. Fulvius raised many public structures, a basilica, a forum, etc. He also constructed a port at the mouth of the Tiber (<bibl n="Liv.  33. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiii. 42</bibl>; xxxv. 7; xx. 22, etc.).

The next year he built a temple to Fortune, and, to adorn it, carried off a large portion of the marble tiles from the Temple of the Lacinian Juno in Lower Italy. The Senate compelled him to restore these. The popular account made him to have been deprived of reason for this act of sacrilege, as he committed suicide soon after (<bibl n="Liv.  39. 56" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxix. 56</bibl><bibl n="Liv.  40" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 40</bibl>; xl. 16; Vell.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">σχοινοβάτης</foreign>). A rope-dancer.

 <p> A funeral, so termed because, in ancient times, the Romans were buried by torch light, twisted ropes (<seg lang="la">funalia</seg>) smeared with pitch being carried by the mourners for the purpose (Isidor. <bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 11. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Orig.</title>xi. 2</bibl><bibl n="Isid.  Orig. 34" default="NO" valid="yes"> Orig., 34</bibl>; <seg lang="la">Donat. ad</seg> Terent. <bibl n="Eur.

Under this title, it is here intended to give an account of the burial rites of the Greeks and Romans. The tombs will be explained in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. The Greeks attached great importance to the burial of the dead. They believed that souls could not enter the Elysian Fields till their bodies had been buried; and accordingly we find the shade of Elpenor in the <title>Odyssey</title> (xi. 66, etc.) earnestly imploring Odysseus to bury his body. So strong was this feeling among the Greeks that it was considered a religious duty to throw earth upon a dead body which a person might happen to find unburied ( <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>i. 28</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 36" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 36</bibl>); and among the Athenians, those children who were released from all other obligations to unworthy parents were nevertheless bound to bury them ( <title>c. Timarch.</title> 14). The neglect of burying one's relatives is frequently mentioned by the orators as a grave charge against the moral character of a man, since the burial of the body by the relations of the dead was considered a religious duty by the universal law of the Greeks. The common expressions for the funeral rites, <foreign lang="greek">τὰ δίκαια, νόμιμα</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">νομιζόμενα, προσήκοντα</foreign>, show that the dead had, as it were, a legal and moral claim to burial.</p>
 <p>At the moment of death the eyes and mouth were closed by one of those present ( <bibl n="Sen. Phaed. 118" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phaed.</title>118</bibl>). According to Lucian, the obolus to serve as Charon 's fare was at once placed in the mouth of the corpse. This coin was also called <foreign lang="greek">δανάκη</foreign> (Hesych. s. v.). The custom is first mentioned by Aristophanes (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 139" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Frogs</title>, 139</bibl>), and does not appear to have been in use at a very early date. Confirmation of the practice is given by actual discoveries, for coins are frequently found in Greek tombs, and in some between the teeth of the skeleton. The body was then washed (Eurip. <bibl n="Sen. Phoen. 1319" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phoen.</title>1319</bibl><bibl n="Sen. Phoen. 1667" default="NO" valid="yes"> Phoen., 1667</bibl>), anointed with perfumes, and clothed in rich garments, generally white in colour. These were buried or burned with the body, but the number of them was limited by a law of Solon ( <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>21</bibl>). A wreath of flowers was placed upon the head (Eurip. <bibl n="Sen. Phoen. 1632" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Phoen.</title>1632</bibl>). Golden wreaths, in imitation of laurel or other foliage, were sometimes used, and have been found in graves.</p>
 <p>The corpse, thus prepared, was laid out (<foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις, προτίθεσθαι</foreign>) on a bed (<foreign lang="greek">κλίνη</foreign>), which appears to have been of the ordinary kind, with a pillow (<foreign lang="greek">προσκεφάλαιον</foreign>) for supporting the head and back <cb /> ( <title>c. Eratosth.</title> 18). By a law of Solon it was ordered that the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> should take place inside the house (Lex <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Demosth. <title>c. Macart.</title> p. 1071. 62). As among the Romans, the feet were turned towards the door ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 19. 212" default="NO" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title>xix. 212</bibl>). Vases of a special kind (<foreign lang="greek">λήκυθοι</foreign>), probably containing perfumes, were placed beside the body ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Eccl. 1032" default="NO" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Eccl.</title>1032</bibl><bibl n="Aristoph. Eccl. 538" default="NO" valid="yes">Ar. Eccl., 538</bibl>). These vases were also buried with the coffin, and a large number of them have been found in graves in Attica. A few of them are in the ordinary black and red figured styles, but the greater number are of a special ware of great beauty, manufactured for funeral purposes. In this ware the ground is white, and scenes are painted upon it in bright colours, in a freer and less rigid style than in the vases with red or black figures. See E. Pottier, <bibl default="NO"><title>Étude sur les Lécythes Blancs Attiques, à Représentations Funéraires</title> (Paris, 1883)</bibl>; Benndorf, <bibl default="NO"><title>Griechische und sicilische Vasenbilder</title> (Berlin, 1869)</bibl>; and the article <ref type="cross" target="crossvas">Vas</ref>. A honey-cake (<foreign lang="greek">μελιτοῦττα</foreign>), intended as a sop for Cerberus, was also placed by the side of the corpse ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 601" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Lys.</title>601</bibl>). Before the door, a vessel of water was placed (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρδάνιον</foreign>), in order that persons who had been in the house might purify themselves from the pollution of death by sprinkling water on their persons (Eurip. <bibl n="Nep. Alc. 98" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Alc.</title>98</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The near relatives of the deceased assembled round the bed on which he was laid, and uttered loud lamentations. Although more violent signs of grief were forbidden by Solon ( <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title>21</bibl>), we find that Lucian (<title>De Luctu</title>, 12) mentions as accompaniments of the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, not only groaning and wailing, but also beating of breasts, tearing of hair, laceration of cheeks, rending of garments, and sprinkling of ashes upon the head. It was perhaps with the object of limiting the time for these excesses of grief that Solon ordained that the burial should take place on the day after the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, before sunrise, and that Plato (<title>Leges</title>, xii. 959 A) declared that the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> should not last longer than was necessary to show that death had really taken place. It appears that singers were hired to lead the mourning chant at the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> (Lucian, <title>De Luctu</title>, 20).</p>
 <p>The accompanying illustration, representing the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>, is taken from Pottier. The corpse lies upon a couch, and is covered with a rich garment. The head alone is unveiled, and is surrounded with a fillet (<foreign lang="greek">ταινία</foreign>). Two female figures stand beside the couch, with gestures of grief. One of them carries a tray or basket, across which two fillets are laid. Other fillets are placed across the couch. In the background is a mirror, or fan, perhaps intended for the keeping away of flies (cf. Dio Cass. lxxiv. 4, 2). 
<pb n="696" /><cb /> </p>
 <p>The funeral (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκφορά, ἐκφέρειν</foreign>) took place legally, as has been already remarked, on the day following the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>. It might, however, be put off several days to allow of the arrival of distant friends ( <bibl n="Nep. Timol. 39" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Timol.</title>39</bibl>). The early morning was the usual time ( <title>Leges</title>, xii. 960 A). The bier was borne either by hired bearers (<foreign lang="greek">νεκροφόροι</foreign>, <bibl n="Poll.  7. 195" default="NO">Poll.vii. 195</bibl>), or, in cases where it was decided to honour the dead, by specially selected citizens ( <bibl n="Nep. Timol. 39" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Timol.</title>39</bibl>). The men walked before the corpse and the women behind, and it appears that musicians were hired to play mournful tunes on the flute and sing dirges (<foreign lang="greek">θρῆνοι</foreign>) at the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκφορά</foreign> as well as at the <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign>. Those who accompanied the funeral wore mourning garments of a black or dark colour (Eurip. <bibl n="Nep. Alc. 427" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Alc.</title>427</bibl>). The head was also shaved or the hair cut as a sign of grief ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 197" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>iv. 197</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23. 46" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiii. 46</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Il. 135" default="NO" valid="yes"> Il., 135</bibl><bibl n="Hom.

Idyll. 1. 81" default="NO"> <title>Idyll.</title>i. 81</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Representations of the <foreign lang="greek">ἐκφορά</foreign> are rare. The foregoing illustration represents a stamped terracotta plaque found at the Piraeus (in the collection of M. Rayet, <title>Convoi Funèbre</title>, No. 75). The corpse lies upon a couch. The head is bare; the rest of the body covered. The couch is placed upon a car drawn by two horses, though mules were oftener used. Mourners accompany it with gestures of grief. A female attendant carries upon her head a vessel, probably to serve for libations. Another attendant plays upon the double flute.</p>
 <p>It was the custom, at Athens at any rate, to hold public funerals for those who had fallen in war. Thucydides (ii. 34) describes with some minuteness the proceedings usual on such occasions. The <foreign lang="greek">πρόθεσις</foreign> of the bones took place on a platform (or perhaps in a booth or tent) erected for the purpose in some public place. On the day of the funerals, coffins of cypress wood, one for each tribe, were carried upon wagons. Each coffin contained the bones of the members of the tribe to which it was assigned. An empty couch, adorned as for a funeral, was borne in the procession to represent those whose bodies had not been found. The procession was accompanied by any citizens and aliens who wished to attend, and by women who were related to those who had fallen. In Greece, funeral orations were pronounced only at public funerals of the kind described, not, as at Rome, over individuals, even though they were specially distinguished (Dion. Hal. v. 17). <cb /> This custom seems to have arisen about the time of the Persian Wars. In other respects the procedure at a public funeral does not seem to have differed from that in use at private burials.</p>
 <p>In spite of the statement of Lucian (<title>De Luctu</title>, 21) that the Greeks burned their dead and the Persians buried them, it is certain, both from literary evidence and also from the excavation of tombs, that burning and burying were both practised by the Greeks. The word <foreign lang="greek">θάπτειν</foreign> is used of the burial of the ashes after cremation, but <foreign lang="greek">κατορύττειν</foreign> refers only to the burial of an unburned body. We hear of burial also among the Spartans ( <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Lyc.</title>27</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 134" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 134</bibl>). In Homer there is no mention of any burial without burning; but in graves at Mycenae, skeletons have been found which showed no traces of fire. Evidence both of burning and burying has been found in graves of a <figure id="fig.00696.2">
<head orig="Funeral Pyre.">Funeral Pyre.</head>
</figure> later date in many parts of the Greek world. See Hermann-Blümner, <title>Privatalterth.</title> p. 375.</p>
 <p>The pile of wood (<foreign lang="greek">πυρά</foreign>) upon which the body was burned was sometimes erected over the grave in which the ashes were to be buried. There is a full description of cremation in the Homeric period in <title>Iliad</title> (xxiii. 161 foll.), where Achilles celebrates the funeral of Patroclus. The pyre was made a hundred feet in length and breadth, and the bodies of sheep, oxen, horses, dogs, and twelve Trojan captives were placed upon it. Honey and perfumes were also poured upon it before it was lighted. When the pyre had burned down, the remains of the fire were quenched with wine, and the relatives and friends collected the bones or ashes ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24. 791" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xxiv. 791</bibl>). The remains thus collected were placed in a receptacle sometimes of gold, but generally of a less precious material, and buried. A description of these receptacles, of the other articles placed in the tomb, and of the tomb itself will be found in the article <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>. 
<pb n="697" /><cb /></p>
 <p>When bodies were buried without previous cremation, they were generally placed in coffins, which were called by various names, as <foreign lang="greek">σοροί, πύελολτ;γτ;, ληνοί, λάρνακες, δροῖται</foreign>, though some of these names were also applied to the urns in which the bones were collected. For further information upon this point, see the article <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>Immediately after the funeral was over, the relatives partook of a feast which was called <foreign lang="greek">περίδειπνον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">νεκρόδειπνον</foreign> (Lucian, <title>De Luctu</title>, 24). It was the custom that this feast should be given at the house of the nearest relative (Demosth. <title>De Cor.</title> p. 321. 355). </p>
 <p>Other ceremonies were performed on the third, the ninth, and the thirtieth days after the funeral, and were called respectively <foreign lang="greek">τρίτα, ἔνατα</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τριακάς</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">τριακάδες</foreign> ( <bibl n="Poll.  8. 146" default="NO">Poll.viii. 146</bibl>). The rites on the thirtieth day ( <bibl n="Poll.  1. 66" default="NO">Poll.i. 66</bibl><bibl n="Poll.  3. 102" default="NO">Poll., iii. 102</bibl>) included a repetition of the funeral feast.</p>
 <p>It was also the custom to bring offerings to the tomb on certain days in each year (Plato, <title>De Leg.</title> iv. 717 E). Herodotus mentions that these annual sacrifices to the dead were called <foreign lang="greek">γενέσια</foreign> (iv. 26), from which it is inferred that they were offered on the birthday of the deceased (cf. <bibl n="Diog.  10. 18" default="NO">Diog. Laert.x. 18</bibl>). The name <foreign lang="greek">νεκύσια</foreign> was also used in the same sense. The ceremonies which were performed at these stated intervals might be used at any other time, if for some reason it was necessary to appease the departed spirit. The word <foreign lang="greek">ἐναγίζειν</foreign> was used for the act of offering, <foreign lang="greek">ἐναγίσματα</foreign> for the things offered on these occasions. These consisted of libations (<foreign lang="greek">χοαί</foreign>) of wine, oil, milk, honey mixed with water or milk ( <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 609" default="NO" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title>609</bibl> foll.), which were poured upon the ground (<foreign lang="greek">γάποτοι</foreign>,  <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 621" default="NO" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title>621</bibl>). Elaborate banquets were sometimes prepared, burned in honour of the dead, and buried in a trench (Lucian, <bibl n="Thphr. Char. 22" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Char.</title>22</bibl>). Wreaths <figure id="fig.00697.2"><head>The <title>Conclamatio</title>, or lamentation for the dead. (From a Roman relief.)</head></figure> <cb /> were also placed upon the grave-stones, and they were anointed with perfumes.</p>
 <p>The period of mourning varied in length at different places. At Athens the <foreign lang="greek">τριακάς</foreign> seems to have ended it on the thirtieth day after the funeral (Lysias, <title>De Caede Erat.</title> 14). At Sparta it lasted only eleven days ( <bibl n="Plut. Lyc. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Lyc.</title>27</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Certain special rites were used in particular cases. A spear was carried in front of the body of any person who had died a violent death, as a symbol of the revenge which was to follow the murderer (Eurip. <bibl default="NO"><title>Troad.</title> 1148</bibl>). In the case of those who had committed suicide, the hand which had done the deed was cut off and buried separately ( <title>in Ctes.</title> 244). Certain criminals, who were put to death by the State, were also deprived of burial, which was considered to be an additional punishment ( <bibl n="Plut. Them. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Them.</title>22</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 134" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 134</bibl>). The bodies of those persons who had been struck by lightning were regarded as sacred (<foreign lang="greek">ἱεροὶ νεκροί</foreign>); they were not buried with others (Eurip. <title>Suppl.</title> 935), but usually on the spot where they had been struck ( <title>Oneirocr.</title> ii. 9, p. 146).</p>
 <p>It has been already mentioned that in the public funerals of those killed in war, an empty couch was carried in the procession to represent those whose bodies had not been found. In other cases, where a person was supposed to be dead, though his body was not found, funeral rites were performed for him (Eurip. <bibl n="Eur. Hel. 1241" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hel.</title>1241</bibl> foll.). If such a person was afterwards found to be alive, he was considered impure, and was not allowed to enter temples till certain rites had been performed. These rites consisted in a symbolism of birth and the ceremonies connected with it. The <foreign lang="greek">δευτερόποτμος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ὑστερόποτμος</foreign> was washed, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and fed with milk. Having been thus born again into life, he was freed from his impurity ( <title>Q. R.</title> 5).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>.—Among the Romans also the burial of the dead was a most solemn duty. It was incumbent upon any one who found an unburied body at least to cast earth upon it three times ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 1. 28" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>i. 28</bibl>). If no funeral rites had been performed, the soul of the dead man could not be received among the shades, but wandered homeless upon the earth (Tertull. <title>De Anim.</title> 56).</p>
 <p>A near relative of the dying person caught the last breath in his mouth ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 4. 684" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>iv. 684</bibl>). As soon as he was dead his eyes were closed by one of those present (Lucan. <title>Phars.</title> iii. 740). Then followed the <seg lang="la">conclamatio</seg>, variously explained as (1) a cry <seg lang="la">in articulo mortis</seg>, which seems probable from Propertius (v. 7, 23; cf. Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 3, 43) 
<pb n="698" /><cb /></p>
 <p>(2) the recall of the dead by uttering his or her name three times, in order to ascertain the fact of death if there was no answer—a custom still in use at the death-bed of a Pope;</p>
 <p>(3) as commonly understood, the lamentation for the dead when there was no longer any possibility of doubt. The mourners called repeatedly the name of the deceased, with loud cries, and exclamations such as <seg lang="la">vale</seg> (Lucan, <title>Phars.</title> ii. 22; Catullus, ci.; Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10. 62" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>x. 62</bibl>, <title>Fasti</title>, iv, 852).</p>
 <p>The body was then washed with warm water and anointed with perfumes and spices ( <bibl n="Pers.  3. 103" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iii. 103</bibl>). That this took place after the <seg lang="la">conclamatio</seg> is learned from Ammianus Marcellinus (xxx. 10). The corpse was then clothed either in the toga ( <bibl n="Juv.  3. 173" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 173</bibl> with Mayor's note), or in the state robes of any office which had been held by the deceased (<bibl n="Liv.  34. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxiv. 7</bibl>; Polyb. vi. 53). The garments in which the corpse was clothed were sometimes splendid and costly (<seg lang="la">vestes purpureae</seg>,  <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 221" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 221</bibl>; <seg lang="la">pretiosae</seg>, Val. Max. v. 5, 4). Precious ornaments were often added. Rings, for example, are often found in graves, and we learn from Propertius (iv. 7, 9) that they were sometimes burned with the body. Flowers were also used for the adornment of the couch on which the corpse was laid; and a censer (<seg lang="la">acerra</seg>) was placed beside it (  <title>Epit.</title>p. 18). The following illustration from a Roman relief in the Lateran Museum (Baumeister, p. 239) represents the <seg lang="la">lectus funebris</seg>, on which the corpse of a woman lies dressed. Two women mourners (<seg lang="la">praeficae</seg>) stand behind, and by their side a man in the act of putting a garland on the head of the corpse. On each side of the <seg lang="la">lectus funebris</seg> is a torch. On the left side is a woman blowing the flute, and above another with folded hands; on the right side sit three women, wearing the <seg lang="la">pilleus</seg> (probably manumitted slaves); below is the family of the deceased. Among the Romans, as among the Greeks, it was customary to place a small coin in the mouth of the deceased, for the purpose of paying Charon 's passage-money. <figure id="fig.00698">
<head orig="The Lectus Funebris. (Lateran Museum, Rome.)">The Lectus Funebris. (Lateran Museum, Rome.)</head>
</figure> This is alluded to by Juvenal (iii. 267) and Propertius (iv. 11, 7), but not by earlier writers. Coins, however, have been found in graves of an earlier date than the Second Punic War (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. p. 27); and in graves at Praenesté, dating from the third century B.C., coins were actually found in the <cb /> mouths of the skeletons (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. 28). In imperial times the practice was common.</p>
 <p>The preparations necessary for the due laying out of the body were performed by the <seg lang="la">pollinctores</seg> (Plaut. <bibl n="Luc. Asin. 5. 2" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Asin.</title>v. 2</bibl><bibl n="Luc. Asin. 60" default="NO" valid="yes"> Asin., 60</bibl>), who probably took the cast of the dead man's face, from which the wax <seg lang="la">imago</seg> was made, to be kept in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> of the house by his descendants, and used in funeral processions in a way shortly to be described. The <seg lang="la">pollinctor</seg> was furnished by the <seg lang="la">libitinarius</seg> or undertaker, who entered into a contract for conducting the whole funeral. The latter got his name from the fact that he exercised his business at the temple or grove of Libitina, the goddess of corpses and funerals ( <bibl n="Plut. Num. 12. 1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Num.</title>12. 1</bibl>; <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 23). Deaths were also registered at this temple ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 39" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>39</bibl>), and the offering called <title>lucar Libitinae</title> was made. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslucar">Lucar</ref>.</p>
 <p>When the body had been thus prepared and adorned, it was laid upon a couch of state, generally in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg> of the house, with the feet towards the door ( <bibl n="Pers.  3. 105" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iii. 105</bibl>). Outside the door of the house were placed branches of cypress or pine ( <title>ad Aen.</title> iii. 64), for the purpose of warning those who might be polluted by entering a house in which was a corpse. The cypress was apparently only used by those of good position. We are told by Servius (<title>ad Aen.</title> v. 64) that the corpse lay in state for seven days before burial. This can only have been the case in exceptional circumstances, when some form of embalming was used.</p>
 <p>Funerals were conducted by the family of the deceased (<seg lang="la">funus privatum</seg>), except in cases where a public funeral (<seg lang="la">funus publicum</seg>) was voted, either by the Senate ( <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 9. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>ix. 7</bibl>) or in provincial towns by the <seg lang="la">decuriones</seg>, as a mark of honour or respect to the deceased. This honour was paid in the case of foreign kings who died in Italy (Val. Max. v. 1, 1); and men who had fallen in the service of their country (Val. Max. v. 2, 10).</p>
 <p>A public invitation was given to all important funerals by a herald (<seg lang="la">praeco</seg>). Hence the phrases <seg lang="la">funus indicere, funus indictivum</seg> ( <title>Iul.</title> 84; <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 24, 61). The formula of invitation has been preserved: “<hi rend="SmallCaps">Ollus Quiris Leto Datus. Exsequias, Quibus est commodum, ire iam tempus est. Ollus ex aedibus effertur</hi>.” ( Fest. p. 254 d<bibl n="Fest.  34." default="NO" valid="yes">Fest., 34.</bibl>) <title>Translaticium funus</title> is used for an unceremonious burial ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 33" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>33</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In ancient times all funerals took place by night ( <title>ad Aen.</title> xi. 143); in later times only those of children ( Serv. l. c.), and poor people whose means did not admit of sufficient display for the day-time ( <bibl n="Mart.  8. 75" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.viii. 75</bibl>). The torches with which funerals were always accompanied were probably a relic of burial by night, though no doubt they also served for lighting the pyre.</p>
 <p>An opportunity for the display of splendour was given by the funeral procession, and was so largely used by families of wealth and position that sumptuary laws to regulate such expenses are found among the Tables of the Decemviri ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 59) and the enactments of Sulla ( <bibl n="Plut. Sull. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sull.</title>35</bibl>). The order of the funeral procession was regulated by the <seg lang="la">designator</seg> or <seg lang="la">dissignator</seg>, whose attendants were dressed in black. The order in which the various parts of the procession came is uncertain, but it is generally supposed that at the head of it were the musicians (<seg lang="la">siticines</seg>), who made 
<pb n="699" /><cb />
 use of <seg lang="la">tubae, tibiae</seg>, and <seg lang="la">cornua.</seg> The number of <seg lang="la">tibicines</seg> was by the Twelve Tables limited to ten ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 59). Then followed (at any rate in earlier times) the mourning women, called <seg lang="la">praeficae</seg>, who sang the <seg lang="la">nenia</seg> or <seg lang="la">lessus</seg>, a mournful song in praise of the dead man ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 24, 62). Then followed in some cases dancers and <seg lang="la">mimi</seg> ( <title>Iul.</title> 84), who were allowed, as at a triumph, free license of jesting. We learn from Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 19" default="NO"> <title>Vesp.</title>19</bibl>) that it was the custom for the <seg lang="la">archimimus</seg> to wear a mask in the likeness of the deceased, to imitate his speech and manners, and even to make jests at his expense.</p>
 <p>The most striking part of the procession was probably formed by the <seg lang="la">imagines.</seg> It is said by Polybius (vi. 53) that the <seg lang="la">imagines</seg>, or wax masks representing distinguished ancestors of the deceased, were brought out from their resting-place in the <seg lang="la">atrium</seg>, and each was worn by a man chosen to resemble as nearly as possible the person whom he was supposed to represent and clothed in the dress of the office which the prototype of the mask had held. Each rode upon a chariot, and was accompanied with due pomp of lictors and other insignia of his office. Thus all the distinguished ancestors of the dead man were present in effigy at his funeral. If he was of good birth, many families to which he was related were represented by their <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 76" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 76</bibl>), and the actual number was sometimes very great. At the funeral of Marcellus there are said to have been 600 ( <title>ad Aen.</title> vi. 802). Sometimes, as a special honour, spoils, crowns, and other records of victories and triumphs were carried before the bier. The procession was also swelled by the slaves who were liberated by the will of the deceased, all with shorn heads, wearing the <seg lang="la">pilleus</seg> (<bibl n="Liv.  38. 55" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, xxxviii. 55</bibl>). The bier itself was sometimes carried by these liberated slaves ( <bibl n="Pers.  3. 106" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.iii. 106</bibl>); or in the case of emperors, by magistrates and senators ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 100" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>100</bibl>). The body was placed uncovered on a bier or couch (<seg lang="la">feretrum, torus</seg>), which in great funerals was elaborately decorated ( <title>Iul.</title> 84). In some cases, probably when decay had begun to disfigure the features, the body was placed in a coffin (<seg lang="la">capulus</seg>), and a waxen representation (<hi rend="italic">effigics</hi>) was exposed to view instead ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 5</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In the burial of the poor and of slaves of course this pomp was absent. Hired bearers (<seg lang="la">vespillones</seg>), six ( <bibl n="Mart.  6. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vi. 77</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  10" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 10</bibl>) or four (id. viii. 75<bibl n="Mart.  9" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 9</bibl>) in number, carried the body in a simple wooden coffin or bier, which was not buried with the body (<seg lang="la">sandapila</seg>, <bibl n="Mart.  2. 81" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.ii. 81</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The relatives of the deceased followed behind the bier, dressed in mourning. The sons of the deceased had their heads veiled, while the daughters went uncovered and with dishevelled hair ( <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 11). Mourning was shown by very much the same signs as in modern times— viz., by the absence of adornment and the wearing of black garments ( <bibl n="Juv.  10. 245" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.x. 245</bibl>; <bibl n="Prop.  5. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop.v. 7</bibl><bibl n="Prop.  28" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 28</bibl>;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 2</bibl>; <seg lang="la">pullus</seg>, <bibl n="Juv.  3. 213" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 213</bibl>). Under the emperors white seems to have been substituted for black as the mourning colour for women ( <title>Quaest. Rom.</title> 26;  <bibl n="Stat. Silv. 3. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. <title>Silv.</title>iii. 3</bibl><bibl n="Stat. Silv. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Stat. Silv., 3</bibl>). The women were also in the habit of crying aloud, tearing their hair and lacerating their cheeks in the funeral procession itself ( <bibl n="Prop.  3. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop.iii. 13</bibl><bibl n="Prop.  27" default="NO" valid="yes">Prop., 27</bibl>).</p>
 <p>In this order the funeral train proceeded to the Forum. There it halted before the Rostra, the <cb /> wearers of the <seg lang="la">imagines</seg> took their seats upon curule chairs, and the <seg lang="la">laudatio funebris</seg> was pronounced, generally by a near relative of the deceased (Polyb. vi. 53), though in the case of a <seg lang="la">funus publicum</seg> this function might be assigned by a <hi rend="italic">senatusconsultum</hi> to one of the magistrates ( <title>Instit.</title> iii. 7, 2).</p>
 <p>From the Forum the procession moved on to the place of burning or burial, which, according to a law of the Twelve Tables, was obliged to be outside the city, though special exceptions were sometimes made ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 58). Both burning and burial were in use among the Romans. Cicero (<title>De Leg.</title> ii. 22, 56) and Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7.  187" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 187</bibl>) both hold the view that burial was the more ancient custom. Pliny further says that burning was introduced because it was found that the bodies of those killed in distant countries and buried there were dug up and scattered by the enemy. It is conjectured, however, that the change was partly brought about by motives of health and convenience. In certain families the practice of burial was kept up, after burning had become general. Sulla was the first of the Cornelii to be burned. The reason, according to Cicero and Pliny , of the departure from the custom of his family was, that he feared lest his own bones should receive the same treatment as he had given to those of Marius. In later times burning became far more common than burial, though the latter was always used in the case of children who died before they had cut their teeth ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 72" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>vii. 72</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  15. 140" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.xv. 140</bibl>), and in the case of those who had been struck by lightning. It seems also that persons of the poorest classes were always buried. After the introduction of Christianity burial again came into use instead of burning. The view that burial was older than cremation is confirmed by some Roman customs. According to pontifical law, the essential part of the funeral ceremony was the casting of earth upon the face of the corpse ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 22, 57). Again, when a body was to be burned, it was the custom to cut off some portion of it, called <seg lang="la">os resectum</seg>, which was subsequently buried (  <title>Epit.</title>p. 148). By this means the newer and more convenient method was adopted, while the ancient regulation which prescribed burial was still carried out.</p>
 <p>The remaining rites varied, according as the body was to be buried or burned. In the case of burial the body was placed in the grave either on the bier on which it had been carried, or in a sarcophagus. Numerous objects were also placed in the grave. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssepulcrum">Sepulcrum</ref>.) The ceremonies which followed had the double object of making the grave a <seg lang="la">locus religiosus</seg>, and of purifying the family and house which had been defiled by the presence of a corpse. Earth was thrown upon the face of the dead ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 22, 57), a pig was sacrificed, and an offering was made to the Lares. The day on which these sacrifices took place was called <seg lang="la">feriae denicales</seg> (  <title>Epit.</title>p. 70). A funeral feast called <seg lang="la">silicernium</seg> was also held, apparently on the day of the funeral, and by the grave (Varr. <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Non. p. 48<bibl n="Non.  8" default="NO" valid="yes">Non., 8</bibl>). The period of mourning lasted nine days (<seg lang="la">novendiale</seg>), though it is uncertain whether this period was reckoned from the day of death or the day of burial ( <title>ad Aen.</title> v. 64). At the end of this period a <seg lang="la">sacrificium novendiale</seg> was offered to the dead, and a <seg lang="la">cena novendialis</seg> was held ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 6. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>vi. 5</bibl>). 
<pb n="700" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The burning of a body sometimes took place at the spot where the ashes were to be interred. In this case the funeral pile (<seg lang="la">rogus, pyra</seg>) was erected over the trench which was subsequently to be the grave (<seg lang="la">bustum</seg>). The body, however, was often burned at a place near the monument, specially destined for this purpose, <seg lang="la">ustrinum, ustrina</seg> (  <title>Epit.</title>p. 32). The pyre was built of wood, in the form of an altar ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 177" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 177</bibl>). A law of the Twelve Tables ordered that it should not be smoothed with an axe ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 23, 59). Pyres were sometimes painted ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.  49" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 49</bibl>), and cypress-trees were placed in front (Ovid, <title>Trist.</title> iii. 13, 21). On the top of the pile the corpse was placed, with the couch on which it had been carried. Many things were placed on the pyre by the relations and mourners, such as clothes, arms, ornaments, hunting nets and apparatus, horses, dogs, birds ( <title>Epist.</title> iv. 2). It was also sprinkled with perfumes, gums, and spices.</p>
 <p>The pyre was lighted by one of the relatives, with face turned away ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 224" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 224</bibl>). When it was burned down, the glowing ashes were extinguished with water or wine ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 226" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 226</bibl>). Those who had taken part in the funeral uttered a last farewell ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 2. 644" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>ii. 644</bibl>) and departed, while the nearest relatives remained to collect the bones and ashes when they were dry. This was probably done as a rule on the day of the funeral. The bones were sprinkled with wine (though it is not certain that this sprinkling is to be separated from that mentioned above), dried with a linen cloth, and placed in an urn or box with perfumes and spices. The urn was then placed in the sepulchre.</p>
 <p>It has already been mentioned that if the body was burned, the <seg lang="la">os resectum</seg> was buried separately. The ceremonies of the <seg lang="la">feriae denicales</seg> were used, as in the case of the burial, including the throwing of earth upon the remains of the dead ( <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 22, 57). It does not appear at what moment this was done; but the object of it was to consecrate the place of burial, to make it a <seg lang="la">locus religiosus.</seg> After the bones and ashes of the deceased had been placed in the urn, the persons present were thrice sprinkled by a priest with pure water from a branch of olive or laurel, for the purpose of purification ( <bibl n="Verg. A. 6. 229" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>vi. 229</bibl>); after which they were dismissed by the <seg lang="la">praefica</seg> or some other person, by the solemn word <title>Ilicet</title>, that is, <seg lang="la">ire licet.</seg> In the case of burning, the practices connected with the <seg lang="la">silicernium</seg> and the <seg lang="la">novendiale</seg> seem to have been the same as in the case of burial (see above). When those who had accompanied the funeral returned home, they underwent a purification called <seg lang="la">suffitio</seg>, which consisted in being sprinkled with water and stepping over a fire ( Fest. p. 3). It was then also, perhaps, that the house was swept with a special kind of broom ( Fest. p. 58, s. v. <title>Everriator</title>).</p>
 <p>In the case of important funerals, scenic or gladiatorial exhibitions were often given. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossgladiatores">Gladiatores</ref>.) Scenic exhibitions were less common; but the Didascalia to the <title>Adelphoe</title> of Terence states that that play was performed at the <seg lang="la">ludi funebres</seg> of Aemilius Paullus (B.C. 160), and we are informed by Livy that <seg lang="la">ludi scenici</seg> as well as gladiatorial combats were exhibited at the death of T. Flamininus (B.C. 174). There were also distributions of food (<seg lang="la">viscerationes</seg>) and public banquets ( <title>Iul.</title> 26). <cb /></p>
 <p>It remains to give some account of the annual rites performed at the tombs in honour of the Manes. Certain days in February (13th-21st) were set apart as <seg lang="la">dies parentales</seg>, or <seg lang="la">parentalia.</seg> The last of these days was specially known as <seg lang="la">feralia</seg> (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, ii. 569). The ceremonies performed at this time are described by Ovid (<title>Fasti</title>, ii. 533 foll.). Offerings to the Manes (<seg lang="la">inferiae</seg>) were brought to the tomb. These consisted of wine and milk, honey and oil, the blood of victims, especially of black sheep, pigs, and cattle (Arnob. vii. 20), various fruits, bread, salt, and eggs ( <bibl n="Juv.  5. 84" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.v. 84</bibl>). The tomb was adorned with wreaths and flowers, especially roses and violets (Ovid, l. c.). A meal was also eaten at the grave. A <seg lang="la">triclinium funebre</seg>, intended apparently for this purpose, was found at Pompeii and is represented in the accompanying illustration. During the <seg lang="la">dies parentales</seg> temples were <figure id="fig.00700">
<head orig="Funereal Triclinium. (Pompeii.)">Funereal Triclinium. (Pompeii.)</head>
</figure> shut and marriages forbidden (Ovid, <title>Fasti</title>, ii. 557 foll.), and the magistrates laid aside the insignia of their office (Lydus, <title>De Mens.</title> iv. 24). The terms <seg lang="la">parentare, parentatio</seg>, were also applied to similar rites performed on other days of the year, such as the day of birth, death, or burial of the person to be honoured. Special days were also appropriated to roses and violets (<seg lang="la">rosatio, rosaria, rosalia, violatio;</seg>  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21.  11" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H.

Am. 1.1.132" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Amphit.</title> i. 1, 132</bibl>, and often).</p>

 <p> An early Latin goddess, whose name, in the time of Varro, was known to very few (Varr. <title>L. L.</title> v. 3). There was a sacred grove of this goddess beyond the Tiber (in which Gaius Gracchus was slain), and this, with the similitude of the name, led Cicero and others to identify Furian with the Furies ( <bibl n="Cic.

 <p> Theft; the robbery of movable things, though furtum could be committed without actually carrying off the object, as in the case of a thing deposited (<seg lang="la">depositum</seg>), the unlawful use of which was furtum. Furtum was either <seg lang="la">manifestum</seg> or not, the former when the thief was caught in the act. It was called <seg lang="la">furtum conceptum</seg> when a stolen object was found in a person's possession; and if a person gave to a third person stolen goods, the third person could bring an <seg lang="la">actio furti oblati</seg> against the giver. The punishment for <seg lang="la">furtum manifestum</seg> was <seg lang="la">capitalis</seg>—i. e. affecting one's <seg lang="la">caput</seg> (q. v.). A thief killed while committing robbery at night was held by the Twelve Tables to be lawfully killed; but in the daytime he could be killed only when he resisted with a deadly weapon (<seg lang="la">telum</seg>).

The distaff and spindle, with the wool and thread upon them, were carried in bridal processions; and without the wool and thread, they were often suspended by women as offerings of religious gratitude, especially in old age, or on relinquishing the constant use of them. They were most frequently dedicated to Minerva, the patroness of spinning, and of the arts connected with it. The spindle was kept in the <seg lang="la">calathus</seg> (q. v.).

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
<note id="ref2" target="n2">* Balnea is, however, used in the singular to designate a private bath in an inscription quoted by Reinesius (Inscr. xi. 115).</note>
