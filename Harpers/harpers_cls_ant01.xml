 <p> the first letter in both the Greek and Latin alphabets. The principal uses of the letter in abbreviations found in MSS. and inscriptions, or on coins, are given below.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">In Greek</hi>.—Abbreviations of one or even of two letters are of extreme rarity on Greek coins and inscriptions of the pre-Euclidean period; after this time a few instances occur, owing doubtless to Roman influence, their use being chiefly confined to a few Roman proper names, e. g. A=<foreign lang="greek">Αὐλός, Αὐρήλιος, Ἀντωνῖνος</foreign>. With the general introduction of alphabetic numerals, about the beginning of the fifth century B.C., the letter A, <foreign lang="greek">ά</foreign>, is also used as a numeral for 1 and 1000 (<foreign lang="greek">α</foreign>). Cf. S. <bibl default="NO">Reinach, <title>Traité d'Épigraphie Grecque</title> (1885)</bibl>, pp. 220 ff. 225 ff.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">In Latin</hi>.—The Romans made an astonishingly extensive use of abbreviations. Only a very few out of many thousands recorded in the indexes to the <title>C. I.

 <p>(2) A dice-board. See <ref type="cross" target="crossduodecim-scripta">Duodecim Scripta</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslatrunculi">Latrunculi</ref>.</p>
 <p>(3) A mathematician's table strewn with fine sand, on which figures were drawn with a <seg lang="la">stilus.</seg></p>
 <p>(4) A counting-board, on which sums were worked for private and public accounts. This might be:
 <list type="simple">
 <item>A tablet with a frame or rim, covered with sand, in which lines or figures could be drawn either with the finger or some pointed instrument; and used in geometry, arithmetic, etc. ( <bibl n="Pers.  1. 131" default="NO" valid="yes">Pers.i. 131</bibl>; <seg lang="la">eruditus pulvis</seg>,  <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 2. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>N. D.</title>ii. 18</bibl><bibl n="Cic. N.D. 48" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. N. D., 48</bibl>). The name <seg lang="la">arenarius</seg>, applied to the elementary teacher, implies that this sort of abacus was used by school-children.</item>
 <item>A development of this simple form was the abacus on which <foreign lang="greek">ψῆφοι</foreign>, <seg lang="la">calculi</seg>, pebbles or counters, were employed in calculations. It was a board marked off by ridges or grooves (along which balls, counters, or buttons could be moved) into compartments, for the several orders of numbers. We have examples of both Greek and Roman abaci. The Greek abacus figured here is from Salamis, and is of marble, about forty inches long by twentyeight broad. At a distance of ten inches from one of the sides are marked five parallel lines. At twenty inches' distance from the last of these, eleven others are marked and bisected by a cross <figure id="fig.00002">
<head orig="Greek Abacus, or Calculating Table.">Greek Abacus, or Calculating Table.</head>
</figure> line, the point of whose intersection with the third, sixth, and ninth lines is marked by a star. Along three of the sides is arranged a series of characters in the same order, and so as to be read with equal ease whichever way the abacus is turned: the series on one side having two more characters than the others. These characters (<figure /> being known as = drachma) gives the following scale, reckoned from the left of <figure />: <figure /></item>
 </list></p>
 <p>These characters are of great antiquity. <figure /> is a mutilated <figure />, initial of <foreign lang="greek">ἓν</foreign>; <figure /> an old form of <figure />, i. e. <foreign lang="greek">πέντε; Δ</foreign> obviously represents <foreign lang="greek">δέκα</foreign>, and <figure /> <foreign lang="greek">χίλιοι</foreign>; while of the three remaining characters, <figure /> is for <figure />, the old way of writing <foreign lang="greek">ἑκατόν</foreign>, <figure /> is <figure /> with <foreign lang="greek">Δ</foreign> inscribed, <figure /> with <figure /> The characters on the right of <figure /> are <figure />=obol, <figure />=1/2 obol, <figure />=1/4 obol, <figure />=<foreign lang="greek">χαλκοῦς</foreign>, 1/8 obol. The two additional characters in the left-hand series are <figure />=5000 (<figure /> with <figure /> inscribed), and <figure />=talent (of 6000 drachmas); so <cb /> that the lowest and highest money units are at the two ends of the scale.</p>
 <p>To understand the use of this abacus, the calculator must be supposed sitting before one of its long sides, and putting counters into the spaces between the marked lines. Each space represents an order of numerals, the space on the right hand being intended for units, the next space for tens, the next for hundreds, and so on. The numbers belonging to the first four of each series are put on that side of the bisecting line which is nearest the calculator; those over five are put beyond it. As five spaces out of the ten would be enough for these purposes, it is conjectured that after the progression of drachmas going up to 5000, a fresh progression of talents began (<figure />=6000 drachmas), going up to the seventh place (1,000,000). Thus the Greek abacus, like the Roman, which was no doubt derived from it, reckoned up to a million. The fractions of the drachma were reckoned on the five lines at the other end of the slab. It is to an abacus of this kind that Polybius refers, when he compares the ups and downs of court favorites to the <foreign lang="greek">ψῆφοι</foreign> on an <foreign lang="greek">ἀβάκιον</foreign>, which, according to the line in which they are placed, may signify either a talent or a chalcus (Polyb. v. 26. 13). This comparison is elsewhere attributed to Solon ( <bibl n="Diog.  1. 59" default="NO">Diog. Laert.i. 59</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The Roman abacus (figured here from the Kircherian Museum at Rome) was on the same system. <figure id="fig.00002.2">
<head orig="Roman Abacus, or Calculating Table.">Roman Abacus, or Calculating Table.</head>
</figure> It is divided into eight lower and eight higher (somewhat shorter) grooves: there is also a ninth lower groove, without an upper groove to correspond. Four sliding buttons are attached to each lower groove except the eighth, which has five: each upper groove has one button. Between the two sets of grooves the following numbers are marked: <figure /></p>
 <p>The units of any other number when not above 4 are marked by moving a corresponding number of buttons along the lower groove upwards, the button in the upper groove=5. The eighth row was used by reckoning fractions (<seg lang="la">aes recurrens</seg>) on the duodecimal system, by ounces, or twelfth of the <hi rend="italic">as</hi>, and is accordingly marked <figure /> or <figure /> = uncia: each of its five lower buttons=1 ounce, and the upper one=6. Fractions below an ounce were reckoned on the ninth groove, marked: <figure /></p>

<head orig="Abae">Abae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄβαι</foreign>). A city of Phocis, near and to the right of Elatea, towards Opus. The inhabitants had a tradition that their city was founded by Abas, son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra, grandson of Danaus ( <bibl n="Paus.  10.35" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.10.35</bibl>). It was most probably of Pelasgic origin. Abae was early celebrated for its oracle of Apollo, of greater antiquity than that at Delphi, and hence Apollo is called Abaeus. During the Persian invasion, the army of Xerxes set fire to the temple, and nearly destroyed it; soon after it again gave oracles, though in this dilapidated state, and was consulted for that purpose by an agent of Mardonius ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 134" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 134</bibl>).

<head orig="Aborigĭnes">Aborigines</head>

 <p> A name given by the Roman writers to the primitive race, who were thought to have blended with the Siculi, and founded subsequently the nation of the Latins. The name is equivalent to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">αὐτόχθονες</foreign>, as indicating an indigenous race. According to tradition, they dwelt originally around Mount Velino, and Lake Fucinus, extending as far as Carseoli, and towards Reate. This was Cato's account (<bibl n="D.H.  2. 49" default="NO">Dionys. H. ii. 49</bibl>). The Aborigines are depicted by Sallust and Vergil as savages living in hordes, without manners, law, or agriculture, on the produce of the chase, and on wild fruits. This, however, does not agree with the traces of their towns in the Apennines; but the whole account was, perhaps, little else than an ancient speculation on the progress of mankind from rudeness to civilization. The Aborigines are said to have revered Ianus and Saturn. The latter taught them husbandry, and induced them to choose settled habitations, as the founders of a better way of life. From this ancient race, as has already been remarked, blending with a remnant of the Siculi, the nation of the Latins was said to have sprung; and between Saturn and the time assigned for the Trojan settlement, only three kings of the Aborigines are enumerated—Picus, Faunus, and Latinus. As to the name of this early race, the old and genuine one seems to have been <cb /> Casci; and the appellation Aborigines was only given them by the later Roman writers.

<head orig="Abortio, Abortus">Abortio, Abortus</head>

 <p> If we may judge from poets and satirists, it was not an uncommon practice among the Romans to procure abortion (<bibl n="Pl. Truc. 202" default="NO" valid="yes">Plaut. <title>Truc.</title>202</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv.  2. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.ii. 32</bibl>; <bibl n="Juv. 6.368" default="NO" valid="yes">vi. 368</bibl>). Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. Clu. 12" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Clu.</title>12</bibl>) relates a case where a testator, leaving his wife pregnant, endeavours to secure the birth of his son by leaving his wife a handsome bequest if his son become heir, and nothing if he does not. Cicero charges Oppianicus with paying the amount contingently bequeathed to the widow, and procuring abortion in order that Oppianicus's son may succeed to the inheritance. A woman at Miletus, who in similar circumstances procured abortion by the use of drugs, was condemned to death in the time of Cicero's proconsulate. It was probably some such dangers that led to the Cornelia Lex, making it a criminal offence to give love-potions or medicines for abortion ( <bibl n="Paul. Sent. 5. 23" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul. <title>Sent.</title>v. 23</bibl><bibl n="Paul. Sent. 214" default="NO" valid="yes">Paul. Sent., 214</bibl>). All women who procured abortion were, by a rescript of Severus and Caracalla, condemned to exile.</p>
 <p>Of the practice and law in Greece still less is known. Lysias in a speech, or declamation, impeached Antigonus for procuring abortion (<foreign lang="greek">κατ Ἀντιγόνου ἀμβλώσεως</foreign>, <title>Fragm.</title> 10, ed. Bait. and Sauppe).

<head orig="Academia">Academia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀκαδήμεια</foreign>). (1) A public garden or grove in the suburbs of Athens, about six stadia from the city, named from Academus or Hecademus, who left it to the citizens for gymnastics ( <bibl n="Paus.  1. 29" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus.i. 29</bibl>). It was surrounded with a wall by Hipparchus, adorned with statues, temples, and sepulchres of illustrious men; planted with olive and plane trees, and watered by the Cephissus. The olive-trees, according to Athenian fables, were reared from layers taken from the sacred olive in the Erechtheum, and afforded the oil given as a prize to victors at the Panathenaean festival. Few retreats could be more favorable to philosophy and the Muses. Within this enclosure Plato possessed, as part of his patrimony, a small garden, in which he opened a school for the reception of those inclined to attend his instructions. Hence arose the Academic sect, and hence the term Academy has descended to our times. The appellation <title>Academia</title> is frequently used in philosophical writings, especially in Cicero, as indicative of the Academic sect. See <ref type="cross" target="crossphilosophia">Philosophia</ref>.</p>
 <p>Sextus Empiricus enumerates five divisions of the followers of Plato. He makes Plato founder of the first Academy, Arcesilaüs of the second, Carneades of the third, Philo and Charmides of the fourth, Antiochus of the fifth. Cicero recognizes only two Academies, the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Old</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">New</hi>, and makes the latter commence as above with Arcesilaus. In enumerating those of the Old Academy, he begins, not with Plato, but Democritus, and gives them in the following order: Democritus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Parmenides, Xenophanes, Socrates, Plato, Speusippus, Xenocrates, Polemo, Crates, and Crantor. In the New, or Younger, he mentions Arcesilaüs, Lacydes, Evander, Hegesinus, Carneades, Clitomachus, and Philo ( <bibl n="Philo A.Q. 4. 5" default="NO">Philo <title>Acad. Quaest.</title>iv. 5</bibl>). If we follow the distinction laid down by Diogenes, and alluded to above, the Old Academy will consist of those followers of Plato who taught the doctrine of their master without mixture or corruption; the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Middle</hi> will embrace those who, by certain innovations in the manner of philosophizing, in some measure receded from the Platonic system without entirely deserting it; while the <hi rend="SmallCaps">New</hi> will begin with those who relinquished the more obnoxious tenets of Arcesilaüs, and restored, in some measure, the declining reputation of the Platonic school (see <ref type="cross" target="crossplato">Plato</ref>).</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀκαρνανία</foreign>). A western division of Greece, bounded on the north by the Ambracian Gulf, on the west and southwest by the Ionian Sea, on the northeast by Amphilochia, which is sometimes included in Acarnania, and on the east by Aetolia, from which, at a later time, it was separated by the Achelous. The name of Acarnania does not occur in Homer. In the most ancient times the land was inhabited by the Taphii, Teleboae, and Leleges, and subsequently by the Curetes. At a later time a colony from Argos, said to have been led by Acarnan, settled in the country. In the seventh century B.C. the Corinthians founded several towns on the coast. The Acarnanians first emerge from obscurity at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, B.C. 431. They were then a rude people, living by piracy and robbery, and they always remained behind the rest of the Greeks in civilization and refinement. They were good slingers, and are praised for their fidelity and courage. The different towns formed a league, which met at Stratus, and subsequently at Thyrium or Leucas.

<head orig="Achaean League">Achaean League</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="la">Achaĭcum Foedus</foreign>; <foreign lang="greek">τὸ Ἀχαϊκόν</foreign>). The league or confederation of a number of towns on the northwest coast of Peloponnesus. In speaking of it we must distinguish between two periods. The former, though formed for mutual protection, was mainly of a religious character, whereas the latter was a political confederation to protect the towns against the domination of Macedonia.</p>
 <p>(1) <title>The Earlier League.</title>—When the Heraclidae took possession of Peloponnesus, a portion of the Achaeans, under Tisamenos, turned northwards and took possession of the northern coast of the peninsula, which was called <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγιαλός</foreign>: the Ionians, who had hitherto occupied that country, sought refuge in Attica and on the west coast of Asia Minor. The country thus occupied by the Achaeans, from whom it derived its name of Achaia, contained twelve towns which had been leagued together even in the time of their Ionian inhabitants. They were governed by the descendants of Tisamenus, until, after the death of King Ogyges, they abolished the kingly rule and established democratic institutions. The time when this happened is not known. In the time of Herodotus (<bibl n="Hdt. 1.145" default="NO" valid="yes">i. 145</bibl>) <cb /> the twelve towns of which the league consisted were: Pellene, Aegeira, Aegae, Bura, Helicé, Aegion, Rhypes, Patrae, Pharae, Olenos, Dymé, and Tritaea. After the time of Herodotus, Rhypes and Aegae disappear from the number of the confederate towns, as they had decayed and become deserted (<bibl n="Paus.  7.23.25" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus. vii.23.25</bibl>; <bibl n="Strab.  8.7.5" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.viii. p. 387</bibl>), and Leontion and Cerynea stepped into their place (Polyb. ii. 41). Helicé appears to have been their common place of meeting; but this town, together with Bura, was swallowed up by the sea during an earthquake in B.C. 373, whereupon Aegion was chosen as the place of meeting for the confederates (<bibl n="Strab.  8.7.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Strab. viii. p. 384</bibl>). Of the constitution of this league very little is known; but it is clear that the bond which united the different towns was very loose, and less a political than a religious one. The looseness of the connection among the towns in a political point of view is evident from the fact that some of them acted occasionally quite independent of the rest (<bibl n="Thuc.  2. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.ii. 9</bibl>). The confederation generally kept aloof from the troubles of other parts of Greece, on which accordingly it exercised no particular influence down to the time when the league was broken up by the Macedonians. But they were nevertheless highly respected by the other Greek states on account of their honesty, sincerity, and wise moderation. Hence after the battle of Leuctra they were chosen to arbitrate between the Thebans and Lacedaemonians (Polyb. ii. 39). Demetrius, Cassander, and Antigonus Gonatas placed garrisons in some of their towns, while in others they favoured the rising of tyrants. The towns were thus separated from one another, and the whole confederation was gradually destroyed.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <title>The Later League.</title>—The ancient confederacy had thus ceased to exist for some time when events took place which in some towns roused the ancient spirit of independence. When in B.C. 281 Antigonus Gonatas attempted to drive Ptolemaeus Ceraunus from the throne of Macedonia, the Achaeans availed themselves of the opportunity of shaking off the Macedonian yoke, and renewing the old confederation. The object, however, was no longer a common worship, but a real political union among the towns. The places which first shook off the yoke of the oppressors were Dymé and Patrae, and the alliance concluded between them was speedily joined by the towns of Tritaea and Pharae (Polyb. ii. 41). One town after another expelled the Macedonian garrisons and tyrants; and when in B.C. 275, Aegion, the head of the ancient league, followed the example of the other towns, the foundation of the new confederation was complete, and the main principles of its constitution were settled, though afterwards many changes and modifications were introduced. The fundamental laws were that henceforth the confederacy should form one inseparable state; that every town which should join it should have equal rights with the others; and that all members in regard to foreign countries should be regarded as dependent, and be bound in every respect to obey the federal government and those officers who were intrusted with the executive (Polyb. ii. 37 foll.). No town, therefore, was allowed to treat with any foreign power without the sanction of the others. Aegion, for religious reasons, was appointed the seat of the government. At Aegion, therefore, the citizens of the various towns met at stated and regular times 
<pb n="9" /><cb /> to deliberate upon the common affairs of the confederation, and if necessary upon those of any separate town or even of individuals, and to elect the officers of the league. After having thus established a firm union among themselves, the Achaeans zealously exerted themselves in delivering other towns also from their tyrants and oppressors. The league, however, did not acquire any great strength until B.C. 251, when Aratus united Sicyon, his native place, with it, and some years later also gained Corinth for it. Megara, Troezen, and Epidaurus soon followed their example. Afterwards Aratus prevailed upon all the more important towns of Peloponnesus to join the confederacy, and Megalopolis, Argos, Hermioné, Phlius, and others were added to it. In a short time the league thus reached its highest power, for it embraced Athens, Aegina, Salamis, and the whole of Peloponnesus, with the exception of Sparta, Tegea, Orchomenus, Mantinea, and Elis. Greece seemed to revive, and promised to become stronger and more united than ever, but it soon showed that its new power was employed only in self-destruction and its own ruin. The Achaean League might at one time have become a great power, and might have united at least the whole of Peloponnesus into one State; but the original objects of the league were in the course of time so far forgotten that it sought the protection of those against whom it had been formed; and the perpetual discord among its members, the hostility of Sparta, the intrigues of the Romans, and the folly and rashness of the last strategy brought about not only the dissolution and destruction of the confederacy, but the political annihilation of the whole of Greece in the year B.C. 146. (Cf. Schorn, <title>Gesch. Griechenlands von der Entstehung des aetol. u. achaeischen Bundes</title>, p. 49 foll. and p. 60 foll.; Drumann, <title>Ideen zur Gesch. des Verfalls der griech.

<div2 id="crossachaei" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Achaei">Achaei</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαιοί</foreign>). One of the chief Hellenic races, and, according to tradition, descended from Achaeus, who was the son of Xuthus and Creüsa, and grandson of Hellen. The Achaei originally dwelt in Thessaly, and from thence migrated to Peloponnesus, the whole of which became subject to them with the exception of Arcadia, and the country afterwards called Achaea. As they were the ruling nation in Peloponnesus in the heroic times, Homer frequently gives the name of Achaei to the collective Greeks. On the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Heraclidae and the Dorians, eighty years after the Trojan War, many of the Achaei under Tisamenus, the son of Orestes, left their country and took possession of the northern coast of Peloponnesus, then inhabited by Ionians, whom they expelled from the country, which was henceforth called Achaea. The expelled Ionians migrated to Attica and Asia Minor. The Achaei settled in twelve cities: Pellené, Aegira, Aegae, Bura, Helicé, Aegium, Rhypae, Patrae, Pharae, Olenus, Dymé, and Tritaea. These twelve cities formed a league for mutual defence and protection. The Achaei had little influence in the affairs of Greece till the time of the successors of Alexander. In B.C. 281, the Achaei, who were then subject to the Macedonians, resolved to renew their ancient league for the purpose of shaking off the Macedonian yoke. This was the <cb /> origin of the celebrated <ref type="cross" target="crossachaean-league">Achaean League</ref> (q.v.), which did not, however, obtain much importance till B.C. 251, when Aratus united to it his native town, Sicyon. The example of Sicyon was followed by Corinth and many other towns in Greece, and the league soon became the chief political power in Greece.

 </p>
 <p>(5) The famous son of Peleus, king of Phthiotis in Thessaly, by Thetis, the sea-deity. According to Lycophron, Thetis became the mother of seven male children by Peleus, six of whom she threw into the fire, because they were not of the same nature with herself, and because the treatment she had received was unworthy of her rank as a goddess. The scholiast on Homer, however, states, that Thetis threw her children into the fire in order to ascertain whether they were mortal or not, the goddess supposing that the fire would consume what was mortal in their natures, while she would preserve what was immortal. The scholiast adds that six of her children perished by this harsh experiment, and that she had, in like manner, thrown the seventh, afterwards named Achilles, into the flames, when Peleus, having beheld the deed, rescued his offspring from this perilous situation. Tzetzes assigns a different motive to Thetis in the case of Achilles. He makes her to have been desirous of conferring immortality <cb /> upon him, and states that with this view she anointed him with ambrosia during the day, and threw him into fire at evening. Peleus, having discovered the goddess in the act of consigning his child to the flames, cried out with alarm, whereupon Thetis, abandoning the object she had in view, left the court of Peleus and rejoined the nymphs of the ocean. Dictys Cretensis makes Peleus to have rescued Achilles from the fire before any part of his body had been injured but the heel. What has thus far been stated in relation to Achilles, with the single exception of the names of his parents, Peleus and Thetis, is directly at variance with the authority of Homer, and must therefore be regarded as a mere postHomeric fable. Equally at variance with the account given by the bard is the more popular fiction that Thetis plunged her son into the waters of the Styx, and by that immersion rendered the whole of his body invulnerable, except the heel by which she held him. There are several passages in the <title>Iliad</title> which plainly show that the poet does not ascribe to Achilles the possession of any peculiar physical defence against danger.</p>
 <p>The care of his education and training was intrusted, according to the common authorities, to the centaur Chiron, and to Phoenix, son of Amyntor. Homer specifically mentions Phoenix as his first instructor. Those, however, who pay more regard in this case to the statements of other writers, make Chiron to have had charge of Achilles first, and to have fed him on the marrow of wild animals; according to Libanius, on that of lions. Calchas having predicted, when Achilles had attained the age of nine years, that Troy could not be taken without him, Thetis, well aware that her son, if he joined that expedition, was destined to perish, sent him disguised in female attire to the court of Lycomedes, king of the island of Scyros, for the purpose of being concealed there. At the court of Lycomedes, he received the name of Pyrrha (<foreign lang="greek">Πυρρά</foreign>, Rufa), from his golden locks, and became the father of Neoptolemus by Deïdamia, one of the monarch's daughters. In this state of concealment Achilles remained until discovered by Odysseus, who came to the island in the disguise of a travelling merchant. The chieftain of Ithaca offered, it seems, various articles of female attire for sale, and mingled with them some pieces of armor. On a sudden blast being given with a trumpet, Achilles discovered himself by seizing upon the arms. The young warrior then joined the army against Troy. This account, however, of the concealment of Achilles is contradicted by the express authority of Homer, who represents him as proceeding directly to the Trojan war from the court of his father. ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9. 439." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>ix. 439.</bibl>) The Greeks, having made good their landing on the shores of Troas, proved so superior to the enemy as to compel them to seek shelter within their walls. No sooner was this done than the Greeks were forced to turn their principal attention to the means of supporting their numerous forces. A part of the army was therefore sent to cultivate the rich vales of the Thracian Chersonesus, then abandoned by their inhabitants on account of the incursions of the barbarians from the interior. But the Grecian army, being weakened by this separation of its force, could no longer deter the Trojans from again taking the field, nor prevent succour and supplies from being sent into the city. Thus the 
<pb n="11" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00011">
<head orig="Priam before Achilles. (Relief by Thorwaldsen, Munich.)">Priam before Achilles. (Relief by Thorwaldsen, Munich.)</head>
</figure>
 siege was protracted to the length of ten years. During a great part of this time, Achilles was employed in lessening the resources of Priam by the reduction of the tributary cities of Asia Minor. With a fleet he ravaged the coasts of Mysia, made frequent disembarkations of his forces, and succeeded eventually in destroying eleven cities. Among the spoils of one, Achilles obtained the beautiful Briseïs, while, at the taking of Thebé, Chryseïs, the daughter of Chryses, a priest of Apollo at Chrysa, became the prize of Agamemnon. A pestilence shortly after appeared in the Grecian camp, and Calchas, encouraged by the proffered protection of Achilles, ventured to attribute it to Agamemnon's detention of the daughter of Chryses, whom her father had endeavored to ransom, but in vain. The monarch, although deeply offended, was compelled at last to surrender his captive; but, as an act of retaliation, and to testify his resentment, he deprived Achilles of Briseïs. Hence arose “the anger of the son of Peleus,” on which is based the action of the <title>Iliad.</title> Achilles, on his part, withdrew his forces from the contest, and neither prayers nor entreaties, nor direct offers of reconciliation, couched in the most tempting and flattering terms, could induce him to return to the field. The death of his friend Patroclus, however, by the hand of Hector, roused him at length to action and revenge, and a reconciliation having thereupon taken place between the two Grecian leaders, Briseïs was restored. As the arms of Achilles, having been worn by Patroclus, had become the prize of Hector, Hephaestus, at the request of Thetis, fabricated a suit of impenetrable armour for her son. Arrayed in this, Achilles took the field, and after a great slaughter of the Trojans, and a contest with the god of the Scamander, by whose waters he was nearly overwhelmed, he met Hector, chased him thrice around the walls of Troy, and finally slew him by the aid of Athené. According to Homer, Achilles dragged the corpse of Hector at his chariot-wheels thrice round the tomb of Patroclus, and from the language of the poet he would appear to have done this for several days in succession. Vergil, however, makes Achilles to have dragged the body of Hector twice round the walls of Troy. In this it is probable that the Roman poet followed one of the cyclic or else the tragic writers. The corpse of the Trojan hero was at last yielded up to the tears and supplications of Priam, who had come for that purpose to the tent of Achilles, and a truce was granted the Trojans for the performance of the funeral obsequies. Achilles did not long survive his illustrious opponent. According to the more generally received account, as it is given by <cb /> the scholiast on Lycophron, and also by Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius, Achilles, having become enamoured of Polyxena, the daughter of Priam, signified to the monarch that he would become his ally on condition of receiving her hand in marriage. Priam consented, and the parties having come for that purpose to the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, Achilles was treacherously slain by Paris, who had concealed himself there, being wounded by him with an arrow in the heel. The ashes of the hero were mingled in a golden urn with those of his friend Patroclus, and were said to repose at Sigaeum.

<div2 id="crossacropolis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Acropŏlis">Acropolis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκρόπολις</foreign>). In nearly all the cities of Greece, which were usually built upon a hill or 
<pb n="13" /><cb />
 some natural elevation, there was a kind of tower or citadel, reared upon the highest part, to which the name <foreign lang="greek">ἀκρόπολις</foreign> (upper town) was given. At Rome, the <ref type="cross" target="crosscapitolium">Capitolium</ref> (q.v.) was analogous in its purposes to the acropolis of Greek cities.</p>
 <p>The Acropolis of Athens was situated on a plateau of rock, about 200 feet in height, 1000 in breadth from east to west, and 460 in length from north to south. It was originally called Cecropia, after Cecrops, the ancestor of the Athenians, whose grave and shrine were shown on the spot. On the north side of the Acropolis was the Erechtheum, the common seat of worship of the ancient gods of Athens, Athené Polias, Hephaestus, Poseidon, and Erechtheus himself, who was said to have founded the sanctuary. His house was possibly northeast of the Erechtheum. Pisistratus, like the ancient kings, had his residence on the Acropolis, and may have added the stylobate to the temple of Athené recently identified, south of the Erechtheum. The walls of the fortress proper were destroyed in the Persian wars, 480 and 479 B.C., and restored by Cimon. But the wall surrounding the foot of the hill, called the Pelasgicon or Pelargicon, and supposed to be a relic of the oldest inhabitants, was left in ruins. Cimon also laid the foundation of a new temple of Athené on the south side of the hill. This temple was begun afresh and completed in the most splendid style by Pericles, and called the <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenon">Parthenon</ref> (q.v.). Pericles at the same time adorned the approach to the west side of the Acropolis with the glorious Propylaea, and began to rebuild the Erechtheum in magnificent style. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosserechtheum">Erechtheum</ref>; Propylaea.) There were several other sanctuaries on the Acropolis—that, for instance, of Artemis Brauronia, on the southeastern side of the Propylaea; the beautiful little temple of Athené Niké, to the southwest; and the Pandroseum, adjoining the temple of Erechtheus. There were many altars—that of Zeus Hypatos, for example—and countless statues, among them that of Athené Promachos, with votive offerings. Among the numerous grottos in the rock, <cb /> one on the north side was dedicated to Pan, another to Apollo.

<div2 id="crossacrosticha" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Acrostĭcha">Acrosticha</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκρόστιχα</foreign>). Acrostics, which were popular alike with the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. With the Hebrews, in acrostic poetry, the initial letters of the lines or stanzas are made to run over the letters of the alphabet in their order. Twelve Psalms in the Old Testament are so written, the most remarkable being the 119th. One of the most celebrated acrostics in Greek is that contained in the words <foreign lang="greek">Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Υιὸς Σωτήρ</foreign>, the initial letters of which spell <foreign lang="greek">ἰχθύς</foreign> (fish), whence to the word <foreign lang="greek">ἰχθύς</foreign> a mystical meaning was attached by the early Christians. The Romans borrowed acrostic poetry from the Greeks as early as the time of Ennius, who composed one ( <title>de Div.</title> ii. 111). At a later period inscriptional acrostics occur, one of which calls the reader's attention to its character with the line <title>Inspice, lector, primordia versiculorum</title> (Wilmanns, 592, 593). The arguments to the Plautine plays are in acrostic lines. When the last letters of the lines spell words, the verse is called <hi rend="italic">telestic;</hi> when letters in the middle of the lines do so, the verse is <hi rend="italic">mesostic.</hi> Combinations of acrostic and telestic are found in the <title>Corp. Inscript. Lat.</title> v. 1693; of acrostic, mesostic, and telestic, in Flavius Felix (about A.D. 500).

<head orig="Acroterium">Acroterium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκρωτήριον</foreign>). A word generally used in the plural, and signifying the extremity of anything. (1) In architecture it is the same as <seg lang="la">fastigium</seg> (q. v.), the sloping roof of a building, and also for the ornamental front or gable. A more usual meaning is the pedestals placed on the summit of a pediment to receive statues or other ornamental figures. There were three <seg lang="la">acroteria</seg>, one over each angle of the pediment.</p>
 <p>(2) The extremities of the prow of a vessel, which were usually taken from a conquered vessel as a mark of victory. Hence, the act of so doing is expressed by the verb <foreign lang="greek">ἀκρωτηριάζειν</foreign>.</p>

<div2 id="crossacta" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Acta">Acta</head>

 <p> (1) The public acts and orders of a Roman magistrate possessing the <seg lang="la">ius agendi cum populo</seg>, which, after the expiration of his office, were submitted to the Senate for approval or rejection ( <title>Iul.</title> 19, 23). After the death of Iulius Caesar, the triumvirs swore, and compelled all the other magistrates to swear (Dio , xlvii. 48), to observe and maintain all his acta (<seg lang="la">in acta iurare</seg>), and hence it became the custom on the accession of each emperor for the new monarch to swear to observe and respect all the acta of his predecessors from Iulius Caesar downwards, with the exception of those who had been branded with infamy after death, such as Nero and Domitian ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 4. 42" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iv. 42</bibl>; Dio , lvi. 33, etc.). The Senate also swore that it would recognize the validity of the acts of the new emperor. Every year all the magistrates upon entering office on the first of January swore approval of the acts of the reigning emperor (Dio , xlvii. 18; liii. 28;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xvi. 22</bibl>, with the excursus of Lipsius; Dio , lviii. 17; lx. 25).
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Acta Senātus</hi>, called also <hi rend="SmallCaps">Commentarii Senātus</hi> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15. 74" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xv. 74</bibl>) and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Acta Patrum</hi> ( <bibl n="Enn. Ann. 5. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ann.</title>v. 4</bibl>), containing an account of the various matters brought before the Senate, the opinions of the chief speakers, and the decision of the house. We may infer from a passage of Suetonius (<title>Iul.</title> 20.) that the proceedings of the Senate were not usually published till the first consulship of Iulius Caesar, B.C. 59; but under the direction of the presiding magistrate, assisted by certain senators appointed for the purpose, the decrees of the Senate had been written down and recorded in the Aerarium long previously, and the debates on the Catilinarian conspiracy had been widely circulated by Cicero ( <bibl n="Plut. Sull. 14" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Sull.</title>14</bibl><bibl n="Plut. Sull. 15" default="NO" valid="yes"> Sull., 15</bibl>) from notes taken by some friends of his among the senators. Iulius Caesar ordered that the proceedings of the Senate, which had been only occasionally published before, should henceforth be published regularly every day (<seg lang="la">senatus acta diurna</seg>) under the authority of the government, from the notes of shorthand writers ( <title>Mort. Claud.</title> 9). Augustus forbade the publication of the proceedings of the Senate, but they still continued to be preserved; and one of the senators, who received the title <seg lang="la">ab actis senatus</seg>, was chosen by the emperor to compile the account ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 5. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>v. 4</bibl>;  <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 3" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>3</bibl>; Orelli, <title>Inscr.</title> No. 2274, 3186). This office was generally held as an annual one, after the quaestorship ( <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Hadr. 3" default="NO">Spart. <title>Hadr.</title>3</bibl>), but before the praetorship or aedileship. The persons intrusted with this office must not be confounded with the various clerks (<seg lang="la">actuarii, servi publici, scribae;</seg> also the <seg lang="la">censuales</seg>), who were present in the Senate to take notes of its proceedings, and who were only excluded when the Senate passed a <seg lang="la">senatusconsultum tacitum;</seg> that is, when they deliberated on a subject of the greatest importance, respecting which secrecy was necessary or advisable (Capit. <title>Gord.</title> 12). It was doubtless from notes and papers of these clerks that the acta were compiled by the <cb /> senator, who was intrusted with this office. The acta were deposited in the imperial archives (<seg lang="la">tabularium</seg>) or in particular departments of the public libraries, to which access could only be obtained by the express permission of the <seg lang="la">praefectus urbi.</seg> They were consulted and are frequently referred to by the later historians (e. g. Vopisc. <title>Prob.</title> 2; Lamprid. <bibl n="Ael. Spart. Sever. 56" default="NO"> <title>Sever.</title>56</bibl>; Capitol. <title>Opil. Macr.</title> 6), and many extracts from them were published in the Acta Diurna.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Acta Diurna</hi>. A gazette published daily at Rome by the authority of the government during the later times of the Republic, and under the Empire, corresponding in some measure to our newspapers ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 3. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>iii. 3</bibl>; xiii. 31; xvi. 22). In addition to the title <title>Acta Diurna</title>, we find them referred to under the names <title>Diurna, Acta Publica, Acta Urbana, Acta Rerum Urbanarum, Acta Populi</title>, and they are frequently called simply <title>Acta.</title> The Greek writers on Roman history call them <foreign lang="greek">τὰ ὑπομνήματα, τὰ δημόσια ὑπομνήματα, τὰ δημόσια γράμματα</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">τὰ κοινὰ ὑπομνήματα</foreign>. The nature of their contents will be best seen from the following passage of Petronius (cap. 53), where an imitation of them is given by the <seg lang="la">actuarius</seg> of Trimalchio: “Actuarius—tanquam acta urbis recitavit: vii. Kal. Sextiles in praedio Cumano, quod est Trimalchionis, nati sunt pueri <hi rend="SmallCaps">xxx</hi>, puellae <hi rend="SmallCaps">xl;</hi> sublata in horreum ex area tritici millia modium quingenta; boves domiti quingenti. Eodem die Mithridates servus in crucem actus est, quia Gai nostri genio maledixerat. Eodem die in arcam relatum est, quod collocari non potuit, sestertium centies. Eodem die incendium factum est in hortis Pompeianis, ortum ex aedibus Nastae villici. . . . Iam etiam edicta aedilium recitabantur, et saltuariorum testamenta, quibus Trimalchio cum elogio exheredabatur; iam nomina villicorum et repudiata a circitore liberta in balneatoris contubernio deprehensa; atriensis Baias relegatus; iam reus factus dispensator; et iudicium inter cubicularios actum.” From this passage, and from the numerous passages in ancient writers in which the Acta Diurna are quoted (references to which are given by Hübner), it would appear that they usually contained the following matters: (1) The number of births and deaths in the city, an account of the money paid into the treasury from the provinces, and everything relating to the supply of corn. These particulars would be extracted from the <seg lang="la">tabulae publicae.</seg> By an ancient regulation, ascribed to Servius Tullius, all births were registered in the Temple of Venus, and all deaths in that of Libitina; and we know that this practice was continued under the Empire, only that at a later time the Temple of Saturn was substituted for that of Venus for the registration of births.</p>
 <p>(2) Extracts from the Acta Forensia, containing the edicts of magistrates, the testaments of distinguished men, reports of trials, with the names of those who were acquitted and condemned, and likewise a list of the magistrates who were elected.</p>
 <p>(3) Extracts from the Acta Senatus, especially all the decrees and acclamations (see <ref type="cross" target="crossacclamatio">Acclamatio</ref>) in honour of the reigning emperor.</p>
 <p>(4) A court circular, containing an account of the births, deaths, festivals, and movements of the imperial family.</p>
 <p>(5) Curious and interesting occurrences, such as prodigies and miracles, the erection of new edifices, the conflagration of buildings, funerals, sacrifices, a list of the various games, and especially amatory tales 
<pb n="15" /><cb />
 and adventures, with the names of the parties. (Cf. <title>Ad Fam.</title> ii. 15.) News of private affairs seems to have been communicated to the official editor by way of advertisement. (Cf. <bibl n="Quint.  9. 3" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.ix. 3</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  17" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 17</bibl>, where a widower speaks of himself as <seg lang="la">saucius pectus.</seg>) The fragments of some Acta Diurna have been published by Pighius and Dodwell, but their genuineness is more than doubtful. (Cf. Heinze, <title>De Spuriis Diurnorum Act. Fragmentis</title>, Greifswald, 1860.)</p>
 <p>It is certain that these acta were published under the authority of the government, but it is not stated under whose superintendence they were drawn up. It is probable, however, that this duty devolved upon the magistrates, who had the care of the <seg lang="la">tabulae publicae</seg>, namely, the censors under the Republic ( <bibl n="Liv.  4. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.iv. 8</bibl>; xliii. 16), and sometimes the quaestors, sometimes the <seg lang="la">praefecti aerarii</seg> under the Empire ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13. 28" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiii. 28</bibl>). The actual task of compiling them was committed to subordinate officers, called <seg lang="la">actuarii</seg> or <hi rend="italic">actarii</hi>, who were assisted by various clerks, and by reporters (<seg lang="la">notarii</seg>), who took down in shorthand the proceedings in the courts, etc. After the acta had been drawn up, they were exposed for a time in some public place in the city <seg lang="la">in albo</seg>, where persons could read them and take copies of them. Many scribes, whom Cicero speaks of under the name of <seg lang="la">operarii</seg>, made it their business to copy them or make extracts from them for the use of the wealthy in Rome, and especially in the provinces, where they were eagerly sought after and extensively read ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> viii. 1; xiii. 8;  <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xvi. 22</bibl>). After the acta had been exposed in public for a certain time, they were deposited, like the Acta Senatus, in some of the record offices or the public libraries.</p>
 <p>The style of the acta, as appears from the passage in Petronius, was very simple and concise. They contained a bare enumeration of facts, without any attempt at ornament.</p>
 <p>Hübner has proved against Becker (<title>Handbuch</title>, i. pp. 30 and 32) that these acta were first published in the first consulship of Iulius Caesar. Previous to this time it was common for a MS. chronicle of public events at Rome to be compiled by scribes, and forwarded along with private letters to friends at a distance ( <title>Ad Fam.</title> viii. 1, 2, 8, 11; ii. 8; xii. 22; xv. 6. Cf. Hübner, p. 39; Mommsen, <bibl n="Sal. Hist. 4. 606" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Hist.</title>iv. 606</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The Acta Diurna are last mentioned by Vopiscus (<title>Prob.</title> cap. 2), and probably continued in use to the downfall of the Western Empire. They were never published in Constantionople.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Acta Forensia</hi>. These were of two kinds. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) The Romans kept their private accounts with so much accuracy that their books (<seg lang="la">accepti et expensi</seg>), bonds (<seg lang="la">chirographa</seg>), and contracts (<seg lang="la">syngrapha</seg>) were admitted as legal evidence. Frequently witnesses (<seg lang="la">pararii</seg>,  <bibl n="Sen. Ben. 2. 23. 2" default="NO" valid="yes">Sen. <title>Ben.</title>ii. 23. 2</bibl>) were employed to establish their authenticity. At a later date notaries (<seg lang="la">tabelliones</seg>) who had offices (<seg lang="la">stationes</seg>) in the public streets drew up these documents, which were ratified by the signature (<seg lang="la">subscriptio</seg>) of the parties. A senatus consultum passed under Nero ( <bibl n="Suet. Ner. 17" default="NO">Suet. <title>Ner.</title>17</bibl>; <bibl n="Quint.  12. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint.xii. 8</bibl><bibl n="Quint.  13" default="NO" valid="yes">Quint., 13</bibl>; <title>Sent. Recept.</title> v. 25, 6) prescribed the legal form of such documents. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscodex-accepti-et-expensi">Codex Accepti et Expensi</ref>.</p>
 <p><title>(b) Acta iudiciorum</title> contained the record of all proceedings of the magistrates, alike in contentious and in non-contentious business. The latter included such matters as adoptions, <seg lang="la">cessio in iure</seg>, <cb /> manumissions, the appointment of guardians, and the like. Such magisterial functions could be discharged anywhere, even in the baths or in the streets (<title>Instit. Iust.</title> i. 5, 2). Under the Republic there is no evidence of the method of legal attestation in these cases; but under the Empire it was customary for the parties to have a formal statement drawn up by a public official (<seg lang="la">acta</seg> or <seg lang="la">gesta</seg>), and confirmed by the magistrate (<title>Instit. Iust.</title> i. 11, 2, and 12, 8). In the case of contentious business, so long as the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were in use, there was no need of a written record, for the <seg lang="la">litis contestatio</seg> was attested by witnesses. On the other hand, when <seg lang="la">formulae</seg> came into use, these were necessarily in writing, though the decision of the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> was given <seg lang="la">viva voce.</seg> There was a special form of action (<seg lang="la">iudicati actio</seg>) against a defendant who denied the existence of a decision given against him. There is evidence of the existence of a record (<title>acta, Fragm. Vat. Iur.</title> 112) under the Empire. The <seg lang="la">cognitiones extraordinariae</seg> increased the importance of this. But the existence of a written decision was not compulsory before the constitutions of Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian.
 </p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Acta Militaria</hi> contained an account of the duties, numbers, and expenses of each legion (Veg. ii. 19), and of the amount of property possessed by each soldier (<seg lang="la">peculium castrense</seg>). They were probably preserved among the official papers of the several legions. The soldiers who drew up these acta are frequently mentioned in inscriptions and ancient writers under various titles, as <seg lang="la">librarius legionis, actuarius</seg> or <seg lang="la">actarius legionis, tabularius casfrensis.</seg> (Cf.

<head orig="Actio">Actio</head>

 <p> In the widest sense, <seg lang="la">actio</seg> means right of action, and is nearly equivalent to <seg lang="la">ius</seg> in the sense of a private right. In the narrower and original sense, it means proceedings taken to enforce a right.</p>
 <p>(1) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">legis actiōnes</hi> were the forms of procedure proper to the old civil law. They were not all suits in the modern sense, i. e. they did not all imply the submission of the case to the judgment of a court: <seg lang="la">legis actio per pignoris capionem</seg>, the enforcement of a claim by distress, was wholly extrajudicial, and <seg lang="la">legis actio per manus iniectionem</seg>, enforcement of a claim by the arrest of the debtor, involved merely a formal recognition by the magistrate that the arrest was technically justified (<seg lang="la">addictio</seg>). The action by distress was admissible only in certain special and peculiar cases where sacral or public interests were involved (see Gaius , <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 26" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 26</bibl>-29), but the action by arrest was admissible wherever the defendant's right was technically clear, not only when judgment had actually been rendered—<seg lang="la">manus iniectio pro iudicato</seg>—but in other cases, e. g. against the nexal debtor (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossnexum">Nexum</ref>). In such cases the arrested debtor could not himself dispute the creditor's right: a <seg lang="la">vindex</seg> must intervene in his behalf, who, if defeated, became liable for twice the amount of the debt (<seg lang="la">duplum</seg>). In the later Republic, however, the debtor, if not <seg lang="la">iudicatus</seg>, was regularly permitted to dispute the arrest and act as his own <title>vindex (lex Vallia)</title>, so that arrest, except on a judgment-debt, became simply a method of opening a suit—<seg lang="la">manus iniectio pura.</seg> Cf. Gaius , <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 21" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 21</bibl>-25.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">legis actio sacramento</seg> (also <seg lang="la">sacramenti</seg> and <seg lang="la">per sacramentum</seg>), on the contrary, was from the outset a suit in the modern sense. It was the regular form of procedure (<seg lang="la">actio generalis</seg>) for obtaining a decision in a case of disputed right. (Cf. Gaius, <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 13" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 13</bibl>-17.) The plaintiff summoned the defendant to appear before the magistrate—<seg lang="la">in ius vocatio.</seg> If the latter refused to come he was treated as having confessed judgment, and the plaintiff might proceed to <seg lang="la">manus iniectio</seg>, a rule which insured prompt compliance with the plaintiff's summons. The litigants stated their case by the use of set and formal phrases, accompanied by ceremonial acts. The forms varied according to the nature of the suit. (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) If a property right is in dispute (<seg lang="la">actio in rem</seg>), the plaintiff asserted his right, and the defendant replied by a counter-assertion of right, the assertion in each case (and hence the action itself) being termed <seg lang="la">vindicatio.</seg> Cases of disputed right over wife or children, as over slaves, were treated as proceedings <seg lang="la">in rem</seg> (family rights not being distinguished from property <cb /> rights); but here the <seg lang="la">vindicatio</seg> of one of the parties might be <seg lang="la">in libertatem</seg>, i. e. he might assert that the person claimed as slave or child or wife was really free from <seg lang="la">potestas</seg> or <seg lang="la">manus.</seg> In all these vindicatory proceedings each party held a staff (<seg lang="la">fistuca</seg>), which, according to Gaius , represented a spear (<seg lang="la">quasi hastae loco</seg>), and the entire ritual suggested an impending appeal to the ordeal of battle. But at this point the magistrate enjoined peace, and the antagonists challenged each other to wager a certain sum (<seg lang="la">sacramentum</seg>, 50 or 500 <seg lang="la">asses</seg>, according to the value of the object in dispute) on the truth of their respective assertions. Each party presented sureties (<seg lang="la">praedes</seg>) for the payment of the sum wagered. The magistrate then <seg lang="la">dabat vindicias</seg>—i. e. assigned the person or thing in dispute to the custody of one of the litigants, who presented sureties for its redelivery in case sentence should be rendered against him. Where a question of liberty was at stake, ancient usage, confirmed by the Twelve Tables, assigned the custody of the person <seg lang="la">secundum libertatem</seg>, i. e. to the party asserting liberty (cf. the case of Virginia, <bibl n="Liv.  3. 44" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, 344</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 1, 2, 2. 24); and provided that in such cases the smaller <seg lang="la">sacramentum</seg> of 50 <seg lang="la">asses</seg> should always be employed. (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) It is probable that where <seg lang="la">manus iniectio</seg> had been initiated against a debtor and a <seg lang="la">vindex</seg> intervened, the latter used the forms of the <seg lang="la">vindicatio in libertatem;</seg> and Brinz conjectures that there was originally no other means of testing a question of debt by <seg lang="la">actio sacramento</seg> (Grünhut's <title>Zeitschr.</title> i. 23). But according to the ordinary opinion, based on Gaius , <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 13" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 13</bibl>-15<bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 20" default="NO" valid="yes"> Inst., 20</bibl>, and Valer. <title>De Iuris Not. Signif.</title> iv. 1, 2, the sacramental action ran <seg lang="la">in personam</seg>, for the recovery of a definite sum owed, whether on contract or by reason of tort, and without vindicatory forms, the plaintiff asserting and the defendant denying the debt, and each then challenging the other to the customary wager. In both cases, whether the action was <seg lang="la">in rem</seg> or <seg lang="la">in personam</seg>, the proceedings <seg lang="la">in iure</seg>, i. e. before the magistrate, closed up with <seg lang="la">litis contestatio</seg>, i. e. the calling in of witnesses to attest the issue raised by the pleadings; and the case was then sent for trial to a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> or body of <seg lang="la">iudices.</seg> These had only to find that the <seg lang="la">sacramentum</seg> of the one party was <seg lang="la">iustum</seg>, that of the other <seg lang="la">iniustum.</seg> The sum wagered by the defeated party fell into the public treasury.</p>
 <p>Another true suit was the <seg lang="la">legis actio per iudicis arbitrive postulationem</seg>, which opens with a direct request for the appointment of a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> or referee. This was probably the form of action used whenever the direct averment of a definite right was impossible, e. g. when the sum in dispute was uncertain, or when it was necessary to draw the line <cb />
 between opposing rights, e. g. to determine boundaries or to divide an inheritance.</p>
 <p>The latest of the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg>, established by a special statute (<title>lex Silia</title>) was that <seg lang="la">per condietionem</seg>, called also simply <seg lang="la">condictio.</seg> It was simpler in form than the <seg lang="la">actio sacramento;</seg> ran for the recovery of any definite sum of money (<seg lang="la">certa pecunia</seg>), and later (by a <title>lex Calpurnia</title>) of any definite object (<seg lang="la">omnis certa res</seg>); and provided roughly for the payment of damages to the victorious party, each antagonist promising the other at the beginning of the suit to pay a penalty of one-third of the amount in litigation in case the division went against him (<seg lang="la">stipulatio et restipulatio tertiae partis</seg>).</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were so called, according to Gaius , either because they were introduced by <seg lang="la">leges</seg> or because the pleadings were based upon the language of the <seg lang="la">leges</seg>, and were observed like laws ( <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 11" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 11</bibl>). The former explanation, at least, is untrue. All the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg>, except the <seg lang="la">condictio</seg>, are obviously older than the Twelve Tables. They were of customary origin, and the special forms employed were worked out by the <hi rend="italic">pontifices.</hi> This is particularly clear in the case of the <title>actio sacramento. Sacramentum</title> is properly an oath, not a wager; and it is clear that in the original form of this action a religious issue was raised for priestly decision by the opposition of the oaths of the two parties. Even after the Twelve Tables, the <hi rend="italic">pontifices</hi> controlled the forms of action, and all the details of procedure until <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 450, when a book of forms, drawn up by Appius Claudius Caecus, was published (<seg lang="la">populo traditus</seg>) by his client, the scribe Cn. Flavius. The law of civil pleadings then came to be known as <title>ius Flavianum</title> (<bibl n="Liv.  9. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 46</bibl>; <title>Dig.</title> 1, 2, 2. 5, 6). A century later Aelius Paetus Sext. published, in his <title>Tripertita</title>, the text of the Twelve Tables, the established pontifical <seg lang="la">interpretatio</seg>, and a revised formulary of actions (<title>ius Aelianum</title>).</p>
 <p><title>Procedure in Iudicio.</title>—The <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were really only forms of pleading. All that took place <seg lang="la">in iure</seg> before the magistrate served simply to define the issue. The actual trial of the suit took place before a special <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> selected by the parties or appointed by the magistrate, or before a standing body of elected <seg lang="la">iudices</seg>, where the case fell under the special competence of such a board (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosscentumviri">Centumviri</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossdecemviri">Decemviri</ref>). Proceedings <seg lang="la">in iudicio</seg> were minutely regulated by the Twelve Tables. The parties were to appear before noon of the day set for trial. In case of the absence of either, sentence was rendered in favour of the party present. Both parties appearing, each briefly stated his case (<seg lang="la">causae coiectio</seg>), and then each submitted a fuller argument (<seg lang="la">peroratio</seg>) with evidence. The decision had to be reached by sunset.</p>
 <p><title>Execution of Judgment.</title>—The <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> were not magistrates, and they could issue no commands. They simply expressed an opinion (<seg lang="la">sententia</seg>) on the issue submitted to them. If the <seg lang="la">sententia</seg> sustained the plaintiff's claim and the defendant failed to satisfy judgment within 30 days, the plaintiff (his right being now clear) proceeded to arrest the debtor (<seg lang="la">manus iniectio pro iudicato</seg>). If no <seg lang="la">vindex</seg> intervened the creditor held the debtor in chains for 60 days, leading him out <seg lang="la">in comitium</seg> on three successive market-days (<seg lang="la">trinis nundinis continuis</seg>) and proclaiming the amount of the judgment. After this, judgment being still unsatisfied, the debtor was sold into foreign slavery (<title>trans Tiberim</title>). If there were several creditors they might cut <cb /> him in pieces. This latter provision of the Twelve Tables, the ancients asserted, was never enforced; and some moderns have tried to explain it as referring to the estate, not the person, of the debtor. The right of selling the debtor was commuted, either by custom or law (<hi rend="italic">lex Poetilia?</hi>) into a right of holding him to work off the debt, and ultimately into a simple right of imprisonment.</p>
 <p>All the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were <seg lang="la">iuris civilis</seg>, and could not be brought by or against foreigners. Where the private rights of the latter were guaranteed by treaty a special form of action was provided for their protection—the <seg lang="la">recuperatio.</seg> As in the case of the civil actions, the preliminary pleadings took place before a magistrate, and the decision was referred to special judges called <seg lang="la">recuperatores.</seg></p>
 <p>For full description of the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg>, see Muirhead, <title>Roman Law</title>, pp. 181-235.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Praetorian Formula</hi>.—Towards the end of the Republic the <seg lang="la">legis actiones</seg> were almost wholly superseded by a new and freer system of pleading worked out by the praetors—the procedure by <seg lang="la">formula.</seg> It probably originated in the courts established for non-citizen subjects of Rome (<seg lang="la">peregrini dediticii</seg>), who could not proceed according to the <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg> of Rome, for they had no share in it; nor by their own civil laws, for they had lost these by the overthrow of their <seg lang="la">civitates;</seg> nor by <seg lang="la">recuperatio</seg>, for they enjoyed no treaty rights.</p>
 <p>In fact, there was for them no law save that which the Roman magistrates—the praetor of the Peregrini at Rome and the Roman governors in the provinces—saw fit to make for them. It therefore became usual for the magistrate, after hearing what the parties had to say, to send the case to a <seg lang="la">iudex</seg>, with instructions to investigate such and such allegations of the parties, and if the allegations of the plaintiff appeared true, and those of the defendant untrue, to condemn the defendant. The advantage of this freer form of procedure proved so great that it was extended by a <title>lex Aebutia</title> and two <title>leges Iuliae</title> (Gaius , <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 30" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 30</bibl>) to suits between Romans. It then became possible for the city praetor either to instruct the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> to decide according to the old civil law (<seg lang="la">formula in ius concepta</seg>) or according to the freer principles of the <seg lang="la">ius gentium</seg> (cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossius">Ius</ref>), in which case the <seg lang="la">formula</seg> was in <seg lang="la">factum concepta.</seg> The <seg lang="la">formula in factum concepta</seg> was thus in reality a law-making formula; it was the instrument by which the praetor carried through the reforms which were embodied in the edict. In proportion as the praetorian law came to be recognized as <seg lang="la">ius</seg>, this distinction faded; and in the earlier Empire <seg lang="la">actio in factum</seg> came to mean a special action, outside of the established forms (cf. below, <seg lang="la">actio utilis</seg>). The formula was always addressed in writing to the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg>, and was cast in hypothetical form. The essential allegations of the plaintiff—his statement of facts (<seg lang="la">demonstratio</seg>) and his assertion of right (<seg lang="la">intentio</seg>) — were set forth as supposititious; if they proved true, the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> was to condemn the defendant (<seg lang="la">condemnatio</seg>). If the defence consisted in a general denial, no mention of it was necessary in the formula; but if the defendant alleged special reasons why the plaintiff's claim could not be legally or equitably enforced, these were submitted to the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> in an <seg lang="la">exceptio.</seg> Counter-allegations by the plaintiff might also require mention (<seg lang="la">replicatio</seg>), and so on, possibly, to a <seg lang="la">triplicatio;</seg> the allegations of the plaintiff appearing regularly in the positive form, <seg lang="la">si, aut si, nec non</seg>, <cb /> etc., and those of the defendant in the negative, <seg lang="la">nisi, nec</seg>, etc. Where, as in partition suits, it was desirable that the referee should assign certain pieces of property to one or the other of the parties, a power to do this was inserted (<seg lang="la">adiudicatio</seg>). The praetorian formula was equally applicable to actions <seg lang="la">in rem</seg> and <seg lang="la">in personam.</seg> It always ran, indeed, for condemnation in money damages; but where the plaintiff was suing to recover property, the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> was empowered to advise restitution (<seg lang="la">arbitrium restituendi</seg>), and to condemn in exemplary damages if his advice was not obeyed. The written formula did away with the necessity of <seg lang="la">litis contestatio</seg> in the old sense, but the term was retained to designate the conclusion of proceedings <seg lang="la">in iure.</seg></p>
 <p>Procedure <seg lang="la">in iudicio</seg> remained substantially unchanged. Argument by professional advocates (<seg lang="la">oratores</seg>) became usual in important cases, and hearings might be continued from day to day. Execution of judgment still took place by the arrest and imprisonment of the debtor. Levy on the entire estate was introduced in cases of bankruptcy, but the seizure of single articles to satisfy judgment did not appear until the Imperial period. By voluntary <seg lang="la">cessio bonorum</seg> a debtor might escape the infamy which attached itself to forced bankruptcy, and by an oath of poverty (<seg lang="la">eiuratio bonae copiae</seg>) he freed himself from imprisonment.</p>
 <p>In spite of the development of the formula, the <seg lang="la">legis actio sacramento</seg> was employed in the Imperial period in two classes of cases: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) where the decision was to be rendered according to the <seg lang="la">ius civile</seg> and by the centumviral court (Gaius , <bibl n="Gaius  Inst. 4. 31" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Inst.</title>iv. 31</bibl>); (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) where a sham suit was employed for purposes of emancipation, adoption, etc. In the later Imperial period the use of <seg lang="la">legis actio</seg> was confined to this second class of cases, and the term came to mean the authority of a magistrate to preside over and legalize such transactions, being thus equivalent to <seg lang="la">iurisdictio voluntaria.</seg></p>
 <p>For fuller account of procedure by the <seg lang="la">formula</seg>, see Muirhead, <title>Roman Law</title>, pp. 357-377; Sohm, <title>Institutes</title>, pp. 163-212.
 </p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Iudicia Extraordinaria</hi>, characteristic of Roman precedence, both by <seg lang="la">legis actio</seg> and by <seg lang="la">formula</seg>, was the separation of <seg lang="la">ius</seg> and <seg lang="la">iudicium</seg>, i. e. of the pleadings and the actual trial. This <seg lang="la">ordo iudiciorum (privatorum)</seg>, which took the decision of the case out of the hands of the magistrate and placed it in those of a free and independent citizen, was regarded by the Romans of the Republic as one of the chief bulwarks of personal liberty. In the Empire this <seg lang="la">ordo iudiciorum</seg> was first undermined and then swept away. Procedure <seg lang="la">extra ordinem</seg>, where an imperial official hears the evidence as well as the pleadings and himself renders the decision, appeared at the beginning of the Imperial period, both in special cases where new remedies were granted, and for the more speedy decision of all sorts of cases. Later it became usual, even in the ordinary courts, to select persons attached to the court (assessors or advocates) for services as <seg lang="la">iudices</seg>, private citizens being excused from this duty. The presiding magistrate and those subaltern <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> hear the entire case together, both the pleadings and the evidence, and the <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> retire <seg lang="la">pro forma</seg> to render the decision.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">formula</seg> thus became unnecessary, the <seg lang="la">iudices</seg> having heard the pleadings. In other cases the hearing of pleadings and evidence was delegated <cb /> from the outset to a <seg lang="la">iudex.</seg> Constantine forbade such delegation when the magistrate was able to try the case himself. With this implied recognition of the power of the magistrate to render sentence, the distinction between <seg lang="la">ius</seg> and <seg lang="la">iudicium</seg> disappeared; and in the time of Justinian all <seg lang="la">iudicia</seg> were declared to be <seg lang="la">extraordinaria.</seg></p>
 <p><title>Execution</title> of judgment took place in the later Empire—<seg lang="la">manu militari</seg>, i. e. by officers of the court, and was always directed primarily against the estate and only in second instance against the person.
 </p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Classification of Actions</hi>.—Through all the periods of Roman procedure a sharp distinction was drawn between actions <seg lang="la">in rem</seg> or <seg lang="la">petitiones</seg>, which are based on some right in the thing and run against all who interfere with this right, and actions <seg lang="la">in personam</seg>, which run against a particular person and his legal successors by reason of something which he has done to bind himself (<seg lang="la">se obligare</seg>), e. g. his contract or tort (<seg lang="la">delictum</seg>) —actions which logically ran <seg lang="la">in personam</seg> only, but which were made to run <seg lang="la">in rem</seg> (e. g. <seg lang="la">actio quod metus causa</seg>) —were termed <title>actiones in rem scriptae. Actiones mixtae</title> were such as ran at the same time for recovery of property and of a penalty, or for the recovery of debt and penalty; but the same term was also applied to cases in which both parties might be regarded as being at once plaintiff and defendant, and in which either or both parties might be condemned (e. g. actions of partition). <title>Actio certa (condictio certi)</title> ran for the recovery of a definite object or sum; <seg lang="la">incerta</seg>, for unliquidated damages. <title>Actio directa</title> is the action which regularly arises from a contract or other legal act; possible counter-claims, growing out of the same transaction, are enforced by <title>actio contraria. Actio directa</title> was also used to designate an established and familiar form of action, in distinction from <seg lang="la">actio utilis</seg> or <seg lang="la">in factum</seg> (cf. the English “action on the case”), which is given where no established action lies—<seg lang="la">ad exemplum actionis directae.</seg> The relation of an adapted and widened action to the earlier and narrower remedy was often expressed by <seg lang="la">quasi</seg> (e. g. <title>actio Serviana, quasi-Serviana</title>); actions in which the <seg lang="la">iudex</seg> was instructed to decide what was due on grounds of general equity (<seg lang="la">ex fide bona</seg>) were called <seg lang="la">bona fide actiones</seg>, in distinction from <seg lang="la">actiones strictae</seg> or <title>stricti iuris. Actio civilis, legitima</title> was one that lay at <seg lang="la">ius civili</seg>; actions created by the praetors or aediles were termed <title>honorariae. Actiones temporales, temporariae</title>, were such as must be brought within a certain time after the right of action arose. All others were <seg lang="la">perpetuae.</seg> In the later Empire all actions were subject to limitation or prescription, but those which ran for thirty or more years were still termed <title>perpetuae. Actio popularis</title> was one in which any citizen might appear as plaintiff. Such actions were designed to secure some public interest. They resembled the ordinary (private) actions only in that the penalty recovered usually went in whole or in part to the plaintiff. <title>Actio praeiudicialis</title>, cf. <ref type="cross" target="crosspraeiudicium">Praeiudicium</ref>.</p>

<head orig="Actium">Actium</head>

 <p> (now La Punta). A promontory in Acarnania at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, off which Augustus gained his celebrated naval victory over Antony and Cleopatra , September 2d, B.C. 31. Here was a temple of Apollo Actiacus or Actius, where the festival Actia had been celebrated. Augustus revived the celebration as a quinquennial feast in honour of his victory, and built <ref type="cross" target="crossnicopolis">Nicopolis</ref> (q.v.) on the opposite shore.</p>
 <p>The battle of Actium is one of the decisive battles of the world's history, since the stake for which it was fought was nothing less than the lordship of the Roman Empire—that is, of the occidental world. The chances of battle were all in favour of Antony. His troops, encamped on one shore of the gulf, were largely superior to his rival's in both numbers and discipline. He had 100,000 infantry, as against the 80,000 of Octavian (Augustus), an equal force of cavalry (12,000); while his ships not only numbered 500—double the number that Octavian's admiral Agrippa commanded, but were much larger, heavier, and better provided with the engines then in use for <cb /> discharging missiles. It was, perhaps, this great preponderance of naval force which led Cleopatra , who accompanied Antony, to urge upon him the plan of letting the issue of the war rest upon a naval battle. She herself, with her sixty ships, formed a line behind that of the vessels of Antony. <figure id="fig.00016.2">

 <p>For a long time after the battle began, the light galleys of Octavian made little or no impression upon the massive ships that opposed them; but at last, by a skilful manoeuvre, Agrippa forced Antony to extend his line of battle. This done, Agrippa's ships succeeded in breaking through it and darting towards the vessels of Cleopatra. Alarmed at this, the Egyptian queen at once gave the signal for flight, and with her ships put hurriedly to sea. Antony, forgetful that the crisis of the battle had now arrived, recklessly sailed in pursuit of her, leaving his fleet to win or lose as best it might in his absence. Deserted by its commander, it still fought on, but with little heart, <figure id="fig.00016.3">

The troops of Antony were still encamped upon the promontory fronting the forces of Octavian; yet they did not at once give battle, but waited in the hope that their general would return.  Sevendays passed by, and when he failed to appear, after some hesitation, they surrendered to Octavian and accepted him as their commander, thus making him at a stroke the master of the world.

 <p>The annexed figures of needles and pins, chiefly taken from originals in bronze, vary in length from an inch and a half to about eight inches.</p>
 <p>Pins were made not only of metal, but also of wood, bone, and ivory. Their principal use was to assist in fastening the garments, and more particularly in dressing the hair.

Thus Hesychius applies the name to steel; Pollux to grains of native gold; and Dionysius Periegetes to what was probably fine crystals of quartz. In fact, the ancients knew diamonds, if at all, only in their unpolished state, by which such epithets as “all-resplendent” would scarcely have been suggested.

<head orig="Adoptio">Adoptio</head>

 <p> (1) At <hi rend="SmallCaps">Athens</hi> adoption (<foreign lang="greek">εἰσποίησις</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">θέσις</foreign>) took place either in the adopter's lifetime or by will; or again, if a man died childless and intestate, the state interfered to bring into his house the man next entitled by the Attic law of inheritance as heir and adoptive son, so that the race and the religious rites peculiar to it might not die out. None but the independent citizen of respectable character could adopt, and he only while he was as yet without male heirs. If there were daughters, one of them was usually betrothed to the adopted son, and the rest portioned off with dowries. If after that a male heir was born, he and the adopted had equal rights.
 </p>
 <p>(2) At <ref type="cross" target="crossroma">Rome</ref> there were two kinds of adoption, both requiring the adopter to be a male and childless: <seg lang="la">arrogatio</seg> and adoption proper. The former could only take place where the person to be adopted was independent (<seg lang="la">sui iuris</seg>), and his adopter had no prospect of male offspring; at the instance of the pontifex, and after full proof of admissibility, it had to be sanctioned by the Comitia Curiata. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomitia">Comitia</ref>.) Adoption proper applied to those still under paternal rule (<seg lang="la">patria potestas</seg>), the father selling his son by formal <seg lang="la">mancipatio</seg> (q. v). to the adopter, who then, the paternal power being thus abolished, claimed the son before the court as his own, and the father allowed him to be adjudged to him. By either transaction the person adopted passed completely over into the family and rank of the adopter, and naturally took his 
<pb n="19" /><cb />
 name in full, but with the addition of a second cognomen formed from his own former <seg lang="la">nomen gentile</seg> by the suffix -<seg lang="la">anus</seg>, e. g. Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (son of Lucius Aemilius Paulus). Women, too, could be adopted, but not arrogated; neither could they adopt. At the latter end of the Republic we find a testamentary adoption in existence, which at first likewise produced a change of name, but not of status.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄδραστος</foreign>). (1) Son of Talaüs of Argos. Being expelled from Argos by Amphiaraüs, he fled to Polybus, king of Sicyon, whom he succeeded on the throne of Sicyon, and instituted the Nemean games. Afterwards he became reconciled to Amphiaraüs, and returned to his kingdom of Argos. He married his two daughters Deïpylé and Argia, the former to Tydeus of Calydon, and the latter to Polynices of Thebes, both fugitives from their native countries. He then prepared to restore Polynices to Thebes, who had been expelled by his brother Eteocles, although <ref type="cross" target="crossamphiaraus">Amphiaraüs</ref> (q.v.) foretold that all who should engage in the war would perish, with the exception of Adrastus. Thus arose the celebrated war of the “Seven against Thebes,” in which Adrastus was joined by six other heroes, viz., Polynices, Tydeus, Amphiaraüs, Capaneus, Hippomedon, and Parthenopaeus. This war ended as unfortunately as Amphiaraüs had predicted, and Adrastus alone was saved by the swiftness of his horse Arion , the gift of Heracles. Ten years afterwards, Adrastus persuaded the six sons of the heroes who had fallen in the war to make a new attack upon Thebes, and Amphiaraüs now promised success. This war is known as the war of the Epigoni (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίγονοι</foreign>), or descendants. Thebes was taken and razed to the ground. The only Argive hero that fell in this war was Aegialeus, the son of Adrastus: the latter died of grief at Megara on his return to Argos, and was buried in the former city. The legends about Adrastus and the two wars against Thebes furnished ample materials for the epic as well as tragic poets of Greece.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of the Phrygian king Gordius, having unintentionally killed his brother, fled to Croesus, who received him kindly. While hunting, he accidentally killed Atys, the son of Croesus, and in despair put an end to his own life.

<head orig="Adulterium">Adulterium</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">μοιχεία</foreign>). Adultery. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. Among the Athenians, if a man caught another in the act of criminal intercourse with his wife, he might kill him, and the same law held with respect to a concubine (<foreign lang="greek">παλλακή</foreign>). Other punishment was likewise permitted. It appears that at Athens there was no adultery unless a married woman was concerned, and even then there was no adultery if the married woman was a prostitute or one engaged in selling anything in the agora. If the husband chose to bring suit against the adulterer, it was called <foreign lang="greek">μοιχείας γραφή</foreign>. If the adultery was proven, the husband could not condone the offence under penalty of <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossatimia">Atimia</ref>.) The adulteress was excluded from the temple, and if found there any one might treat her as he pleased, provided he did not kill or mutilate her.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The general usages at Rome appear to have been very similar to the Athenian. The Lex Iulia de Adulteriis, passed under Augustus, about B.C. 17, enacted them. By this law, if a husband kept his wife after an act of adultery was known to him, and let the adulterer off, he was guilty of the offence of <seg lang="la">lenocinium.</seg> The husband or father in whose power the adulteress was, had sixty days allowed for commencing proceedings against the wife, after which time any other person might prosecute. A woman convicted of adultery was mulcted in half of her dowry and the third part of her property (<seg lang="la">bona</seg>), and banished (<seg lang="la">relegata</seg>) to some desolate island, such as Seriphos, for instance. The adulterer was mulcted in half his property, and banished in like manner. This law did not inflict the punishment of death on either party; and in those instances under the emperors in which death was inflicted, it must be considered as an extraordinary punishment, and beyond the provisions of the Julian law.</p>
 <p>The Julian law permitted the father (both adoptive and natural) to kill the adulterer and adulteress in certain cases, as to which there were several nice distinctions established by the law. If the father killed only one of the parties, he brought himself within the penalties of the Cornelian law <seg lang="la">de sicariis.</seg> The husband might kill persons of a 
<pb n="20" /><cb />
 certain class, described in the law, whom he caught in the act of adultery with his wife; but he could not kill his wife. The husband, by the fifth chapter of the Julian law, could detain for twenty hours the adulterer whom he had caught in the act, for the purpose of calling in witnesses to prove the adultery. If the wife was divorced for adultery, the husband was entitled to retain part of the dowry. The husband might, if he pleased, take a sum of money from the adulterer by way of compensation, and detain him till he found sureties for the payment. If the alleged adulterer had been unjustly detained, he might bring an action against the husband; and if he gained his cause, he and his sureties were released. If he failed, the law required the sureties to deliver up the adulterer to the husband before the court, to do what he pleased with him, except that he was not to use a knife or dagger.

<div2 id="crossaediles" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aedīles">Aediles</head>

 <p> At Rome, two sets of magistrates, the Plebeian (<seg lang="la">aediles plebis</seg> or <seg lang="la">plebeii</seg>) and the Curule (<seg lang="la">aediles curules</seg>). (1) The two <hi rend="SmallCaps">Plebeian Aediles</hi> were appointed B.C. 494 at the same time with the creation of the tribuneship of the plebs, as servants of the tribunes, and at first probably nominated by them till 471, 
<pb n="21" /><cb />
 when, like them and under their presidency, they began to be elected by the whole body of the plebs. They took their name from the temple (<seg lang="la">aedes</seg>) of the plebeian goddess Ceres, in which their official archives were kept. Besides the custody of the <hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi>, and afterwards of the <seg lang="la">senatus consulta</seg>, it was their duty to make arrests at the bidding of the tribunes; to carry out the death-sentences which they passed, by hurling the criminal down from the Tarpeian Rock; to look after the importation of corn; to watch the traffic in the markets; and to organize and superintend the Plebeian and Roman Games. Like the tribunes, they could only be chosen from the body of the plebs, and wore no badge of office, not so much as the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta</seg>, even after they became an authority independent of the tribunes.</p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Curule Aediles</hi>, from B.C. 366, were taken at first from the patrician body alone, soon after from patricians and plebeians by turns, and lastly from either. Elected yearly in the Comitia Tributa under the presidency of a consul, they were, from the first, officers of the whole people, though low in rank; they sat in the <seg lang="la">sella curulis</seg>, from which they took their name, and wore as insignia the <seg lang="la">toga praetexta.</seg> As in rank, so in the extent of their powers, they stood above the plebeian aediles, being entitled to exercise civil jurisdiction in market business, where the latter could only impose a fine. The functions of the two were very much alike, comprising: (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the superintendence of trade in the market, where they had to test weights and measures and the quality of goods; to keep down the price of provisions, both by prohibitive measures especially against regraters of corn, and by the purchase and liberal distribution of food (<seg lang="la">cura annonae</seg>); and, as regards the money market, to prosecute those who transgressed the laws of usury; (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) the care of the streets and buildings within the city and the circuit of a mile outside, by cleansing, paving, and improving the streets, or stirring up those who were bound to do it; by seeing that the street traffic was unimpeded; by keeping in repair the temples, public buildings, and works, such as sewers and aqueducts, and seeing that these latter and the fire apparatus were in working order; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a superintendence of health and morals, including the inspection of baths, taverns, and brothels, and the putting-down of all that endangered public order and decency, e. g. games of hazard, breaches of sumptuary laws, introduction of foreign religions, etc.; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the exhibition of games (of which the Roman and Megalensian devolved on the curule, the Plebeian on the plebeian aediles), the supervision of festivities at the <title>feriae Latinae</title>, and at games given by private men. The cost of the games given by themselves they defrayed partly out of a sum set apart by the State, but utterly inadequate to the large demands of later times; partly out of the proceeds of fines which were also spent on public buildings, and partly out of their own resources. Thus the aedileship became an expensive luxury, and its enjoyment less and less accessible to men of moderate means. Ambitious men often spent incredible sums in getting up games to win the people's favour, with a view to higher honours, though the aedileship was not necessary as a stepping-stone to these. In Cicero's time the legal age for the curule aedileship was thirty-seven. From B.C. 366 their number was unchanged, till Caesar, in B.C. 44, added two more, the <cb /> plebeian <seg lang="la">aediles cereales</seg>, to whom alone the <seg lang="la">cura annonae</seg> and the management of the Ludi Cereales were intrusted. Under the Empire the office of aedile lost much in importance by some of its functions being handed over to separate officers, especially by the transference of its jurisdiction and its control of games to the praetors; and it fell into such contempt that even Augustus had to make a tenure of it, or the tribuneship, a condition of eligibility to the praetorship; and succeeding emperors often had to fill it by compulsion. In the third century A.D. it seems to have died out altogether.

He aided Heracles, according to the Doric legend, in his contest with the Lapithae, and received as a reward the territory from which they were driven. Aegimius is a conspicuous name among the founders of the Doric line, and mention is made by the ancient writers of an epic poem, entitled <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγίμιος</foreign>, which is ascribed by some to Hesiod, by others to Cecrops the Milesian. The posterity of Aegimius formed part of the expedition against the Peloponnesus, and the Doric institutions of Aegimius are spoken of by Pindar as forming the rule or model of government for the Doric race.

<div2 id="crossaegina" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aegīna">Aegina</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἴγινα</foreign>). (1) A daughter of the river Asopus, carried away by Zeus under the form of an eagle, from Phlius to the island of Oenoné. She gave her name to the island.</p>
 <p>(2) An island in the Sinus Saronicus, near the coast of Argolis. The earliest accounts given by the Greeks make it to have been originally uninhabited, and to have been called, while in this state, by the name of Oenoné; for such is evidently the meaning of the fable, which states that Zeus, in order to gratify Aeacus, who was alone there, changed a swarm of ants into men, and thus peopled the island (Pausan. ii, 29, and <bibl n="Apollod.  3. xii. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Apollod.iii. xii. 7</bibl>). It afterwards took the name of Aegina, from the daughter of the Asopus. But, whoever may have been the earliest settlers on the island, it is evident that its stony and unproductive soil must have driven them at an early period to engage in maritime affairs. Hence they are said to have been the first who coined money for the purpose of commerce, and <figure id="fig.00022">
<head orig="Temple of Aegina. (Restoration.)">Temple of Aegina. (Restoration.)</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="23" /><cb />
 used regular measures, a tradition which, though no doubt untrue, still points very clearly to their early commercial habits. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumismatics">Numismatics</ref>.) It is more than probable that their commercial relations caused the people of Aegina to be increased by colonies from abroad, and Strabo expressly mentions Cretans among the foreign inhabitants who had settled there. After the return of the Heraclidae, this island received a Dorian colony from Epidaurus (Pausan. ii. 29), and from this period the Dorians gradually gained the ascendency in it, until at last it became entirely Doric, both in language and form of government. Aegina, for a time, was the maritime rival of Athens, and the competition eventually terminated in open hostilities, in which the Athenians were only able to obtain advantages by the aid of the Corinthians, and by means of intestine divisions among their opponents ( <bibl n="Hdt.  8. 46" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.viii. 46</bibl>, and v. 83). When Darius sent deputies into Greece to demand earth and water, the people of Aegina, partly from hatred towards the Athenians, and partly from a wish to protect their extensive commerce along the coasts of the Persian monarchy, gave these tokens of submission ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 49" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 49</bibl>). For this conduct they were punished by the Spartans. In the war with Xerxes, therefore, they sided with their countrymen, and acted so brave a part in the battle of <figure id="fig.00023">
<head orig="West Pediment of the Temple of Aegina.">West Pediment of the Temple of Aegina.</head>

After the termination of the Persian war, however, the strength of Athens proved too great for them. Their fleet of seventy sail was annihilated in a sea-fight by Pericles, and many of the inhabitants were driven from the island, while the remainder were reduced to the condition of tributaries. The fugitives settled at Thyrea in Cynuria, under the protection of Sparta, and it was not until after the battle of Aegos-Potamos, and the fall of Athens, that they were able to regain possession of their native island ( <title>Hist. Gr.</title> ii. 2, 5). They never attained, however, to their former prosperity. The situation of Aegina made it subsequently a prize for each succeeding conqueror, until at last it totally disappeared from history. In modern times the island nearly retains its ancient name, being called Aegina or, with a slight corruption, Engia, and is often visited by travellers, being beautiful, fertile, and well cultivated. As far back as the time of Pausanias, the ancient city would appear to have been in ruins. That writer makes mention of some temples that were standing, and of the large theatre built after the model of that in Epidaurus. The most remarkable <cb /> remnant of antiquity which this island can boast of at the present day is the Temple of Pallas Athené, situated on a mount of the same name, about four hours' distance from the port, and which is supposed to be one of the most ancient temples in Greece, and one of the oldest specimens of the Doric style of architecture.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">αἰγίς</foreign>). The storm-cloud and thundercloud of Zeus, imagined in Homer as a shield forged by Hephaestus, blazing brightly and fringed with tassels of gold, and displaying in its centre the awe-inspiring Gorgon 's head. When Zeus shakes the aegis, it thunders and lightens, and horror and perdition fall upon those against whom it is lifted. It is borne not only by Zeus “the aegis-bearer,” but by his daughter Athené, and occasionally by Apollo. As the same word means a goat-skin, it was explained in later times as the skin of the goat <ref type="cross" target="crossamalthea">Amalthea</ref> (q.v.), which had suckled Zeus in his infancy. At the bidding of the oracle, he drew it over his thunder-shield in the contest with the Giants, and fastened on it the Gorgon 's head. When the aegis became a standing attribute of Athené, it was represented as a skin either shaggy or scaly, with a fringe of snakes and the Gorgon 's head in the middle, and either serving the goddess as a breastplate, or hanging behind to screen the back and shoulders, or fastened like a shield on the left arm.</p>

<div2 id="crossaegyptus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aegyptus">Aegyptus</head>

 <p> A country in the northeastern part of Africa; the modern Egypt. The name, in Greek <foreign lang="greek">Αἴγυπτος</foreign>, is perhaps a corruption of <title>Hakeptah</title> (City of Ptah), i. e. Memphis. Others explain it with less probability as formed from the Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">gup</foreign>, “to guard”=<hi rend="italic">âgupta</hi>, “guarded about.” In Coptic, as in hieroglyphs, it is called <title>Kemi</title> (Black Land) from the colour of the soil. The Jews styled it <title>Mazor</title>, “fortified,” or in the dual, to denote both Upper and Lower Egypt, <title>Mizraim.</title> This name is preserved in the modern Arabic <title>Misr</title>—a word applied by the Arabs both to the country and to its capital, Cairo.</p>
 <p>Aegyptus was bounded on the north by the Mediterranean; on the east by Palestine, Arabia Petraea, and the Red Sea; on the south by Aethiopia, the division between the two countries being at the First or Little Cataract of the Nile, close to Syené; and on the west by the Great Libyan Desert. From Syené the Nile flows due north for about 500 miles, through a valley whose average breadth is about seven miles, to a point some few miles below Memphis. Here the river divides into branches (seven in ancient times, but now only two), which flow through a low alluvial land, called, from its shape, the Delta, into the Mediterranean. The whole district thus described is periodically laid under water by the overflowing of the Nile from April to October. The river, in subsiding, leaves behind a rich deposit of fine mud, which forms the soil of Egypt. All beyond the reach of the inundation is rock or sand. Hence Egypt was called the “Gift of the Nile.” The outlying portions of ancient Egypt consisted of three cultivable valleys (called oases), in the midst of the Western or Libyan Desert.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Ethnology and Civilization</hi>.—At the earliest period of which any record has been preserved, Egypt possessed a very high degree of civilization, and one which presupposes many centuries of development. It was the home, too, of a very large population, since during the Fourth Dynasty (about 3600 B.C.) some 100,000 men were employed in constructing the Great Pyramid. At the time of Nero (A.D. 54) the Egyptians numbered 7,800,000; and the population is estimated to have been not much less under the Pharaohs, at which time the towns numbered 1800 as against 3000 under the Ptolemies. The population of modern Egypt Proper in 1882 was 6,806,000. The ancient Egyptians appear to have been of mixed origin, partly Asiatic and partly Nigritic, superimposed upon an aboriginal type, copper-coloured, with high cheek-bones, large lips, thin legs, and large feet. Both these types appear upon the monuments. It is not true, as 
<pb n="25" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00025">
<head orig="Egypt under the Romans.">Egypt under the Romans.</head>
</figure>
 stated by the Greek writers, that a caste system prevailed.</p>
 <p>As to the knowledge and culture of the ancient Egyptians, it is sufficient to mention certain interesting and significant facts. As early as 4000 B.C., the pyramid-builders possessed a definite system of chronology, a decimal system of numbers, a knowledge of geographical science, of geometry, of astronomy, and probably of chemistry, anatomy, and medicine. Literature dates equally far back, since of this period fragments of the so-called Hermetic Books have come down to us; while <ref type="cross" target="crosscheops">Cheops</ref> (q.v.) himself was numbered among the authors of Egypt. Architecture and sculpture had attained an extraordinary development, as shown by the remarkably fine specimens of masonry still existing, by the admirably scientific construction of the temples, the elegance of the columns, the chiselled statues of Chephren, and the sculptures found at Meydoun. Egyptian art was rigidly conventional, yet its remains show unusual plastic <cb /> skill; and in the later centuries, when a freer treatment obtained, the lions and sphinxes evince <figure id="fig.00025.2">
<head orig="Head of Wooden Statue from Bûlak.">Head of Wooden Statue from Bulak.</head>
</figure> 
<pb n="26" /><cb />
 much spirit and vigour of execution. The architectural details of the temples were always coloured. <figure id="fig.00026">
<head orig="Ancient Profiles (from the Monuments): 1. Egypto-Ethiopian (the Tirhake of Scripture); 2, 4. Ethiopian; 3. Egyptian.">Ancient Profiles (from the Monuments): 1. Egypto-Ethiopian (the Tirhake of Scripture); 2, 4. Ethiopian; 3. Egyptian.</head>
</figure> In architecture the vault or arch was known at least 800 years before it can be shown to have been used by the Romans. To transport the huge blocks of stone found in Egyptian structures involved an advanced knowledge of engineering. The mechanical arts also flourished, and many inventions, often regarded as modern, had been made as early as the Fifth Dynasty. The blow-pipe, bellows, and siphons, the saw, chisel, press, balance, harpoon, lever, plough, and adze, were all employed. Razors appear during the Twelfth Dynasty. An opaque kind of glass was made about 3500 B.C., and dated specimens of the reign of Thothmes III. exist. At the same period the potter's wheel and the kiln were known, as well as applications of metallurgy and the use of tin.</p>
 <p>Music was cultivated, for the harp and flute were known in the Fourth Dynasty; and later are found the heptachord, pentachord, lyres, drums, trumpets, guitars, and the national instrument, the <ref type="cross" target="crosssistrum">sistrum</ref> (q.v.). Many of these instruments were of considerable size.</p>
 <p>Painting was almost as conventional as architecture and sculpture, the colours generally being the primary ones on a white background. The papyri containing rituals often exhibit illuminations like those of the mediaeval missals. Frescoes were not unknown; encaustic is found to date back to only a comparatively late period.</p>
 <p>In warfare, the Egyptians used shields, cuirasses of leather, helmets, bows, spears, clubs, swords, and axes. In conducting sieges, they employed the <seg lang="la">testudo</seg> (q. v.) and scaling-ladders, and appear to have had a knowledge of the principles of mining and counter-mining. Under the Eighteenth Dynasty, war-chariots were introduced, prior to which time the army was composed entirely of infantry. Sea-going vessels were not earlier than B.C. 2500, though galleys and <cb /> small sailing craft plied on the Nile at a very early period.</p>
 <p>Coined money was first introduced by the Persians, previous to which time it is possible that gold circulated in rings or in portions of definite weight. Popular amusements were fencing, juggling, dancing, dice, and bull-fighting.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Religion</hi>.—The religion of the ancient Egyptians was a pantheistic system, each god, as with the Romans, standing for some special attribute. Each principal divinity is accompanied by a <hi rend="italic">put</hi>, <figure id="fig.00026.2">
<head orig="Siphons used by the Egyptians.">Siphons used by the Egyptians.</head>
</figure> or retinue of associated gods. As with the Assyrians, the pantheon is grouped in triads, or family groups, each consisting of the parent deity, his wife and sister, and a son. Thus the god Ptah forms a triad with Sekhet or Bast and Imhotep. These triads are often associated with inferior deities to complete the <hi rend="italic">put.</hi> The worship of many triads was restricted to particular localities; but other triads, such as those of Osiris, Isis, and Horus (all of which see), were adored all over Egypt. The dual conception that embodies the antagonism of good and evil is seen in the opposition of the sun gods to the Great Serpent, Apap, the type of darkness; while Osiris is pitted against Set. On the monuments the gods are generally represented with human bodies but the heads of animals, animals being their living emblems. At the close <figure id="fig.00026.3">

 of the eighteenth dynasty, some foreign deities were admitted into the religious system of Egypt. Among these were Bar (Baal), Ashtarata (Ashtaroth), Ken (Kuin), and Reshpu (Reseph). As with the Greeks and Romans, so with the Egyptians, the gods were conceived as possessed of all the human passions and emotions.</p>
 <p>The chief of the Egyptian deities is Ptah, the Opener, the creator of all things, the same as the Phoenician Pataikos. To him belong Sekhet, the Lioness, Bast, Bubastis, the goddess of fire, identified with Artemis. Ptah is depicted as a bowlegged dwarf. His son, Nefer-Tum, wears the lotus on his head. Other gods are Khnum, the ramheaded god of water; Heka, the Frog; Sati, the Sunbeam; Nit, the Shuttle; Khons (Force), the Heracles of Egyptian mythology; Ra, the Sun; Amenra, the hidden power of the Sun; Seb, Time; and Nut, the Firmament. Seb and Nut (Cronos and Rhea) gave birth to Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Set, and the elder Horus. The myth of <ref type="cross" target="crossosiris">Osiris</ref> (q.v.) was the Egyptian type of the judgment and future destiny of man; and all the dead are called by his name. Each deity had its sacred animal, which was regarded as the second life of the deity whom it represented. The most famous of these animals was the Apis, or sacred bull, at Memphis, whose worship was national. See <ref type="cross" target="crossapis">Apis</ref>.</p>
 <p>Another point of the Egyptian religion was a <figure id="fig.00027.2">
<head orig="Temple of Thothmes III. at Karnak.">Temple of Thothmes III. at Karnak.</head>
</figure> <cb /> belief in the transmigration of souls. All who were too impure to be admitted to the Courts of the Sun, or whose bodies when embalmed perished before the end of 3000 years, passed from body to body, having first descended to the lower world. The Sacred Bark in which the mummy was carried over the Nile to its tomb was a type of the Sunboat which would at last bear the purified spirit to Paradise.</p>
 <p>The chief remains of Egyptian architecture are religious—tombs, temples, and pyramids—the last-named being royal tombs reared to mark the burial-places of the kings. They are the most ancient of the Egyptian monuments, the next in point of antiquity being the rock-tombs of the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties, with their mummy-pits. Later still come the hill-tombs, with a temple before them.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Government</hi>.—Ecclesiastical government was in the hands of the high-priests, in conjunction with an inferior hierarchy, overseers, and superintendents of revenues, domains, and gifts. The civil government was carried on by the royal secretaries <figure id="fig.00027.3">
<head orig="Bronze Figure of Apis.">Bronze Figure of Apis.</head>
</figure> of justice, finance, foreign affairs, and internal administration. The army—at one time numbering some 400,000 men—was officered by nomarchs, colonels, and captains. In the time of Rameses II. there were territorial regiments. Circuit judges administered law.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—In the third century B.C., <ref type="cross" target="crossmanetho">Manetho</ref> (q.v.), a priest of Heliopolis, prepared, at the request of King Ptolemy Philadelphus, a history of Egypt from Menes (B.C. 4455) to the conquest of Egypt by Alexander, B.C. 332, a period which he divided into thirty dynasties. The work of Manetho is preserved in the form of epitomes by Iulius Africanus (A.D. 300), Ensebius (q. v.), and Georgius Syncellus (A.D. 800). Much weight is now given to the statements of Manetho, since he undoubtedly had access to the most authentic records of Egypt; and the study of the monumental inscriptions in modern times has served to justify this confidence.</p>
 <p>Myth declares Egypt to have been originally governed by a dynasty of divinities—Ptah, Ra, Shu, Seb, Hesiri (Osiris), Set, and Har (Horus)— reigning 13,900 years, and succeeded by demigods who ruled for a further

</figure> whose epoch is variously dated by different Egyptologists. Brugsch fixes it at B.C. 4455, and Lepsius at B.C. 3892. No monuments of Menes exist. The seat of his power is said to have been This, near Abydos, and he is believed to have founded Memphis. His dynasty reigned some 250 years, being succeeded by the Second Dynasty, which held sway for 300 years. Under it the worship of sacred animals is asserted to have begun. With the succeeding dynasty (B.C. 3966 according to Brugsch) the monumental history of Egypt commences. The king Senoferu conquered the Sinaitic peninsula and opened the copper-mines of Wady-Maghâra, where his name and portrait may still be seen. The seated figures of Rahotep and his wife Nefert, the oldest statues in the world, date from this reign.</p>
 <p>The Fourth Dynasty lasted 167 years (B.C. 3733-3566). Under it Khufu (Cheops) built the Great Pyramid at Gîzeh; his successor Khafra (Chephrenes) built the second pyramid; and Menkaura (Mycerinus) the third. From this period dates also the famous ritual known as the Book of the Dead, and various works of art.</p>
 <p>The Fifth Dynasty comprised nine kings, and lasted some 200 years. The last of the line, Unas, built the truncated pyramid near Sakkara, now called Pharaoh's Seat. See <ref type="cross" target="crosspyramis">Pyramis</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Sixth Dynasty contains the name of King Pepi, whose general, Una, undertook various wars and expeditions, among them one to Palestine, in which he used negro troops from Nubia. A number of texts belonging to this reign were found in pyramids opened in 1880. It is doubtful whether Queen <ref type="cross" target="crossnitocris">Nitocris</ref> (q.v.), whom Manetho assigns to this dynasty, is an historical personage. Of her, <figure id="fig.00028.2">
<head orig="Hieratic Papyrus. (Twentieth Dynasty.)">Hieratic Papyrus. (Twentieth Dynasty.)</head>
</figure> <cb /> Herodotus relates various interesting stories, and the Arabs believe that she still haunts the third pyramid of Gîzeh, where she is said to have been buried.</p>
 <p>From the Seventh to the Twelfth Dynasty, Egyptian history is obscure. One reason, perhaps, is to be found in the fact that the nomarchs or local governors became more and more independent, to the detriment of the importance of the kings. The inscriptions at Siat, recently published by Griffith, show that in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties, the kings of Egypt waged war against these rebellious nomarchs, especially those of Thebes. These last, under the Tenth Dynasty, began to claim the title of royalty, and did in fact succeed in establishing their claim. More than that, they overran and conquered the whole country after a protracted struggle, so that the Eleventh Dynasty is Theban. Thebes, from being an insignificant provincial town, became the royal capital; and from the time of the Twelfth Dynasty (about B.C. 2500) begins a new period of political unity and intellectual achievement, so that in later times it was regarded as Egypt's Golden Age. Literature flourished, and great material prosperity prevailed. Nubia was conquered as far as the Second Cataract. Besides Thebes, other cities, such as On (Heliopolis), Tanis, and Bubastis, were embellished and enlarged; while the province of Fayûm was gained for agriculture. The excavations of Petrie prove that Amenemhat III. was the Moiris of Herodotus who constructed a great basin for a branch of the Nile flowing into that oasis and losing itself in swamps. In the middle of the basin were found two pyramids with colossal statues surmounting them; and near by, the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved. See <ref type="cross" target="crosslabyrinthus">Labyrinthus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Between the Thirteenth and the Eighteenth Dynasties there exists a blank. About B.C. 2000, the progress of the kings of Chaldea in Asia, or some other disturbance, sent the Hyksos or “Shepherd Kings” into Lower Egypt. These invaders appear to have been of Tartar race. They carried Memphis by storm, expelled the Theban dynasty, and made the city of Avaris (the later Tanis) their seat. Of these kings, Joseph was probably prime-minister to Apepi at Tanis. His granaries are still visible at Pithom. The Hyksos made some religious changes and tried to replace the worship of Ra by that of Set. They were finally overthrown by the Egyptians of Upper Egypt under Aahmes I. (Amosis), who took Avaris by assault and restored the old religion. The succeeding kings, Amenhotep I., Thothmes I., Thothmes II., and Thothmes III., carried the arms of Egypt far into Ethiopia, Nubia, and Asia, subduing the whole of Syria and part of Mesopotamia. The reign of Thothmes III. is the most brilliant period of Egyptian 
<pb n="29" /><cb />
 history. To him, Kush and the southern tribes of Ethiopia, the islands, as well as Assyria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, and a good part of Central Asia, paid tribute. Under Amenhotep IV., the capital was removed to Alabastron (Tel-el-Amârina), and the monotheistic worship of the sun was allowed to diminish the regard paid to the other deities. The true religion was restored by Haremhebi (Horus) after a period of some thirty-five years. He was succeeded by Rameses I., who heads a long dynasty. His successor, Seti I. (Sethos), by his victories in Asia, introduced the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth into Egypt. His troops garrisoned Tyre, and Aradus, and Bethanath in Canaan. Rameses II., son of Seti, defeated the Hittites and took Shaluma, the ancient site of Jerusalem, in a war which lasted four years. A tablet of this monarch has been found near Beyrût in Syria. Rameses II. also reconquered Ethiopia, which had revolted, and established a fleet on the Mediterranean. He it is whose exploits form a basis for the myths woven around the legendary <ref type="cross" target="crosssesostris">Sesostris</ref> (q.v.). His date is about B.C. 1322. His son Meneptah transferred the seat of government to Memphis, and is probably the Pharaoh of the Jewish Exodus.</p>
 <p>Rameses III., of the Twentieth Dynasty, waged war with the Philistines, and with some of the maritime tribes of Greece, gaining naval victories in the Mediterranean. His favourite temple and palace were at Medinet Habu. The Ramessids who followed were ended by the high-priests of Thebes, who deposed the last king. A new dynasty from Tanis succeeded, and reigned with little power. Under them, the police ceased trying to protect the tombs of the kings from plunderers, who, in consequence, stole many of the mummies and hid them in an excavation, where they were found in 1881. <figure id="fig.00029">

 <p>The Twenty-second Dynasty (B.C. 950) was of Libyan origin, probably established by the powerful Libyan body-guard which had become extremely influential. Shoshank I. (the Biblical Shishak) plundered cities in India, and made war upon the Jewish kings Jeroboam and Rehoboam. Under the Twenty-third Dynasty (of Tanis), the unity of the Empire was lost. The different provinces fell away from the central power, and in the Twenty-fourth Dynasty King Bocchoris ruled over Saïs and Memphis alone. Under the Twentyfifth Dynasty (B.C. 728), the whole of Egypt became an Ethiopian province, and its viceking suffered defeat at the hands of the Assyrians, who, in B.C. 671, under Assar-haddon, conquered Egypt and divided it among tributary princes. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossassyria">Assyria</ref>.) Many of the Assyrian garrisons were driven out in B.C. 668, and when the Assyrian empire began to decline, Psametik (Psammetichus) of Saïs, descended from the kings of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty, founded a new line with the aid of Greek mercenaries from Ionia and Caria. Under him and his successors, art and learning revived. His successor, Nekao II., began a canal to connect the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, but desisted at the warning of an oracle, having also lost a large number of workmen in the attempt. He it was 
<pb n="30" /><cb />
 who defeated Josiah, king of Judah, and conquered Palestine, but was himself defeated by Nebuchadnezzar. In the time of his reign, navigators from Phoenicia first sailed south of the equator. Psammetichus II. warred with the Ethiopians, and was followed by Apries, who was deposed and strangled by <ref type="cross" target="crossamasis">Amasis</ref> (q.v.), who reigned after him and fostered intercourse with Greece, marrying a Greek wife. He conquered Cyprus, but incurred the enmity of <ref type="cross" target="crosscambyses">Cambyses</ref> (q.v.), second king of the Medes and Persians, who invaded Egypt, and overthrew the son of Amasis at the battle of Pelusium (B.C. 527), thus insuring the conquest of Egypt, which now became a Persian province. Becoming insane, Cambyses committed many barbarous acts, stabbed the sacred bull Apis, and gave himself up to gross debauchery. He was succeeded by Darius I., Xerxes I., and Artaxerxes I., who governed with comparative mildness, but against whom the Egyptians rose in unsuccessful revolt, being aided by the Athenians. The Twenty-eighth (Saïte) Dynasty struggled with varying success against the Persians; the Twenty-ninth maintained a Greek alliance with the same object; but with the Thirtieth, the Persians finally prevailed, and Egypt remained subject to them until the time of Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), who in that year founded <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandria">Alexandria</ref> (q.v.), after having conquered Persia. In B.C. 306, Alexander's general, Ptolemaeus, assumed the title of King of Egypt. His successors transformed Egypt into a Greek kingdom, both the language of the government and of scholarship being Greek. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossalexandrian-school">Alexandrian School</ref>.) The court of the Ptolemies became a centre of learning; and Ptolemy Philadelphus built the famous Museum, founded the great Library, and procured the Septuagint translations of the Hebrew Scriptures. From this time the list of his successors is as follows: Euergetes (246-221 B.C.); Philopator (221-204 B.C.), who persecuted the Jews and warred with Antiochus; Epiphanes (204-180 B.C.); Philometor (180-145 B.C.); Euergetes II. (145-116 B.C.); Ptolemy Soter II. and his mother Cleopatra (116- 81 B.C.); Alexander II., BerenicCleopatra é (81-80 B.C.); Neos Dionysus (80-51 B.C.). Last came the famous <ref type="cross" target="crosscleopatra">Cleopatra</ref> (q.v.), the mistress of Antony. After her defeat at the battle of Actium (31 B.C.), Egypt was made a Roman province by Augustus Caesar, under a governor of equestrian rank. See <ref type="cross" target="crossptolemaeus">Ptolemaeus</ref>.</p>
 <p>Egypt remained peaceful under Roman rule, except for the conquest of Zenobia (270 A.D.) and the revolt of Firmus (272 A.D.). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosszenobia">Zenobia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossfirmus">Firmus</ref>.) The most interesting events of this period are, besides the two just mentioned, the visits of Vespasian, Hadrian, and Caracalla to Alexandria; the persecutions of <ref type="cross" target="crossdiocletian">Diocletian</ref> (q.v.); the rise of the Gnostics, Manichaeans, and Arians; and the final supremacy of the Christian faith in 379 A.D.</p>
 <p>When the Roman Empire was divided in 395 A.D., Egypt went with the Eastern division, and later became one of the great patriarchates of the Church. In 616 A.D., owing to bitter religious feuds, it became a Persian province for twelve years. In the year 639, when the Arabs invaded the country, a native (Coptic) governor was over Egypt, administering it in the name of the Emperor Heraclius. Seeing in the invasion a means for throwing off the rule of the Greeks, he made only a pretended resistance to the Arab chief, 'Amr Ibn el-Asi, <cb /> who in the year 641 took Alexandria, and made the whole of Egypt a province of the calif Omar.</p>

At first he took no part in the Trojan war; and it was not till Achilles attacked him on Mount Ida, and drove away his flocks, that he led his Dardanians against the Greeks.

</figure> saved in battle by the gods; Aphrodité carried him off when he was wounded by Diomedes, and Poseidon saved him when he was on the point of perishing by the hands of Achilles. Homer makes no allusion to the emigration of Aeneas after the capture of Troy, but, on the contrary, he evidently conceives Aeneas and his descendants as reigning at Troy after the extinction of the house of Priam; but later narratives relate that after the capture of Troy Aeneas withdrew to Mount Ida with his friends and the images of the gods, especially that of Pallas (<title>Palladium</title>); and that from thence he crossed over to Europe, and finally settled at Latium in Italy where he became the ancestral hero of the Romans. A description of the wanderings of Aeneas before he reached Latium is given by Vergil <cb /> in his <title>Aeneid</title> (bks. ii.-vi.). After visiting Epirus and Sicily, he was driven by a storm on the coast of Africa, where he met with <ref type="cross" target="crossdido">Dido</ref> (q.v.). He then sailed to Latium, where he was hospitably received by Latinus, king of the Aborigines. Here Aeneas founded the town of Lavinium, called after Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, whom he married. Turnus, to whom Lavinia had been betrothed, made war against Latinus and Aeneas. Latinus fell in the first battle, and Turnus was subsequently slain by Aeneas; whereupon, after the death of Latinus, Aeneas became sole ruler of the Aborigines and Trojans, and both nations were united into one. Soon after this Aeneas fell in battle against the Rutulians, who were assisted by Mezentius, king of the Etruscans. As his body was not found after the battle, it was believed that it had been carried up to heaven, or that he had perished in the river Numicius. The Latins erected a monument to him, with the inscription <title>To the Father and Native God.</title> Vergil represents Aeneas as landing in Italy seven years after the fall of Troy, and compresses all the events in Italy, from the landing to the death of Turnus, within the space of twenty days. The story of the descent of the Romans from the Trojans through Aeneas was believed at an early period, but rests on no historical foundation.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰόλος</foreign>). (1) The ruler of the winds, son of Hippotas and Melanippé, daughter of Chiron. He reigned over the Aeolian Islands, and made his residence at Strongylé, the modern Stromboli. The island was entirely surrounded by a wall of brass, and by smooth, precipitous rocks; and here he dwelt in continual joy and festivity, with his wife and his six sons and as many daughters. The island had no other tenants. The sons and daughters were married to each other, after the fashion set by Zeus and Heré. Odysseus came in the course of his wanderings to the island of Aeolus, and was hospitably entertained there for an entire month. On his departure, he received from Aeolus all the winds but Zephyrus, tied up in a bag of ox-hide. Zephyrus was favourable for his passage homeward. During nine days and nights the ships ran merrily before the wind; on the tenth they were within sight of Ithaca, when Odysseus, who had hitherto held the helm himself, fell asleep. His comrades, who fancied that Aeolus had given him treasure in the bag, opened it: the winds rushed out, and hurried them back to Aeolia. Judging, from what had befallen them, that they were hated by the gods, the ruler of the winds drove them with reproaches from his isle.

The term was also applied to those standing outside of the tribal union, who were excluded from the right of voting and from military service, and who were bound to pay a poll-tax in proportion to their means. Citizens in the classes and tribes could be expelled from their tribe by the censors in punishment for any fault, and placed among the aerarii. But when the latter were likewise admitted into the tribes (B.C. 308), being enrolled in the city tribes (B.C. 304), which were on that account less esteemed than the country ones, a penal transfer to the aerarii consisted in expulsion from one's proper tribe and removal to one of the city tribes till at least the next census.

The senatorial treasury, which was still kept in the Temple of Saturn, was left under the control of the Senate, but only as a matter of formal right. Practically it passed into the hands of the emperors, who also brought the management of the treasuries under their own eye by appointing, instead of the quaestors, two <seg lang="la">praefecti aerarii</seg> taken from those who had served as praetors. Besides this, they diverted into their own <seg lang="la">fiscus</seg> all the larger revenues, even those that legally belonged to the aerarium.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χαλκός</foreign>). Much confusion has arisen from the fact that both Greeks and Romans use only one term for copper and for that mixture of copper and tin which we call bronze. Excepting perhaps gold, copper is the easiest of metals to find and fashion, being found in lumps, and not, like iron, hidden in ore. Hesiod and Lucretius, and ancient writers generally, made the Age of Bronze precede that of Iron, and that they were right is abundantly proved by the excavations of modern times. There seems to have been a time immediately succeeding the Stone Age when implements were beaten out of pure copper, but it did not last long: the custom of adding tin to copper was introduced, and from that time until the close of ancient history, copper unmixed was seldom used for any purpose, various metals being added to it to increase its hardness. Bronze, containing about 12 to 14 per cent. of tin and 88 to 86 per cent. of copper, was made at a very early period in Egypt and Asia. The use of it was introduced into Greece in prehistoric times, probably by the Phoenicians. Tin is not found in Greece, and, in fact, exists in but few parts of Europe: the Phoenicians are supposed to have travelled in search of it as far as Cornwall and India. The likeness of the Greek word for tin (<foreign lang="greek">κασσίτερος</foreign>) to the Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">kastira</foreign> seems to indicate that the original supply of Greek tin came from India. To account, however, for the enormous quantity of tin which in the Bronze Age must have circulated through Europe is not easy.</p>
 <p>In Homer's time bronze is the usual material for tripods, vessels, armour of defence, and even spears, though iron was beginning to be used for offensive weapons. It is probable that soon after the Homeric age weapons of bronze fell out of use. This compound, however, continued to be largely employed for utensils of all kinds, for works of art and other purposes. The interior of the treasuries of Mycenae and Orchomenus were lined with bronze; bronze was used in historical times for vessels, candelabra, chariots, for the inscribing of treaties and laws, for personal ornament, and in places for coin. Also all instruments used for religious purposes were made of bronze from motives of religious conservatism. The abundance of copper sufficiently accounts for its general use among the ancients. We have a remarkable result of this fact in the use of <foreign lang="greek">χαλκεύς</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">χαλκεύειν</foreign>, where working in iron is meant ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 9. 391" default="NO">Homer <title>Od.</title>ix. 391</bibl>; Aristot. <title>Poët.</title> 25). One of the chief sources of copper in antiquity was Cyprus; from the name of that island is derived the Low Latin <hi rend="italic">cuprum</hi>, and our word copper. The metal was also procured in Euboea, near the town of Chalcis, and in other parts of Greece; also in Campania in Italy, in Germany, and elsewhere. But the most celebrated bronze did not come from those regions, but was an object of special manufacture elsewhere. Two of the most celebrated mixtures were the Delian ( <bibl n="Plin.  34.  9" default="NO">Plin.xxxiv. 9</bibl>) and the Aeginetan (<hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi> 10), which were much used in art. We learn that Myron used the former mixture, Polyclitus the latter. The Delian was reckoned the more precious of these, but still more valuable was the <hi rend="italic">hepatizon</hi> or liver-coloured bronze, and most valuable of all the Corinthian. With regard to the last-mentioned, a silly story was told that it was produced by a fortuitous 
<pb n="34" /><cb />
 mixture of melted metals on the occasion of the burning of Corinth by Mummius. Pliny (xxxiv. 7) sensibly remarks that this story is absurd, because most of the authors of the highly valued works in Corinthian bronze lived at a much earlier period. A large number of varieties of bronze of various colours were known to the ancients, and it seems that they tinted their statues by making them of a judicious mixture of sorts. Thus we find mention of a bronze Iocasté that was pale, of an Athamas that blushed, and of a Pallas with ruddy cheeks made by Phidias. The ancients also understood the art of hardening the metal by dipping it in water and exposing it to the air. Even in Homer there is one passage ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 9. 391" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>ix. 391</bibl>) which is supposed to allude to this process which recent experiments have proved possible. The mixture of copper and zinc which we call brass was known to the later Greeks and Romans, and by them called <seg lang="la">orichalcum</seg> (see <bibl n="Plin.  34. 4" default="NO">Plin.xxxiv. 4</bibl>). The chief authority as regards the kinds and working of bronze is Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34." default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv.</bibl>). He distinguishes copper ore into two kinds: <seg lang="la">cadmea</seg>, found in Italy and Germany, and <seg lang="la">chalcitis</seg> in Cyprus and elsewhere. Of Corinthian bronze ( 8) he distinguishes three kinds: in the first silver predominates, in the second gold, in the third the metals are balanced and harmonized. Of Cyprian bronze ( 94) the chief classes are <seg lang="la">coronarium</seg>, which is of golden hue when divided into thin layers, and <seg lang="la">regulare</seg>, which can be hammered and drawn out into bars and wires. A commoner kind of copper (not Cyprian), called <seg lang="la">caldarium</seg>, does not give to the hammer, and is only fit for melting. At Capua they added to copper to make bronze, 10 per cent. of Spanish <seg lang="la">plumbum argentarium</seg>, which was made of tin and lead in equal proportions. Pliny states that copper was largely used in medicine ( 100 foll.), being either mixed with milk or sulphur for external application to wounds, or taken internally, mixed with honey, in order to cause vomiting. For a mass of details of this character we must refer the reader to Pliny himself.</p>
 <p>In the early bronze-work of Greece and Etruria, the manufacturing processes were simple. The usual process for utensils and ornaments was to work plates with the hammer into the required shape, fastening them with nails or solder, and beating up a pattern on them in <hi rend="italic">repoussé</hi> work, the whole being finished with a graving-tool. Small figures were sometimes cast in the lump. When we are told that the Greeks, Rhoecus and Theodorus, first cast in bronze (Pausan. ix. 41. 1), we must perhaps understand by this that these artists introduced the method of casting statues hollow, not solid, as their predecessors had done. These artists may have lived about the 60th Olympiad, and certainly soon after that time bronze statuary spread with great rapidity over Greece; and indeed bronze continued a favourite material with sculptors until the decay of art. Of the formative process we have a vivid picture on a Greek vase of good period, engraved as the frontispiece to Mr. Murray's <title>History of Greek Sculpture.</title> The extraordinary abundance of works of art in bronze, found on almost all ancient sites, especially at Herculaneum and Pompeii, is a notable fact.</p>
 <p><title>Copper as Coin.</title>—In the coinage of the Greeks and Romans copper is seldom unalloyed. A number of analyses made of late years of Greek coins show a proportion of tin of from 10 to 16 per cent., <cb /> and an occasional 2 to 5 per cent. of lead. Roman <seg lang="la">aes signatum</seg> in republican times shows a proportion of 5 to 8 per cent. of tin and 16 to 29 of lead. After the time of Augustus a change was introduced in the composition of Roman coin. Thenccforward sestertii and dupondii were made of brass, that is to say, of a mixture containing 20 per cent. of zinc and 80 of copper; while the asses were made entirely of copper. Money of copper and bronze stood on a very different footing in Italy to that on which it stood in Hellas and Asia. For in western countries, copper was the usual medium of exchange and measure of value; the chief currency consisted in early times of huge ingots of copper stamped with an official type; and when gold and silver came into use, they at first passed merely as the equivalents and representatives of so much copper. In the East, on the other hand, where gold and silver were the true media of exchange, and copper was used only for very small values, it was seldom minted save as money of account. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnumismatics">Numismatics</ref>.) The Ptolemies of Egypt minted copper pieces of full value; and Brandes (<title>Gewichtswesen</title>, p. 292) is disposed to think that the early Athenian and other copper money was minted up to full weight for a time. But this was exceptional; and in almost all Hellenic settlements, copper money was a currency of tokens; and the weight of it is consequently most irregular. Copper money was first minted in Greece towards the end of the fifth century, at which period the cities of South Italy, Sicily, and Hellas alike began to strike copper pieces in place of the minute silver coins which had hitherto passed as small change. Conservatives objected to the innovation, as we know from Aristophanes (<title>Ran.</title> 725).</p>
 <p>Since the most ancient coins in Rome and the old Italian states were made of <seg lang="la">aes</seg>, this name was given to money in general, so that Ulpian (Dig. 50, tit. 16, s. 158) says, <title>Etiam aureos nummos aes dicimus.</title> (Cf. Hor. <title>Ars Poët.</title> 345; <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 1. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ep.</title>i. 7</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Ep. 23." default="NO" valid="yes"> Ep., 23.</bibl>) For the same reason we have <seg lang="la">aes alienum</seg>, meaning debt, and <seg lang="la">aera</seg> in the plural, pay to the soldiers ( <bibl n="Liv.  5. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.v. 4</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34.  1" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 1</bibl>). The Romans had no other coinage except copper, till B.C. 269, five years before the First Punic War.

The statements of Demosthenes in regard to the disreputable character of his parents are probably groundless. After some experience as a soldier he entered upon the profession of a public clerk, which, however, he soon left to become an actor of indifferent success. But his real talents, aided by his experience of public life gained as a clerk, soon made him prominent when he turned his attention to a political career. In B.C. 348, after the fall of Olynthus, he attracted attention by advocating a general council of the Greek States to concert measures 
<pb n="35" /><cb />
 against King Philip. But the failure of the embassy to Arcadia, which he undertook in pursuance of this plan, seems to have so discouraged him that he immediately changed sides, and was thenceforth an adherent of the peace party. In this capacity he played a conspicuous part as a member of the famous embassy to Philip in <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c</hi>. 346, preliminary to the peace of Philocrates. The complicated details of these negotiations need not be given here. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdemosthenes">Demosthenes</ref>; Philip II.) It is sufficient to say that Aeschines was won over by Philip's flattery (there is no proof that he was actually bribed, beyond the partisan statement of Demosthenes), and became convinced that a close alliance with the Macedonian king was the safest <figure id="fig.00035">

</figure> course for Athens. Almost immediately after the conclusion of the peace, he was indicted by Timarchus, an adherent of Demosthenes, for treasonablc conduct, but was triumphantly acquitted. A second accusation, brought by Demosthenes himself in <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c</hi>. 343, was more nearly successful, and Aeschines narrowly escaped conviction, after an able defence, in which he was aided by the intercession of Eubulus and Phocion. Aeschines next appears as one of the representatives of Athens at the Amphictyonic Council at Delphi in <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c</hi>. 339. Here, as he tells us, he was so enraged by an unjust complaint which the delegates from Amphissa brought against Athens, that he in turn made a vehement <cb /> counter-attack on the Amphissians for their occupation of the sacred plain of Cirrha. So infuriated were the Amphictyons by his invective that, after burning the buildings of the offending Amphissian settlers, they voted to hold a special meeting of the council to consider what further punishment should be inflicted. Athens and Thebes refused to send delegates to this assembly, and thus became involved in war with Philip and the rest of the Amphictyons—a war which resulted in the fatal battle of Chaeronea and the downfall of Athenian independence.</p>
 <p>In stirring up this new conflict, Aeschines certainly played into the hands of Philip, who was awaiting an opportunity for armed interference in the affairs of Central Greece; but here, too, the charge of bribery rests on the unsupported testimony of his bitterest enemy. After the battle of Chaeronea, the party of Aeschines naturally fell into disfavour. He does not figure prominently in public affairs again till B.C. 330, when he made a final effort to defeat his hated rival. An obscure politician named Ctesiphon had in <hi rend="SmallCaps">b. c</hi>. 336 brought in a bill proposing to confer a golden crown upon Demosthenes for his services to the State. Aeschines raised objection to this on the score of illegality. The case did not come to trial till six years had elapsed, and then each of the orators exhausted every effort to crush his opponent. But Aeschines was the weaker, both in genius and in merit, and, not receiving the fifth part of the votes of the court, he was fined one thousand drachmas, and lost the right of appearing before the people in a similar capacity again. He left Athens and went first to Ephesus and afterwards to Rhodes, where he is said to have opened a school of oratory. He outlived his great opponent and died at Samos at the age of seventy-five.</p>
 <p>Only three orations of Aeschines have been preserved, and all of these bear, directly or indirectly, on his quarrel with Demosthenes. Their titles are: <title>(a) Against Timarchus, (b) On the Dishonest Embassy, (c) Against Ctesiphon.</title> The occasion and subject of each have been noticed above. The second of them is generally considered to be the best. In natural gifts of oratory Aeschines was inferior to Demosthenes alone among his contemporaries. He excelled particularly in brilliant narrative, and was also one of the first to win a reputation for extemporaneous speech. He was less careful in his composition than Demosthenes, and was inferior to him in vigour and moral earnestness.</p>
 <p>The editions of Schultz <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1865)</bibl> and Weidner <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1872)</bibl> are among the most important. Richardson's edition of Weidner's <title>Against Ctesiphon</title> may be recommended to American readers.

Three others that exist and that are ascribed to Aeschines are spurious. They treat (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) of Virtue, (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) of Riches, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of Death.

<div2 id="crossaeschylus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰσχύλος</foreign>). The son of Euphorion, born in the Attic deme of Eleusis in the year B.C. 525. 
<pb n="36" /><cb />
 The period of his youth and early manhood coincides with the great national struggle which both Asiatic and European Hellas were forced to wage against the barbarians in the first twenty years of the fifth century. In this conflict he played the part of a brave soldier at the battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea, and his works abound in traces of the warlike and patriotic feeling of those stirring days. His brother Cynegirus met an heroic death at Marathon, and another distinguished soldier of Salamis, Aminias, is said to have been of the same family, but this is probably an error. We know little of the youth and education of Aeschylus, but it is certain that he began his career as a tragic poet before the age of thirty years, though his first victory was not gained till 485. About the year 470 he went to Sicily at the invitation of King  Hieroof Syracuse. Here he composed his <title>Aetnaean Women</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰτναῖαι</foreign>), in honour of the newly founded city of Aetna. His departure from Athens has been ascribed to an indictment by the Athenians for profanation of the mysteries. But it was the policy of Hiero to attract literary men to his brilliant court, and the presence of Aeschylus there needs no more explanation than that of Simonides and Pindar during the same period. Later in his life he visited Sicily a second time, where he met his death in 456. Among the many mythical details with which tradition has surrounded the life of Aeschylus, it is said that he was killed by an eagle letting fall a tortoise upon his bald head, supposing it to be a stone. The high honour in which he was held by the Athenians after his death is shown by the fact that in later times it was made lawful to reproduce his plays in competition for the prize against new tragedies. <figure id="fig.00036">
<head orig="Aeschylus. (Capitoline Museum.)">Aeschylus. (Capitoline Museum.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Aeschylus is said to have produced seventy-two, or even ninety dramas, and to have gained the first prize thirteen times. As each poet competed with four plays (three tragedies and a satyric drama), it appears that Aeschylus was successful in more than half of all his contests. Only seven of his tragedies have come down to us. They will be described in what seems to have beén their chronological order.</p>
 <p>(1) The <title>Suppliants</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱκέτιδες</foreign>) takes its name from the chorus representing the fifty daughters of Danaüs fleeing to Argos for protection from the sons of Aegyptus. The prominence of the chorus, the small number of characters, and the absence of a prologue mark this play as the earliest of those of <cb /> Aeschylus which we have, and consequently the oldest Greek drama extant. Its undeniable merits are much obscured by the very corrupt state of the text.</p>
 <p>(2) The <title>Persians</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πέρσαι</foreign>) is unique among the Greek tragedies which we possess in drawing its theme from history rather than from myth. The central point of interest is found in a splendid narrative of the battle of Salamis, but by an artifice of the poet the scene of the play is laid in Susa, and the laments of Atossa and the Persian nobles supply the tragic elements. The <title>Persians</title> was produced in B.C. 472, as part of a tetralogy consisting of the <title>Phineus, Persians, Glaucus</title> <foreign lang="greek">ποτνιεύς</foreign>, and <title>Prometheus the Fire-kindler</title> (<foreign lang="greek">πυρκαεύς</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(3) The <title>Seven against Thebes</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑπτὰ ἐπὶ Θήβας</foreign>) was produced in B.C. 467, as the third play in a tetralogy of which the remaining pieces were the <title>Laïus</title>, <title>Oedipus</title>, and the satyric drama called <title>The Sphinx.</title> It includes a magnificent description of the seven Argive champions and their Theban opponents, with the final victory of Thebes, and a hint, at the close, of the Antigoné-motive, afterwards so finely worked out by Sophocles. In this play, as in the <title>Persians</title>, the martial spirit of Aeschylus finds ample room for manifestation. Both dramas are “full of war,” to quote the words of Aristophanes (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1021" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Frogs</title>, 1021</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(4) The <title>Prometheus Bound</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Προμηθεὺς δεσμώτης</foreign>), with its companion pieces the <title>Prometheus Loosed</title> (<foreign lang="greek">λυόμενος</foreign>) and the <title>Prometheus the Fire-bearer</title> (<foreign lang="greek">πυρφόρος</foreign>), treated the history of the rebellious Titan who steadfastly suffered the wrath of Zeus for his benefactions to mankind. The <title>Prometheus Bound</title>, the only play of the trilogy which has come down to us, depicts the hero, fettered to a rock in Scythia, and threatened by Hermes with a penalty still more severe. But he proudly refuses to submit to the will of the new ruler of Olympus, and at the close of the play he is struck by the thunderbolt, and, with the rock to which he is fastened, sinks out of sight. The second play described the final reconciliation and the liberation of Prometheus; while the third (see Westphal's <title>Proleg. to Aeschylus</title>, p. 207 foll.) probably celebrated the establishment of Prometheus in Attica as a benignant deity. No Greek tragedy has been more admired than the <title>Prometheus Bound.</title> In the grandeur of its action and the sublimity of character displayed, as well as in the exquisite pathos of some of its scenes, it stands almost unequalled. The Prometheus trilogy was probably produced either in B.C. 468 or 466 (Christ), or about ten years earlier (Wecklein).</p>
 <p>(5) The trilogy composed of the <title>Agamemnon</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀγαμέμνων</foreign>), <title>Choephori</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Χοηφόροι</foreign>), and <title>Eumenides</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Εὐμενίδες</foreign>), comes last in the list, and is of special interest from the fact that it is the only complete trilogy which is extant from any of the Greek tragedians. In the <title>Agamemnon</title> the poet describes the return of the victorious king from Troy, and his murder by Clytaemnestra and her paramour Aegisthus. In the <title>Choephori</title>, Orestes, son of Agamemnon, now grown to manhood, returns, and with the help of his friend Pylades avenges the murder of his father by putting to death the guilty pair, and is himself, in turn, driven frantic by the Erinyes. In the <title>Eumenides</title> he flees to Athens, where he is tried, and by the advocacy of Apollo and the casting vote of Athené he is acquitted, and the family curse comes to an end. This great trilogy shows the genius of Aeschylus in its loftiest form. Each play is complete in itself, and yet each is but a single act in the 
<pb n="37" /><cb />
 mighty drama of crime, vengeance, and expiation. The <title>Agamemnon</title> is the most powerful of the three plays, and probably the greatest work of Aeschylus, if indeed it is not the most impressive tragedy in existence. The trilogy is usually known as the <title>Oresteia</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὀρέστεια</foreign>), and, with the satyric play <title>Proteus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πρωτεύς</foreign>), was produced in B.C. 458.</p>
 <p>The extant works of Aeschylus show a constant progress in dramatic art. He is said to have added a second actor to the one employed by his predecessors, and in his later plays he adopts, and uses with full mastery, the third actor first introduced by his younger rival, Sophocles. The choral parts, at first the most prominent feature both in extent and importance, gradually give way before the growth of the dialogue. In the scenic effects, too, Aeschylus made many improvements, using extraordinary means to excite wonder or awe. Like Wagner, he was both poet and musician, and, besides training his own choruses, he is said to have taken part as actor in the performances themselves.</p>
 <p>The most characteristic feature of his poetry is its grandeur, both of thought and style, though he is none the less master of lyric beauty and tender pathos. His theology is stern and lofty, and pervaded by the idea of a destiny which controls all things, human and divine. But the hereditary curse that brooded over the families of Labdacus and Pelops was always aided in its destrnctive work by the folly and wickedness of the victims themselves. No poet, in fact, has stated more impressively than Aeschylus the inevitable connection between guilt and punishment. His style, it must be confessed, is sometimes so elevated as to seem almost bombastic, but this apparent fault is the natural result of the poet's mighty current of thought, which could not find vent in the ordinary channels of expression.</p>
 <p>All the existing MSS. of Aeschylus are said by W. Dindorf to be derived from the Codex Mediceus (Laurentianus), which dates back to the eleventh century, and contains many valuable scholia taken from the ancient grammarians. It is the chief authority for the <title>Choephori</title>, of which, however, the text is in a bad condition. The <title>Prometheus, Seven against Thebes</title>, and <title>Persians</title> are more fully represented by MSS. than the other plays. Two codices of the fourteenth century (Florentinus and Farnesianus) supply that portion of the <bibl default="NO"><title>Agamemnon</title> (lines 295- 1026)</bibl> which is missing from the Codex Mediceus.</p>
 <p>The Aldine <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> <bibl default="NO">(1518)</bibl> and the edition of Stanley <bibl default="NO">(London, 1663)</bibl> are worthy of note among the older editions.

<head orig="Aesculapius">Aesculapius</head>

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Asclēpius</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσκληπιός</foreign>). The god of the medical art. In Homer he is not a divinity, but simply the “blameless physician” whose sons, Machaon and Podalirius, were the physicians in the Greek army. The common story relates that Aesculapius was a son of Apollo and Coronis, and that when Coronis was with child by Apollo she became enamoured of Ischys, an Arcadian. Apollo, informed of this by a raven, killed Coronis and Ischys. When the body of Coronis was to be burnt, the child Aesculapius was saved from the flames, and was brought up by the centaur Chiron, who instructed him in the art of healing and in hunting. There are other tales respecting his birth, according to some of which he was a native of Epidaurus, and this was a common opinion in later times. After he had grown up, he not <figure id="fig.00037">
<head orig="Aesculapius. (Berlin.)">Aesculapius. (Berlin.)</head>
</figure> only cured the sick, but recalled the dead to life. Zeus, fearing lest men might contrive to escape death altogether, killed Aesculapius with his thunderbolt; but, on the request of Apollo, Zeus placed him among the stars. He was married to Epioné, by whom he had the two sons spoken of by Homer, and also other children. The chief seat of the worship of Aesculapius was Epidaurus, where he had a temple surrounded with an extensive grove. Serpents were sacred to him, because they were a symbol of renovation, and were believed to have the power of discovering healing herbs. The cock was sacrificed to him. At Rome the worship of Aesculapius was introduced from Epidaurus in B.C. 293, for the purpose of averting a pestilence. The supposed descendants of Aesculapius were called by the patronymic name of Asclepiadae, and their principal seats were Cos and Cnidus. They were an order or caste of priests, among whom the knowledge of medicine was regarded as a sacred secret, and was transmitted from father to son in these families.

In course of time, thanks to his plain, popular manner, the story of his own life was enveloped in an almost inextricable tissue of tales and traditions, which represent him as an ugly hunchback and buffoon. In the Middle Ages these were woven into a kind of romance. A Phrygian by birth, and living in the time of the Seven Sages, about B.C. 600, he is said to have been at first a slave to several masters, till Iadmon of Samos set him free. That he next lived at the court of Croesus, and being sent by him on an embassy to Delphi, was murdered by the priests there, is pure fiction. Under his name were propagated in all parts of Greece, at first only by tradition in the mouth of the people, a multitude of prose tales teaching the lessons of life under the guise of fables about animals. We know how Socrates, during his last days in prison, was engaged in turning the fables of Aesop into verse. The first written collection appears to have been made by Demetrius of Phalerum, B.C. 300.

The people of Aethiopia seem to have been of the Caucasian race, and to have spoken a language allied to the Arabic. Monuments are found in the country closely resembling those of Egypt, but of an inferior style. It was the seat of a powerful monarchy, of which Meroë was the capital. Some traditions made Meroë the parent of Egyptian civilization, while others ascribed the civilization of Aethiopia to Egyptian colonization. So great was the power of the Aethiopians that more than once in its history Egypt was governed by Aethiopian kings. Under the Ptolemies, Graeco-Egyptian colonies established themselves in Aethiopia; but the country was never subdued. The Romans failed to extend their empire over Aethiopia, though they made expeditions into the country, in one of which C. Petronius, prefect of Egypt under Augustus, advanced as far as Napata, and defeated the warrior queen Candacé (B.C. 22).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰτωλία</foreign>). A division of Greece, bounded on the west by Acarnania, from which it was separated by the river Acheloüs; on the north by Epirus and Thessaly; on the east by the Ozolian Locrians; and on the south by the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf. It was divided into two parts—Old Aetolia, from the Acheloüs to the Evenus and Calydon; and New Aetolia, or the Acquired, from the Evenus and Calydon to the Ozolian Locrians. On the coast the country is level and fruitful, but in the interior mountainous and unproductive. The mountains contained many wild beasts, and were celebrated in mythology for the hunt of the Calydonian boar. The country was originally inhabited by Curetes and Leleges, but was at an early period colonized by Greeks from Elis, led by the mythical <ref type="cross" target="crossaetolus">Aetolus</ref> (q.v.). The Aetolians took part in the Trojan War, under their king Thoas. They continued for a long time a rude and uncivilized people, living to a great extent by robbery; and even in the time of Thucydides (B.C. 410) many of their tribes spoke a language which was not Greek, and were in the habit of eating raw flesh. They appear to have been early united by a kind of league, but this league first acquired political importance about the middle of the third century B.C., and became a formidable rival to the Macedonian monarchs and the Achaean League. The Aetolians took the side of Antiochus III. against the Romans, and on the defeat of that monarch, B.C. 189, they became virtually the subjects of Rome. On the conquest of the Achaeans, B.C. 146, Aetolia was included in the Roman province of Achaea.

<div2 id="crossafrica" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Africa">Africa</head>

 <p> (from the Punic <title>Frigi</title>, a district on the north coast). A name used by the ancients in two senses, (1) for the whole continent of Africa, and</p>
 <p>(2) for the portion of North Africa which the Romans erected into a province. In the more general sense, the name was not used by the Greek writers; and its use by the Romans arose from the extension to the whole continent of the name of a part of it. The proper Greek name for the continent is Libya (<foreign lang="greek">Λιβύη</foreign>).</p>
 <p>Considerably before the historical period of Greece begins, the Phoenicians extended their commerce over the Mediterranean, and founded several colonies on the north coast of Africa, of which Carthage was the chief. The Greeks knew very little of the country until the foundation of the Dorian colony of Cyrené (B.C. 620), and the intercourse of Greek travellers with Egypt in the sixth and fifth centuries; and even then their knowledge of all but the part near Cyrené was derived from the Egyptians and Phoenicians. who sent out some remarkable expeditions to explore the country. A Phoenician fleet sent by the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho (about B.C. 600) was said to have sailed from the Red Sea, around Africa, and so into the Mediterranean: the authenticity of which story is still a matter of dispute. We still possess an authentic account of another expedition, which the Carthaginians despatched under <ref type="cross" target="crosshanno">Hanno</ref> (q.v.) (about B.C. 510), and which reached a point on the west coast nearly, if not quite, as far as latitude 10 degrees north. In the interior, the Great Desert (Sahara) interposed a formidable <cb /> obstacle to discovery; but, even before the time of Herodotus, the people on the northern coast told of individuals who had crossed the desert, and had reached a great river flowing towards the east, with crocodiles in it, and black men living on its banks, which, if the story be true, was probably the Niger in its upper course, near Timbuctoo. There were great differences of opinion as to the boundaries of the continent. Some divided the whole world into only two parts, Europe and Asia, but were not agreed to which of these two Libya (i. e. Africa) belonged; and those who recognized three divisions differed again in placing the boundary between Libya and Asia either on the west of Egypt or along the Nile, or at the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea: the last opinion gradually prevailed. Herodotus divides the inhabitants of Africa into four races: two native, namely, the Libyans and the Ethiopians; and two foreign, namely, the Phoenicians and the Greeks. The Libyans, however, were a Caucasian race; the Ethiopians of Herodotus correspond to our Negro races. The whole of the north of Africa fell successively under the power of Rome, and was finally divided into provinces as follows: (1) <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref>;</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosslibya"> Libya,</ref> including (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Libyae Nomos or Libya Exterior, (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Marmarica, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Cyrenaïca;</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Africa Propria</hi>, the former empire of Carthage;</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossnumidia">Numidia</ref>;</p>
 <p>(5) <ref type="cross" target="crossmauretania"> Mauretania,</ref> divided into (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Sitifensis, (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Caesariensis, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Tingitana: these, with</p>
 <p>(6) <ref type="cross" target="crossaethiopia">Aethiopia</ref>, make up the whole of Africa, according to the divisions recognized by the latest of the ancient geographers. The northern district was better known to the Romans than it is to us, and was extremely populous and flourishing. Africa Propria or Provincia, or simply Africa, was the name under which the Romans, after the Third Punic War, B.C. 146, erected into a province the whole of the former territory of Carthage. It extended from the river Musca, on the west, which divided it from Numidia, to the bottom of the Syrtis Minor, on the southeast. It was divided into two districts (<seg lang="la">regiones</seg>), namely, (1) Zeugis or Zeugitana, the district round Carthage;</p>
 <p>(2) Byzacium or Byzacena, south of Zeugitana, as far as the bottom of the Syrtis Minor. It corresponds to the modern regency of Tunis. The province was full of flourishing towns, and was extremely fertile; it furnished Rome with its chief supplies of corn.</p>
 <p>In the days of Strabo, the earlier knowledge possessed by the ancients of Africa was little, if at all, improved. The Mediterranean coast and the banks of the Nile were the only ports frequented by the Greeks. Their opinion respecting the continent itself was that it formed a trapezium, or else that the coast from the Columns of Hercules to Pelusium might be considered as the base of a rightangled triangle of which the Nile formed the perpendicular side, extending to Aethiopia and the ocean, while the hypothenuse was the coast comprehended between the extremity of this line and the straits. The apex of the triangle reached beyond the limits of the habitable world, and was consequently regarded as inaccessible. The knowledge of the day respecting the eastern and western coast of Africa appears to have extended no farther than 12 degrees north latitude, or perhaps 12° 30'. The two sides were supposed to approximate, and between the Hesperii Aethiopes to the west and the <seg lang="la">cinnamomifera regio</seg> to the east, the distance was supposed to be comparatively small. This intervening 
<pb n="41" /><cb />
 space was exposed to excessive heats, according to the common belief, which forbade the traveller's penetrating within its precincts; while, at a little distance beyond, the Atlantic and Indian oceans were brought to unite. The hypothesis which we have here stated made Africa terminate at about one half of its true length, and represented this continent as much smaller than Europe. On the other hand, the opinion of Hipparchus, which united eastern Africa to India, remained for a long period contemned, until Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy had adopted it. This adoption, however, did not prevent the previous hypothesis from keeping its ground in some measure in the west of Europe, where it contributed to the discovery of the route by the Cape of Good Hope. Africa, according to Pliny (vi. 33), was three thousand six hundred and forty-eight Roman miles from east to west. The length of the inhabited part of Africa was supposed nowhere to exceed two hundred and fifty Roman miles. Whatever may be the discussions to which the very corrupt state of the Roman numerals in the pages of Pliny are calculated to give rise, one thing is sufficiently evident, that the Romans knew only a third part of Africa. See the article <ref type="cross" target="crossgeographia">Geographia</ref>, with the maps there given.

While the latter inherited his father-in-law's kingdom, Agamemnon not only drove his uncle out of Mycenae, but so extended his dominions that in the war against Troy for the recovery of Helen the chief command was intrusted to him, as the mightiest prince in Greece. He contributed one hundred ships manned with warriors, besides lending sixty to the Arcadians. (On the immolation of his daughter Iphigenia at Aulis, see <ref type="cross" target="crossiphigenia">Iphigenia</ref>.) In Homer he is one of the bravest fighters before Troy; yet, by arrogantly refusing to let Chryses, priest of Apollo, ransom his daughter Chryseïs, who had fallen to Agamemnon as the prize of war, be brought a plague on the Grecian host, which he afterwards almost ruined by ruthlessly carrying off Briseïs, the prize of Achilles, who henceforth sulked in his tents and refused to fight. After the fall of Troy, Agamemnon came home with his captive, the princess Cassandra; but at supper he and his comrades were murdered by his wife's <cb /> lover, Aegisthus, while the queen herself killed Cassandra. Such is Homer's account; the tragic poets make Clytaemnestra, in revenge for her daughter's immolation, throw a net over Agamemnon while bathing, and kill him with the help of Aegisthus. In Homer his children are Iphianassa, Chrysothemis, Laodicé, and Orestes; the later legend puts Iphigenia and Electra in the place of Iphianassa and Laodicé. Agamemnon was worshipped as a hero.

His ambitious schemes then developed themselves, and he was driven into exile. After several changes of fortune he collected an army, and was declared sovereign of Syracuse, B.C. 317. In the course of a few years the whole of Sicily which was not under the dominion of Carthage submitted to him. In 310 he was defeated at Himera by the Carthaginians, under Hamilcar, who straightway laid siege to Syracuse, whereupon he formed the bold design of 
<pb n="42" /><cb />
 averting the ruin which threatened him by carrying the war into Africa. His successes were most brilliant and rapid. He constantly defeated the troops of Carthage, but was at length summoned from Africa by the affairs of Sicily, where many cities had revolted from him, B.C. 307. These he reduced, after making a treaty with the Carthaginians. He had previously assumed the title of King of Sicily. He afterwards plundered the Lipari Isles, and also carried his arms into Italy, in order to attack the Bruttii. But his last days were embittered by family misfortunes. His grandson Archagathus murdered his son Agathocles, for the sake of succeeding to the crown, and the old king feared that the rest of his family would share his fate. He accordingly sent his wife and her two children to Egypt; and his own death followed almost immediately, in 289, after a reign of twentyeight years, and in the seventy-second year of his age. Some authors relate an incredible story of his being poisoned by Maeno, an associate of Archagathus. The poison, we are told, was concealed in the quill with which he cleaned his teeth, and reduced him to so frightful a condition that he was placed on the funeral pile and burned while yet living, being unable to give any signs that he was not dead.

 <p>(2) Son of Archidamus II., and succeeded his half-brother II. in B.C. 398, excluding, on the ground of spurious birth, and by the interest of Lysander, his nephew Leotychides. From B.C. 396 to 394 he carried on the war in Asia Minor with great success, but, in the midst of his conquests, was summoned home to defend his country against Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, which had been induced by Artaxerxes to take up arms against Sparta. In the year 394 he met and defeated, at Coronea in Boeotia, the allied forces. During the next four years he regained for his country much of its former supremacy, till at length the fatal battle of Leuctra, B.C. 371, overthrew forever the power of Sparta, and gave the supremacy for a time to Thebes. In 361 he crossed, with a body of Lacedaemonian mercenaries, into Egypt, where he died in the winter of 361-360, after a life of above eighty years and a reign of thirty-eight. In person Agesilaüs was small, mean-looking, and lame, on which last ground objection had been made to his accession, an oracle, curiously fulfilled, having warned Sparta of evils awaiting her under a “lame sovereignty.” In his reign, indeed, her fall took place, but not through him, for he was one of the best citizens and generals that Sparta ever had.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>). (1) A word that properly means an assembly of any nature, and is usually employed by Homer for the general assembly of the people. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> seems to have been considered an essential part in the constitution of the early Grecian states, since the barbarity and uncivilized condition of the Cyclopes is characterized by their wanting such an assembly. The <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>, though usually convoked by the king—as, for instance, by Telemachus in the absence of his father—appears to have been also summoned at times by some distinguished chieftain, as, for example, by Achilles before Troy. The king occupied the most important seat in these assemblies, and near him sat the nobles, while the people sat or stood in a circle around them. The power and rights of the people in these assemblies have been the subject of much dispute. Platner, Tittmann, and Nitzsch maintain that the people were allowed to speak and vote; while Heeren and Müller think “that the nobles were the only persons who proposed measures, deliberated, and voted, and that the people were only present to hear the debate, and to express their feeling as a body, which expressions might then be noticed by a prince of a mild disposition.” The latter view of the question is confirmed by the fact that in no passage in the <title>Odyssey</title> is any one of the people represented as taking part in the discussion; while, in the <title>Iliad</title>, Odysseus inflicts personal chastisement upon Thersites for presuming <figure id="fig.00043.2"><head>Plan of a Greek Agora, according to Vitruvius.

 to attack the nobles in the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign>.

 <p>Among the Athenians, the proper name for the assembly of the people was <foreign lang="greek">ἐκκλησία</foreign>, and among the Dorians <foreign lang="greek">ἁλία</foreign>. The term <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> was confined at Athens to the assemblies of the phylae and demi. In Crete the original name <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> continued to be applied to the popular assemblies till a late period.
 </p>
 <p>(2) The name <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> was early transferred from the assembly itself to the place in which the assembly was held; and thus it came to be used for the market-place, where goods of all descriptions were bought and sold. The expression <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορὰ πλήθουσα</foreign>, “full market,” was used to signify the time from morning to noon, that is, from about nine to twelve o'clock.</p>

<head orig="Agrariae Leges">Agrariae Leges</head>

 <p> (<hi rend="SmallCaps">Agrarian </hi> Laws). Laws dealing with the distribution of the Roman public land (<seg lang="la">ager publicus</seg>), and in general to be described as laws providing for the allotment to the poorer <cb /> citizens of land belonging to the state, or regulating the tenure on which these lands should be held. Such assignments of land are said to have been made as early as Romulus (Varro, <title>R. R.</title> i. 10, 2), but the first agrarian law was that proposed by Cassius Sp.in B.C. 486. The public lands were the result of conquest in war. It was not till towards the end of the Republic that we hear of the state's acquiring territory by the gift of a foreign prince. War in the ancient world made the bodies and belongings of the vanquished the absolute property of the victors. No doubt either policy or pity generally interfered to prevent the full exercise of the power. In Italy especially, the persons were not usually made slaves; but though the conquered community was allowed to exist, it was deprived of part, often of a third part, of its lands. These confiscated lands had sometimes been utterly wasted in war, sometimes were still unhurt and in a state of cultivation, sometimes consisted of moorland and wood. Each kind requires separate treatment.</p>
 <p>1. The cultivated lands were dealt with in one, or it may be in all, of four ways.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) Part was sold by the quaestors, and hence called <seg lang="la">agri quaestorii.</seg> According to the Gromatici, the land for this purpose was measured and divided by balks (<seg lang="la">limites</seg>) into square plots (<seg lang="la">laterculi</seg>), measuring ten <seg lang="la">actus</seg> each side, and containing fifty <seg lang="la">iugera</seg>, i.e. thirty-one acres, each. As containing one hundred square <seg lang="la">actus</seg>, it was sometimes called <seg lang="la">centuria.</seg> The earliest instance recorded of a sale was in the case of Pometia, where, although the city was surrendered when about to be stormed, some of the chiefs were slain, some of the husbandmen were sold as slaves, the town was destroyed, and the land sold ( <bibl n="Liv.  2. 17" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.ii. 17</bibl>). The sale under the spear (<seg lang="la">sub hasta</seg>) gave full rights of ownership (Gai. iv. 16). Conquest had extinguished all previous title or claims to the land, and the state would of course give legal effect to its own acts of transfer.</p>
 <p> (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) Part was given and assigned in full ownership to Roman citizens. This land was duly surveyed, measured, divided by balks into centuries, each containing two hundred <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> (one hundred and twenty-five acres), and assigned by lot to Roman citizens. Such land was called <seg lang="la">agri dati adsignati.</seg> The oldest assignments were two <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> to each man; this formed an hereditament (<seg lang="la">heredium</seg>), i.e. he had not the mere use or life interest of the plot, but it passed to his heirs after him. The lots of one hundred men thus formed one century (<hi rend="italic">cent-uir-ia</hi>). Later on, seven <seg lang="la">iugera</seg> were regarded as the normal size of a lot ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 18.  18" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xviii. 18</bibl>); but, in fact, there was great variety, the amount naturally depending upon the extent of land open to distribution and the number of citizens to share in it. The survey and distribution were effected by a special commission of three, five, or ten men ( <bibl n="Cic. Agr. 2. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Agr.</title>ii. 7</bibl>), called <title>IIIviri A. D. A.</title>, i.e. <seg lang="la">agris dandis adsignandis.</seg></p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Part of the confiscated lands were given back to their former owners, and no rent was imposed on these plots.</p>
 <p> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Part was neither sold nor assigned nor restored to the former owners, but let for a rent (<seg lang="la">vectigal</seg>), often for long periods to state contractors (<seg lang="la">mancipes</seg>), who sublet to the nearest occupiers. Hyginus mentions as long a lease as one hundred years.</p>
 <p>2. Besides the cultivated lands still in condition to be sold or let, there were the mountain pastures 
<pb n="45" /><cb />
 and woods. The mountain pastures and woods were often granted (<seg lang="la">concessa</seg>) to the old proprietors, or to the municipality, or to the new Roman colony, or reserved to the state; and other tracts of land were often useful as pastures where there were not sufficient farmers to require them as arable land. Sometimes a small rent was required, and then they came under the head of <seg lang="la">agri vectigales</seg> (<title>Grom.</title> pp. 203, 205). Sometimes strips of wood on the mountain were annexed by the original assignment to the different estates (<seg lang="la">fundi</seg>) of private persons. Pastures, in like manner, were sometimes appropriated to individuals, but held <seg lang="la">pro indiviso;</seg> or sometimes made common to the whole of the community (<title>Grom.</title> p. 48). Appian (<title>Bell. Civ.</title> i. 7) says that taxes were laid for the use of the common pastures, both for larger and smaller animals, i. e. horned cattle and sheep. The last was collected by the publicans.</p>
 <p>3. Appian says that “the larger part of the lands taken from the conquered had been wasted by war, and uncultivated. As the Romans had no time to distribute it, they gave notice that any one who liked might temporarily work it, paying a tax of a yearly tenth of the seed crops, and a fifth of the plantations” (i. e. fruits; for instance, olives and grapes). There is no other authority for this definite historical statement of a notice and a tax. The Gromatici speak frequently of <seg lang="la">agri occupatorii</seg>, i. e. lands belonging to squatters, and explain that it was conquered land occupied by individuals. The word most frequently used to denote this occupation is <seg lang="la">possidere;</seg> the occupiers are <seg lang="la">possessores;</seg> the lands, <seg lang="la">possessiones</seg>—terms which do not, however, imply anything as to the legality of the title by which it is held. But that this sort of occupation was recognized by law is clear from the fact that interference with it by the state was the subject, not of judicial proceedings, but of legislative enactment.</p>
 <p>It does not seem probable that any definite arrangement was made in early times for the occupation of public land which was not assigned, or sold, or leased; and the legal claim of the state to deal with it was as incontestable in theory as it was difficult to enforce without the destruction of those reasonable expectations, arising from long use, which are the foundation of the statesman's view of property. It is disputed whether the patricians alone (to the exclusion of the plebeians) had, before the Licinian laws, the right to hold the public land: as a fact, it was probably the case. They were originally, and continued for long to be, the holders of the government, and they were, as a rule, the richest. Now the occupation of tracts of land wasted in war was not a poor Roman's business; it was at a distance; it required capital; and it was insecure, partly from the enemy on the border, and partly from the state's not having assigned it as private property. Neither the peasant nor the small capitalist would find the occupation of such land at a distance from Rome attractive; moreover, he was liable to be called off to serve in war. The rich man could risk something, could employ slave labour, could judge of the political prospects, and have a potential voice in the actions of the state. Such possessions had a natural tendency to accumulate in the hands of the few. The holders added field to field (<seg lang="la">continuare agros</seg>), partly by purchase from their poorer neighbours, partly by violence, partly by taking in any vacant land <cb /> adjoining. Thus were formed the large estates (<seg lang="la">latifundia, lati fundi</seg>) which, worked by slaves, drove out, or gave no opening for, free peasants, and, portending the ruin of Italy, roused the Gracchi to their famous legislation.</p>

 <p>A Roman general, who was born June 13th, A.D. 37, at Forum Iulii (Fréjus, in Provence), the son of Inlius Graecinus, who was executed by Caligula, and of Inlia Procilla. He received a careful education; he first served in Britain, A.D. 60, under Suetonius Paulinus; was quaestor in Asia in 63; was governor of Aquitania from 74 to 76; and was consul in 77, when he betrothed his daughter to the historian Tacitus, and in the following year gave her to him in marriage. In 78 he received the government of Britain, which he held for seven years, during which time he subdued the whole of the country with the exception of the highlands of Caledonia, and by his wise administration introduced among the inhabitants the language and civilization of Rome. He was recalled in 85 through the jealousy of Domitian, and on his return lived in retirement till his death, in 93, which, according to some, was occasioned by poison administered by order of Domitian. His character is drawn in the brightest colours by his son-in-law Tacitus, whose life of Agricola has come down to us. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstacitus">Tacitus</ref>.

<div2 id="crossagricultura" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Agricultūra">Agricultura</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">In Greece</hi>. Agriculture was a leading industry, at least as early as Homer. The soil was stubborn, fertile plains being comparatively few, and mountains and rocky ground preponderating. But, favoured by a genial climate, agriculture was carried on almost everywhere with a zeal to which the wants of a dense population added their stimulus. That it was regarded as the very groundwork of social life is shown by the fact that its guardian goddess Demeter presided also over wedlock and law. It 
<pb n="46" /><cb />
 was looked upon as the most legitimate way of earning a livelihood. It was carried to the highest pitch in the Pelopounesus, where every scrap of cultivable soil was made to yield its crop, as may be seen to this day by the artificial terraces that scarp every mountain-slope. Much care was bestowed on irrigation. Scarcity of water was supplemented by artificial means; provision was made against irregular bursts of mountain torrents by embanking and regulating the natural outlets, while moist lands were channelled and stagnant waters drained. Water was distributed everywhere by ditches and canals, under the supervision of state officials; and laws of ancient date guarded against the unfair use of a watercourse to a neighbour's damage. See <ref type="cross" target="crossemissarium">Emissarium</ref>.</p>
 <p>The land was mainly cultivated by slaves and serfs, though field labour was not deemed dishonourable to the freeman, except where law and custom forbade his engaging in any sort of handicraft, as at Sparta. In some countries, especially Arcadia, the old-world plan of every man tilling his field with his own hand remained in force to the latest times; and even eminent statesmen like <ref type="cross" target="crossphilopoemen">Philopoemen</ref> (q.v.) would not give it up. Four kinds of grain were chiefly grown—wheat, barley, and two kinds of spelt, to all of which the climate allowed two sowings in the year—besides millet, sesame, various leguminous plants, and several sorts of herbage for fodder. With no less diligence was Greek husbandry applied to gardening, especially to the cultivation of the vine. This, while steadily pursued on the mainland, was developed to an extraordinary extent in the islands, most of which, owing to their mountainous character, did not afford their inhabitants sufficient arable soil. In olive-culture no part of Greece competed with Attica, which also produced the best figs, the fruit most widely cultivated. Kitchen-gardening was practised on the largest scale in Boeotia. Considering the enormous consumption of flowers in wreaths, the rearing of them, especially of the rose, lily, narcissus, and violet, must have been a lucrative business, at least in the neighbourhood of great towns. Meadow-farming was of next to no importance, few districts having a soil adapted for it, and such meadows as there were being used for pasture rather than haymaking.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">In Italy</hi>. In Italy also, the existence of the community was regarded as based upon agriculture. This is proved by the practice of marking the site of the future walls of a new town by a furrow drawn with the plough. At Rome especially, the body of irremovable peasantry long formed the core of the commonwealth. In political life the free peasant was the only factor held in account, and accordingly in war the object was to increase the number of free peasants by planting them out on as much of borderland as could be wrested from the enemy. In early times agriculture was thought the only respectable calling in which a Roman citizen could engage; and manual labour was held in high esteem and brought no discredit upon persons of rank and station, even Cato the Censor working in the fields side by side with his slaves.</p>
 <p>Husbandry was mainly directed to the raising of grain, the ordinary cereal being at first spelt, till, in the fifth century B.C., wheat began to take a place beside it. They also cultivated barley, millet, and leguminous plants, as well as turnips, <cb /> greens, and herbs for fodder. On irrigation and drainage the Italians bestowed much pains. They had no lack of grass-lands, either for pasture or haymaking; and from an early time these were artificially watered. The cultivation of the vine and olive extended as that of grains declined; so did the growth of orchard fruit, which, under the late Republic and the early Empire, received a vast expansion both from the improvement of native kinds and the introduction and naturalization of many foreign fruits. In earlier times the prime favourite among fruit trees had been, as in Greece, the nutritious fig. Agriculture proper was ruined by the acquisition of the first extra-Italian possessions, Sicily and Sardinia; for the corn supplied by the provincials as tribute in kind began to be used, not only in provisioning the armies, but in feeding the urban population. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossannona">Annona</ref>.) As the state, to humour the rabble of Rome, sold this corn at the lowest possible prices, sometimes even below its value, the growth of cereals ceased to be profitable; farmers kept it down to a minimum, and took to cattle-breeding or to raising wine and oil. These branches of industry not only flourished in the face of competition, but, with judicious management, were highly remunerative. The deathblow was given to the Italian peasantry by the increasing employment of slaves and the absorption of small farms in large estates. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosslatifundium">Latifundium</ref>.) On these, besides the growth of wine, oil, and fruit, the breeding of birds, game, and cattle was carried on, as well as woodcraft and special industries such as pottery, charcoal-burning, and others.</p>
 <p>Farming implements, in addition to the plough, or <seg lang="la">aratrum</seg> (q. v.), usually drawn by oxen, which was much the same among Greeks and Romans, and always very imperfect, included a great variety of spades, hoes, and mattocks, and among Romans the harrow (<seg lang="la">irpex, rastrum</seg>), the use of which among the Greeks is doubted. The season for sowing all cereals was usually autumn. At harvest the stalks were cut with the sickle about half-way down, and the rest left standing as stubble, to be either burned or utilized for manure. The process of threshing was very defective.</p>

<head orig="Agrimensōres">Agrimensores</head>

 <p> Land-surveyors; also called <seg lang="la">gromatici</seg>, from <seg lang="la">groma</seg>, the instrument used in measuring. Under the Roman emperors they formed a collegium. Like the jurisconsults, they had regular schools, and received handsome salaries from the state. Their business was to measure unassigned lands for the state, and ordinary lands for the proprietors, and to fix and maintain boundaries. Their writings on the subject of their art were very numerous; and we have still scientific treatises on the law of boundaries, such as those by Frontinus and Hyginus. They were sometimes vested with judicial power, and were called <seg lang="la">spectabiles</seg> and <seg lang="la">clarissimi</seg> in the time of Theodosius and Valentinian. As partitioners of land, the agrimensores were the successors of the augurs, and the mode of their <seg lang="la">limitatio</seg> was derived from the old augurial method of forming the <seg lang="la">templum.</seg> The word <seg lang="la">templum</seg>, like the Greek <foreign lang="greek">τέμενος</foreign>, simply means a division; its application to signify the vault of the heavens was due to the fact that the directions were always ascertained according to the true cardinal points. At the inauguration of a king or consul, the augur looked towards the east and the person to be inaugurated towards the south. Now, in a case like this, the person to be inaugurated was considered the chief, and the direction in which he looked was the main direction. Thus we find that in the case of land-surveying the augur looked to the south; for the gods were supposed to be in the north, and the augur was considered as looking in the same manner in which the gods looked upon the earth. Hence the main line in land-surveying was drawn from north to south, and was called <seg lang="la">cardo</seg>, as corresponding to the axis of the world; the line which cut it was termed <seg lang="la">decumanus</seg>, because it made the figure of a cross, like the numeral These two lines were produced to the extremity of the ground which was to be laid out, and parallel to these were drawn other lines, according to the size of the quadrangle required. The limits of these divisions were indicated by balks, called <seg lang="la">limites</seg>, which were left as high-roads, the ground for them being deducted from the land to be divided. As every sixth was wider than the others, the square bordering upon this would lose <seg lang="la">pro tanto.</seg> When land was undivided it was called <hi rend="italic">arcifinius</hi> or <seg lang="la">arcifinalis</seg>, to which class belonged the <seg lang="la">ager publicus.</seg> See <ref type="cross" target="crossagrariae-leges">Agrariae Leges</ref>.</p>
 <p>Military surveyors were known as <seg lang="la">metatores.</seg> In later times the <seg lang="la">agrimensor</seg> was called simply <seg lang="la">mensor.</seg> Other terms are <title>finitor, decempedator. Gromaticus</title> is properly a professor of the art, and <seg lang="la">geometres</seg> a teacher of it.</p>
 <p>The writings of the Gromatici which are extant contain short treatises of about the second century after Christ, by Frontinus (embedded in a commentary of a later writer called Agennius Urbicus), by Siculus Flaccus, and by apparently two writers bearing the name of Hyginus; several short mathematical treatises of uncertain date by Balbus, Nipsus, a so-called Boëthius, and others; extracts from official registers, probably of the fifth century, of the colonial and other surveys of lands, chiefly in Italy; lists and descriptions of different kinds of boundary stones; extracts from the Theodosian Code, and one title (x. 1) of Justinian's <title>Digest;</title> an obscure and barbarous tract (<seg lang="la">casae litterarum</seg>) <cb /> by one Innocentius, supposed to be school exercises in land-surveying, and some other short pieces. The origin and date of the collection are unknown. Niebuhr awakened modern interest in these writers, and in 1848 Lachmann's critical edition appeared, and superseded all earlier editions. In 1852, a second volume was published, containing essays on the MSS. by Blume, on the text by Lachmann, and on the list of colonies by Mommsen, and an elaborate essay on the whole subject by Rudorff.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀγριώνια</foreign>). A festival celebrated chiefly at Orchomenus, in Boeotia, in honour of Dionysus, surnamed <foreign lang="greek">Ἀγριώνιος</foreign>, i. e. the wild. This festival was solemnized only by women and priests of Dionysus. It consisted of a kind of game, in which the women for a long time acted as if seeking Dionysus, and at last called out to one another that he had escaped to the Muses, and had concealed himself with them. After this they prepared a repast, and, having enjoyed it, amused themselves with solving riddles. This festival was remarkable for a feature which proves its great antiquity. Some virgins, who were descended from the Minyans, and who probably used to assemble around the temple on the occasion, fled, and were followed by the priest armed with a sword, who was allowed to kill the one whom he first caught. This sacrifice of a human being, though originally it must have formed a regular part of the festival, seems to have been avoided in later times.

In the civil wars which followed, and which terminated in giving Augustus the sovereignty of the Roman world, Agrippa took an active part; and his military abilities contributed greatly to that result. He commanded the fleet of Augustus at the battle of Actium in B.C. 31. He was thrice consul, and in his third consulship, in B.C. 27, he built the Pantheon. In the year 21 he married Iulia, daughter of Augustus. He continued to be employed in various military commands till his death in B.C. 12. By his first wife, Pomponia, Agrippa had Vipsania, married to Tiberius, the successor of Augustus; and by Iulia he had two daughters, Iulia and Agrippina, and three sons, Caesar, Lucius Caesar, and Agrippa Postumus. The last was banished by Augustus to the island of Planasia, and was put to death by Tiberius, A.D. 14. See portrait on p. 16.

 <p> “Brazen-bearded.” A name applied to the members of a noted Roman family, because the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) were said to have announced to one of their ancestors, L. Domitius, the victory of the Romans over the Latins at Lake Regillus (B.C. 496), and, in confirmation of the truth of what they told, to have stroked his black hair and beard, which immediately became red. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus</hi>, consul B.C. 122, conquered the Allobroges in Gaul, at the confluence of the Sulga and Rhodanus.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn.

The people afterwards elected him Pontifex Maximus out of gratitude. He was consul in 96, and censor in 92, with Licinius Crassus, the orator.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">L. Domitius Ahenobarbus</hi>, married Porcia, the sister of M. Cato, and was a staunch and courageous supporter of the aristocratical party. He was aedile in B.C. 61, praetor in 58, and consul in 54. On the breaking-out of the civil war in 49 he threw himself into Corfinium, but was compelled by his own troops to surrender to Caesar. He next went to Massilia, and after the surrender of that town repaired to Pompey in Greece. He fell in the battle of Pharsalia (48), where he commanded the left wing, and, according to Cicero's assertion in the second Philippic, by the hand of Antony.</p>
 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cn.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἴας</foreign>). (1) Son of Telamon, king of Salamis, and grandson of Aeacus. Homer calls him Aiax the Telamonian, Aiax the Great, or simply Aiax, whereas the other Aiax, son of Oïleus, is always distinguished from the former by some epithet.

 is represented in the <title>Iliad</title> as second only to Achilles in bravery. In the contest for the armour of Achilles he was conquered by Odysseus, and this, says Homer, was the cause of his death. Later poets relate that his defeat by Odysseus threw him into a state of madness; that he rushed from his tent and slaughtered the sheep of the Greek army, fancying they were his enemies; and that at length he put an end to his own life. From his blood there sprang up a purple flower bearing the letters <title>Ai</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰ</foreign>) on its leaves, which were at once the initials of his name and expressive of a sigh. Homer does not mention his mistress Tecmessa.</p>
 <p>(2) Son of Oïleus, king of the Locrians, also called the lesser Aiax, sailed against Troy in forty ships. He is described as small of stature, but skilled in throwing the spear, and, next to Achilles, the most swiftfooted among the Greeks. On his return from Troy his vessel was wrecked; he himself safely reached a rock through the assistance of Poseidon; but, as he boasted that he would escape in defiance of the immortals, Poseidon split the rock with his trident, and Aiax was swallowed up by the sea. This is the account of Homer. Others tell us that the anger of Athené was excited against him because on the night of the capture of Troy he violated Cassandra in the temple of the goddess (Lycophron, 360 with schol.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">αἰκίας δίκη</foreign>). An action brought at Athens before the Court of the Forty (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ τετταράκοντα</foreign>), against any individual who had struck a citizen of the State. Any citizen who had been thus insulted might proceed in two ways against the offending party—either by the <foreign lang="greek">αἰκίας δίκη</foreign>, which was a private action, or by the <foreign lang="greek">ὕβρεως γραφή</foreign>, which was looked upon in the light of a public prosecution, since the State was considered to be wronged in an injury done to any citizen. It appears to have been a principle of the Athenian law to give an individual who had been injured more than one mode of obtaining redress.</p>
 <p>It was necessary to prove (1) that the defendant had struck the plaintiff otherwise than accidentally or in jest; and</p>
 <p>(2) that the defendant struck the plaintiff first.</p>
 <p>In this action, the sum of money to be paid by the defendant as damages was not fixed by the laws; but the plaintiff assessed the amount according to the injury which he thought he had received, and the judges determined on the justice of the claim.

<head orig="Alarīcus">Alaricus</head>

 <p> (Old German <title>Al-ric</title>, i. e. <hi rend="italic">all rich</hi>). A king of the Visigoths, remarkable as being the first of the barbarian chiefs who entered and sacked the city of Rome, and the first enemy who had appeared before its walls since the time of Hannibal. His first appearance in history is in A.D. 394, when he was invested by Theodosius with the command of the Gothic auxiliaries in his war with Eugenius. In 396, partly from anger at being refused the command of the armies of the Eastern Empire, and partly at the instigation of the minister Rufinus, he invaded and devastated Greece, till by the arrival of Stilicho, in 397, he was compelled to escape to Epirus. He was elected king by his countrymen in 398, having been previously, by the weakness of Arcadius, appointed prefect of Eastern Illyricum. The rest of his life was spent in the two invasions of Italy. The first (400-403), apparently unprovoked, brought him only to Ravenna, and, after a bloody defeat at Pollentia, in which his wife and treasures were taken, and a masterly retreat to Verona, was ended by the treaty with Stilicho, which transferred his services from Arcadius to Honorius, and made him prefect of Western instead of Eastern Illyricum. The second in vasion (408-410) was occasioned by delay in fulfilling his demands for pay and for a western province as the future home of his nation, as also by the massacre of the Gothic families in Italy on Stilicho's death. It is marked by the three sieges of Rome, in 408, 409, and 410. The first of these was raised by a promised ransom. The second ended in the unconditional surrender of the city, and in the disposal of the Empire by Alaric to Attalus, till, on discovery of his incapacity, he restored it to Honorius. The third was ended by the treacherous opening of the Salarian Gate, on August 24th, and the sack of the city for six days. It was immediately followed by the occupation of the south of Italy, and the design of invading Sicily and Africa. This intention, however, was frustrated by his death, after a short illness, at Consentia, where he was buried in the bed of the adjacent river Busentinus, and the place of his interment was concealed by the massacre of all the workmen employed on the occasion. The few personal traits that are recorded of him show the true savage humour of a barbarian conqueror. But the impression left upon us by his general character is of a higher order. The real military skill displayed in his escape from Greece and in his retreat to Verona; the wish at Athens to show that he had adopted the use of the bath and the other external forms of civilized life; the moderation and justice which he observed towards the Romans in time of peace; and the humanity which distinguished him during the sack of Rome, all indicate something superior to the mere craft and lawless ambition which he seems to have possessed.

<head orig="Alcaeus">Alcaeus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκαῖος</foreign>). A famous lyric poet of Mitylené, in Lesbos, an elder contemporary of Sappho. Towards the end of the seventh century B.C., as the scion of a noble house, he headed the aristocratic party in their contests with the tyrants of his native town, Myrsilus, Melanchrus, and others. Banished from home, he went on romantic expeditions as far as Egypt. When the tyrants were put down, and his former comrade, the wise Pittacus, <cb /> was called by the people to rule the State, he took up arms against him also as a tyrant in disguise; but, attempting to force his return home, he fell into the power of his opponent, who generously forgave him. Of his further life nothing is known. His poems in the Aeolic dialect, arranged in ten books by the Alexandrians, consisted of hymns, political songs (which formed the bulk of the collection), drinking songs, and love songs, of which we have but a few unsatisfactory fragments. In the opinion of the ancients, his poems were well constructed, while their tone was in harmony with the lofty passion and manly vigour of his character. The alcaic strophe, so much used by his admirer and not unworthy imitator, Horace, is named after him. See Bergk's <bibl default="NO"><title>Poetae Lyrici</title> (4th ed. 1878)</bibl> for the fragments; and <bibl default="NO">Kock, <title>Alkaeus und Sappho</title> (1862)</bibl>.

Following his master's ideal tendency, he devoted himself mainly to religious subjects, working like him in various materials, gold and ivory, bronze and marble.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀλκιβιάδης</foreign>). The son of Clinias and Dinomaché, born at Athens about B.C. 450, and on the death of his father, in 447, brought up by his relation Pericles. He possessed a beautiful person, transcendent abilities, and great wealth. His youth was disgraced by his amours and debaucheries, and Socrates, who saw his vast capabilities, attempted to win him to the paths of virtue, but in vain. Their intimacy, however, was strengthened by mutual services. At the battle of Potidaea (432) his life was saved by Socrates, and at that of Delium (424) he saved the life of Socrates. After the death of Cleon (422) he became one of the leading politicians, and the head of the war party in opposition to Nicias. In 415 he was appointed, along with Nicias and Lamachus, as commander of the expedition to Sicily. While the preparations for the expedition were going on, there occurred a mysterious mutilation of the busts of the Hermae, which the popular fears connected with an attempt to overthrow the Athenian constitution. Alcibiades was charged with being the ringleader in this attempt. He demanded 
<pb n="52" /><cb />
  an investigation before he set sail, but this his enemies would not grant; but he had not been long in Sicily before he was recalled to stand his <figure id="fig.00052">
<head orig="Bust of Alcibiades.">Bust of Alcibiades.</head>
</figure> trial. On his return homeward he managed to escape at Thurii, and thence proceeded to Sparta, where he acted as the avowed enemy of his country. The machinations of his enemy, Agis II., induced him to abandon the Spartans and take refuge with Tissaphernes (412), whose favour he soon gained. Through his influence Tissaphernes deserted the Spartans and professed his willingness to assist the Athenians, who accordingly recalled Alcibiades from banishment in 411. He did not immediately return to Athens, but remained abroad for the next four years, during which the Athenians under his command gained the victories of Cynossema, Abydos, and Cyzicus, and got possession of Chalcedon and Byzantium. In 407 he returned to Athens, where he was received with great enthusiasm, and was appointed commanderin-chief of all the land and sea forces. But the defeat at Notium, occasioned during his absence by the imprudence of his lieutenant, Antiochus, furnished his enemies with a handle against him, and he was superseded in his command (406). He now went into voluntary exile to his fortified domain at Bisanthé, in the Thracian Chersonesus. After the fall of Athens (404) he took refuge with Pharnabazus. He was about to proceed to the court of Artaxerxes, when one night his house was surrounded by a band of armed men and set on fire. He rushed out, sword in hand, but fell, pierced with arrows (404). The assassins were probably either employed by the Spartans or by the brothers of a lady whom Alcibiades had seduced. He left a son by his wife Hippareté named Alcibiades, who never distinguished himself. See Houssaye, <title>Histoire d'Alcibiade</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(Paris, 1873)</bibl>.

As his father, in departing on the expedition of the Seven against Thebes, had bound him and his brother Amphilochus, then mere boys, to avenge him on their faithless mother, Alcmaeon refused to take part in the second expedition, that of the <ref type="cross" target="crossepigoni">Epigoni</ref> (q.v.), till he had first fulfilled that filial duty; nevertheless his mother, bribed by Thersander with the garment of Harmonia, persuaded him to go. The real leader at the siege of Thebes, he slew the Theban king, Laodamas, and was the first to enter the conquered city. On returning home, he, at the bidding of the Delphian Apollo, avenged his father by slaying his mother, with, or according to some accounts, without, his brother's help; but immediately, like Orestes, he was set upon by the Furies, and wandered distracted, seeking purification and a new home. Phegeus, of the Arcadian Psophis, half purified him of his guilt, and gave him his daughter Arsinoë or Alphesiboea to wife, to whom he presented the jewels of Harmonia, which he had brought from Argos. But soon the crops failed in the land, and he fell into his distemper again, till, after many wanderings, he arrived at the mouth of the Acheloüs, and there, in an island that had floated up, he found the country promised by the god, which had not existed at the time of his dying mother's curse, and so he was completely cured. He married Acheloüs's daughter, <ref type="cross" target="crosscallirrhoe">Callirrhoë, by whom he had two sons, Acarnan and Amphoterus</ref> (q.v.). Unable to withstand his wife's entreaties that she might have Harmonia's necklace and robe, he went to Phegeus in Arcadia, and begged those treasures of him, pretending that he would dedicate them at Delphi for the perfect healing of his madness. He obtained them; but Phegeus, on learning the truth, set his son to waylay him on the road, and rob him of his treasure and his life. Alcmaeon 's sons then avenged their father's death on his murderers. Alcmaeon received divine honours after death, and had a sanctuary at Thebes and a consecrated tomb at Psophis.

In consequence of the way in which Megacles, one of the family, treated the insurgents under Cylon (B.C. 612), they brought upon themselves the guilt of sacrilege, and were in consequence banished from Athens about 595 About B.C. 560 they returned from exile, but were again expelled by Pisistratus. In the year 548 they contracted with the Amphictyonic Council to rebuild the temple of Delphi, and obtained great popularity throughout Greece by executing the work in a style of magnificence which much exceeded their engagement.

 <p> Gaming, or playing at a game of chance of any king. Gaming was looked down upon at Rome, and hence <seg lang="la">aleator</seg> was used as a term of reproach ( <bibl n="Ammon. in Cat. 2. 10" default="NO"> <title>in Cat.</title>ii. 10</bibl><bibl n="Ammon. in Cat. 23" default="NO"> in Cat., 23</bibl>; <title>ad Att.</title> xiv. 5). It was also forbidden by special laws during the times of the Republic and under the emperors (<seg lang="la">vetita legibus alea</seg>,  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. <title>Carm.</title>iii. 24</bibl><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 58" default="NO" valid="yes">Hor. Carm., 58</bibl>;  <bibl n="Cic.

Phil., 56</bibl>; <title>Trist.</title> ii. 470 foll.; <title>Dig.</title> 11, tit. 5). Three such laws occur in the Digest (<hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi>) —the Leges Titia, Publicia, and Cornelia—and likewise a <seg lang="la">senatus consultum</seg> and the praetor's edict; the latter enacting severe penalties on persons compelling others to gamble, and disabling the keepers of gambling-houses from bringing any action for damage or loss against their customers. At what time the two former laws were passed is quite uncertain; but the Lex Cornelia was probably one of the laws of the dictator Sulla , who, we know, made several enactments to check the extravagance and expense of private persons. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosssumptuariae-leges">Sumptus</ref>.) It has been inferred from the <title>Miles Gloriosus</title> (<bibl n="Plaut. Mil. 2.2.9" default="NO">ii. 2, 9</bibl>) that gaming must have been forbidden by law in Plautus's time; but the <seg lang="la">lex talaria</seg> (<seg lang="la">alearia</seg>, Ritschl) in this passage seems rather to refer to the laws of the game than to any public enactment. Those who were convicted of gaming were condemned to pay four times the sum they had staked (Pseudo-Ascon. <seg lang="la">in</seg>  <bibl n="Cic.  Div. 24" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Div.</title>24</bibl>, p. 110, ed. Orelli), and became <seg lang="la">infames</seg> in consequence. We know that <seg lang="la">infamia</seg> (q. v.) was frequently a consequence of a judicial decision; and we may infer that it was so in this case from the expression of Cicero (“Hominem lege, quae est de alea, condemnatum, <seg lang="la">in integrum restituit</seg>,”  Cic. <title>Phil.</title>l. c.). Games of chance were, however, tolerated in the month of December at the Saturnalia, a period of general relaxation ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 71" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>71</bibl>); and public opinion allowed old men to amuse themselves in this manner ( <title>De Sen.</title> 16, 58). Under the Empire gambling was carried to a great height, and the <cb /> laws were probably little more than nominal. Many of the early emperors—Augustus, Caligula, Claudius, Vitellius, and Domitian—were very fond of gaming, and set an evil example to their subjects in this matter ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 70" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>70</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Aug. 71" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. Aug., 71</bibl>;  Cass. lix. 22;  <bibl n="Suet.

Professed gamesters made a regular study of their art, and there were treatises on the subject, among which was a book written by the emperor Claudius ( <title>Claud.</title> l. c.). All gaming was forbidden finally by Justinian (Cod. 3, tit. 43). See Walter, <title>Geschichte d. röm.

 <p>in Phrygia, or, according to Suidas, of Miletus, who flourished in the second century A.D. He took the name of Cornelius Alexander, from his having been a slave of Cornelius Lentulus, who gave him his freedom and made him the instructor to his children. He was surnamed Polyhistor, from the variety and multiplicity of his knowledge. The ancient writers cite one of his works in forty books, each one of which appears to have contained the description of some particular country, and to have had a separate title, such as <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγυπτιακά, Καριακά</foreign>, etc. Pliny often refers to him. It is probable that he was the author of a work entitled <foreign lang="greek">Θαυμασίων συναγωγή</foreign>, “A collection of wonderful things,” of which Photius speaks.

 <p>known as <hi rend="SmallCaps">the Great</hi>, son of Philip II., king of Macedon, was born at Pella, B.C. 356. He was educated by Aristotle, who acquired a great influence over his mind and character. He first distinguished himself at the battle of Chaeronea (338), where the victory was mainly owing to his impetuosity and courage. On the murder of Philip (336), he ascended the throne, at the age of twenty, to find himself surrounded by enemies on every side. He first put down rebellion in his own kingdom, and then rapidly marched into Greece. His unexpected activity overawed all opposition; Thebes, which had been <cb /> most active against him, submitted when he appeared at its gates; and the assembled Greeks at the Isthmus of Corinth elected him to the command against Persia. He now directed his arms against the barbarians of the North, and crossed the Danube (335). A report of his death having reached Greece, the Thebans once more took up arms; but a terrible punishment awaited them. Alexander took Thebes by assault, destroyed all the buildings, with the exception of the house of Pindar, killed most of the inhabitants, and sold the rest as slaves. He now prepared for his great expedition against Persia. In the spring of 334 he crossed the Hellespont with some 35,000 men. Of these 30,000 were foot and 5000 horse, and of the former only 12,000 were Macedonians. Alexander's first engagement with the Persians was on the river Granicus in Mysia (May, 334), where they were entirely defeated by him. In the following year (333) he collected his army at <ref type="cross" target="crossgordium">Gordium</ref> (q.v.) in Phrygia, where he cut or untied the celebrated Gordian knot, which, it was said, was to be loosened only by the conqueror of Asia. From thence he marched to Issus, on the confines of Syria, where he gained a great victory over Darius, the Persian king. Darius himself escaped, but his mother, wife, and children fell into the hands of Alexander, who treated them with the utmost delicacy and respect. Alexander now directed his arms against the cities of Phoenicia, most of which <figure id="fig.00054">
<head orig="Coin representing Alexander the Great as Zeus Ammon.">Coin representing Alexander the Great as Zeus Ammon.</head>
</figure> submitted; but Tyre was not taken till the middle of 332, after an obstinate defence of seven months. He next marched into Egypt, which unresistingly yielded to him. At the beginning of 331 he founded near the mouth of the Nile the city of Alexandria, and about the same time visited the temple of Zeus Ammon, in the desert of Libya, where he was saluted by the priests as the son of Zeus. In the spring of the same year (331) he set out against Darius, who had collected another army. He crossed the Euphrates and the Tigris, and at length met with the immense hosts of Darius, said to have amounted to more than a million of men, in the plains of Gaugamela. The battle was fought in the month of October, 331, and ended in the complete defeat of the Persians. Alexander was now the conqueror of Asia, and began to adopt Persian habits and customs, by which he conciliated the affections of his new subjects. From Arbela he marched to Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis, all of which surrendered to him. He is said to have set fire to the palace of Persepolis, and, according to some accounts, in the revelry of a banquet, at the instigation of Thaïs, an Athenian courtesan. At the beginning of 330, Alexander marched from Persepolis into Media, in pursuit of Darius, whom he followed into Parthia, where the unfortunate king was murdered by <ref type="cross" target="crossbessus">Bessus</ref> (q.v.), satrap of Bactria. In 329 Alexander crossed the mountains of the Paropamisus (the Hindu Kush), 
<pb n="55" /><cb />
 and marched into Bactria against Bessus, who was betrayed to him and put to death. During the next two years he was chiefly engaged in the conquest of Sogdiana. He also crossed the Iaxartes (the Sir), and defeated several Scythian tribes north of that river. By the conquest of a mountain fortress he obtained possession of Roxana, the daughter of the Bactrian chief Oxyartes, whom he made his wife. It was about this time that he killed his friend Clitus in a drunken brawl. He had previously put to death his faithful servant Parmenion, on the charge of treason. In 327 he invaded India, and crossed the Indus, probably near the modern Attock. He met with no resistance till he reached the Hydaspes, where he was opposed by Porus, an Indian king, whom he defeated after a gallant resistance, and took prisoner, subsequently restoring to him his kingdom, and treating him with distinguished honour. He founded a town on the Hydaspes, called Bucephala, in honour of his horse Bucephalus, who died here, after carrying him through many victories. From thence he penetrated as far as the Hyphasis (Garra). This was the farthest point which he reached, for the Macedonians, worn out by long service, and tired <figure id="fig.00055">
<head orig="Statue of Alexander the Great. (Naples.)">Statue of Alexander the Great. (Naples.)</head>
</figure> of the war, refused to advance farther; and Alexander, notwithstanding his entreaties and prayers, was obliged to lead them back. He returned to the Hydaspes, and then sailed down the river with a portion of his troops, while the remainder marched along the banks in two divisions. He finally reached the Indian Ocean about the middle of 326. Nearchus was sent with the fleet to sail along the coast to the Persian Gulf (see <ref type="cross" target="crossnearchus">Nearchus</ref>); and Alexander marched with the rest of his forces through Gedrosia, in which country his army suffered greatly from want of water and provisions. He reached Susa at the beginning of 325. Here he allowed himself and his troops some rest from their labours; and anxious to form his European and Asiatic subjects into one people, he assigned Asiatic wives to about eighty of his generals. He himself took a second wife, Barsiné, the eldest daughter of Darius. Towards the close of the year 325 he went to Ecbatana, where he lost his great favourite, Hephaestion. From Ecbatana he marched to Babylon, which he intended to make the capital of his empire, as the best point of communication between his eastern and western <cb /> dominions. His schemes were numerous and gigantic, but he was cut off in the midst of them, being attacked by a fever, which was probably aggravated by the quantity of wine he had drunk at a banquet given to his principal officers, so that he died, after an illness of eleven days, in the month of May or June, B.C. 323, at the age of thirty-two, after a reign of twelve years and eight months. He appointed no one as his successor, but just before his death gave his ring to Perdiccas. Roxana was with child at the time of his death, and afterwards bore a son who is known by the name of <ref type="cross" target="crossalexander-aegus">Alexander Aegus</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>The body of Alexander was interred by Ptolemy in Alexandria, in a golden coffin, and divine honours were paid to him, not only in Egypt, but also in other countries. The sarcophagus in which the coffin was enclosed has been in the British Museum since 1802.</p>
 <p>No character in history has afforded matter for more discussion than that of Alexander; and the exact quality of his ambition is to this day a subject of dispute. By some he is regarded as little more than an heroic madman, actuated by the mere desire of personal glory; others give him the honour of vast and enlightened views of policy, embracing the consolidation and establishment of an empire, in which commerce, learning, and the arts should flourish in common with energy and enterprise of every description. Each class of reasoners find facts to countenance their opinion of the mixed character and actions of Alexander. The former quote the wildness of his personal daring, the barren nature of much of his transient mastery, and his remorseless and unnecessary cruelty to the vanquished on some occasions, and capricious magnanimity and lenity on others. The latter advert to facts like the foundation of Alexandria, and other acts indicative of large and prospective views of true policy; and regard his expeditions rather as schemes of discovery and exploration than mere enterprises for fruitless conquest. The truth appears to embrace a portion of both these opinions. Alexander was too much smitten with military glory, and the common selfengrossment of the mere conqueror, to be a great and consistent statesman; while such was the strength of his intellect, and the light opened to him by success, that a glimpse of the genuine sources of lasting greatness could not but break in upon him. The history of Napoleon shows the nature of this mixture of lofty intellect and personal ambition, which has seldom effected much permanent good for mankind in any age.</p>
 <p>In person this extraordinary individual was of the middle size, with a neck somewhat awry, but possessed of a fierce and majestic countenance.

 <p>After many dissensions and bloody wars among themselves, the generals of Alexander laid the foundations of several great empires in the three quarters of the globe. Ptolemy seized Egypt, where he firmly established himself, and where his successors were called Ptolemies, in honour of the founder of their kingdom, which subsisted till the time of Augustus. Seleucus and his posterity reigned in Babylon and Syria. Antigonus at first established himself in Asia Minor, and Antipater 
<pb n="56" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00056">
<head orig="Coin of Alexander the Great.">Coin of Alexander the Great.</head>
</figure>
 in Macedonia. The descendants of Antipater were conquered by the successors of Antigonus, who reigned in Macedonia till it was reduced by the Romans in the time of King Perseus. Lysimachus made himself master of Thrace; and Leonatus, who had taken possession of Phrygia, meditated for a while to drive Antipater from Macedonia. Eumenes established himself in Cappadocia, but was soon overpowered by his rival Antigonus, and starved to death. During his lifetime, Eumenes appeared so formidable to the successors of Alexander that none of them dared to assume the title of king.</p>
 <p>The element of the wonderful in the campaigns of Alexander, and his tragic death at the height of his power, threw an intensely romantic interest around his figure, so that Alexander soon became the hero of romantic story, scarcely more wonderful than the actual, but growing from age to age with the myth-making spirit which can work as freely in fact as in fiction. The earliest form of the story which we know is the great romance connected with the name of <ref type="cross" target="crosscallisthenes">Callisthenes</ref> (q.v.), which, under the influence of the popular tradition, arose in Egypt about A.D. 200, and was carried through Latin translations to the West, and through Armenian and Syriac versions to the East. It became widely popular during the Middle Ages, and was worked into poetic form by many writers in French and German. Alberich of Besançon wrote in Middle High German an epic on the subject in the first half of the twelfth century, which was the basis of the German Lamprecht's <bibl default="NO"><title>Alexanderbuch</title> (ed. by Hinzel, Halle, 1884)</bibl>, also of the twelfth century. The French poets Lambert li Court and Alexandre de Bernay composed, between 1180 and 1190, a romance of Alexander, the twelve-syllable metre of which gave rise to the name <title>Alexandrines.</title> The German poem of Rudolf of Ems was based on the Latin epic of Walter of Châtillon, about 1200, which became henceforward the prevailing form of the story. In contrast with it is the thirteenth-century Old English epic of Alexander (in vol. i. of <bibl default="NO">Weber's <title>Metrical Romances</title>, 1810</bibl>), based on the version of Callisthenes. The story appears also in the East, worked up in conjunction with myths of other nationalities, especially the Persian. It appears in Firdusi, and, among later writers, in Nizami. From the Persians both the substance of the story and its form in poetical treatment have extended to Turks and other Mohammedans, who have interpreted Alexander as the <title>Dsulkarnein</title> (“two-horned”) of the Korân, and to the Hindus, which last had preserved no independent traditions of Alexander.

Driven from his kingdom by his subjects, who detested him, he took up arms against them, and waged a cruel warfare for the space of six years, slaying upwards of fifty thousand of his foes. Having at last re-entered Jerusalem, he crucified, for the amusement of his concubines, eight hundred of his revolted subjects, and at the same time caused their wives and children to be massacred before their eyes. Being re-established on the throne, he made various conquests in Syria, Arabia, and Idumea, and finally died of intemperance at Jerusalem, B.C. 76, after a reign of twenty-seven years (Josephus, <title>Ant.

Of these, the most important are: (1) The capital of <ref type="cross" target="crossaegyptus">Aegyptus</ref> (q.v.) under the Ptolemies, ordered by Alexander to be founded in B.C. 332. It was built on the narrow neck of land between the lake Mareotis and the Mediterranean, opposite to the island of Pharos, which was joined to the city by an artificial dike. On this island a great light-house was built in the reign of Ptolemy <figure /> Philadelphus (283). Under the care of the Ptolemies, as the capital of a great kingdom, and commanding by its position all the commerce of Europe with the East, Alexandria soon became the most wealthy and splendid city of the known world. It was celebrated for its magnificent library, founded by the first two Ptolemies. The library suffered severely by fire when Iulius Caesar was besieged in Alexandria, and was finally destroyed by Amrou, the lieutenant of the calif Omar, in A.D. 651. Under the Romans, Alexandria retained its commercial and literary importance, and became also a chief seat of Christianity and theological learning. Its site is now covered by a mass of ruins. Outside the walls, to the south, the column of Diocletian (“Pompey's Pillar”) still remains; but the two obelisks known as “Cleopatra 's Needles,” which once adorned the gate-way of the royal palace, have been removed—one to London in <cb /> 1878, and one to New York in 1881.

<head orig="Alexandrian School">Alexandrian School</head>

 <p> After the decline of liberty and intellectual cultivation in Greece, Alexandria, in Egypt, became the home and centre of science and literature. The time in which it held this position may be divided into two periods—the first including the reigns of the Ptolemies, from B.C. 323 to 30; the second, from B.C. 30 to A.D. 640, or from the fall of the Ptolemaean dynasty to the irruption of the Arabs. During the first period the intellectual activity at Alexandria was mainly of a purely literary or scientific kind; but during the second, partly from Jewish and Christian influences, it developed into the speculative philosophy of the Neo-Platonists (q. v.) and the 
<pb n="58" /><cb />
 religious philosophy of the Gnostics. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgnostici">Gnostici</ref>.</p>
 <p>Ptolemy Soter, the first ruler who introduced and patronized Greek science and literature in Alexandria, was followed by a still more munificent patron, Ptolemy Philadelphus, who regularly established the celebrated Alexandrian Library and Museum, which had been begun by his father. This Museum was somewhat like a modern university, and within its walls learned scholars both lived and taught. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmuseum">Museum</ref>.) The loss of Greek freedom soon took from Greek thought much of its boldness and originality, but thinkers found substitutes for these in learned research and criticism. They studied grammar, prosody, mythology, astronomy, and medicine, and unfolded their information in long didactic poems in epic form, full of learning, and marked by perfect mastery of verse, but often dull to a degree, and marred by numerous obscure and recondite allusions. Examples of these are the <title>Argonautica</title> of Apollonius Rhodius, and the <title>Alexandra</title> or <title>Cassandra</title> of Lycophron. Other writers of epics were Euphorion, Nicander of Colophon, Dionysius Periegetes, Rhianus, and Oppianus. Many poets employed lyric and elegiac forms for subjects completely unsuited for poetic treatment, which are yet happily expressed in verse. The earliest of the elegiac poets was Philetas of Cos; the greatest, perhaps, <ref type="cross" target="crosscallimachus">Callimachus</ref> (q.v.). Among the lyric poets were Phanocles, Hermesianax, Alexander of Aetolia, and Lycophron. Epigrams and dramas were also written, but of the latter scarcely anything has survived beyond the names of the seven tragedians called the Alexandrian Pleiades. Out of the Amoebean verse or bucolic mime—a rudimentary kind of drama—grew the best product of Alexandrian poetry, the idyls of <ref type="cross" target="crosstheocritus">Theocritus</ref> (q.v.). Still more active than the poets were the grammarians, to whom it is mainly due that we now possess the masterpieces of Greek literature at all. They were both philologists and littérateurs, who explained things as well as words, and were thus a kind of encyclopaedists. Among these the greatest were Zenodotus of Ephesus, Aristophanes of Byzantium, and Aristarchus of Samothrace; only less eminent crities were Alexander of Aetolia, Lycophron, Callimachus, and Eratosthenes. Their chief service consists in having collected the writings then existing, prepared corrected texts, and preserved them for future generations. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstextual-criticism">Textual Criticism</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Alexandrian School had a spirit and character altogether different from the previous intellectual life of Greece. From the attention paid to the study of language, it was natural that correctness, purity, and elegance of expression should be especially cultivated; and in these respects many of its writers are distinguished. But what no study and no effort could give—the spirit that animated the earlier Greek poetry—was in most of these works wanting. In place of it, there was displayed greater art in composition; what had formerly been done by genius was now to be done by the rules furnished by criticism. Where imitation and rule thus took the place of inspiration, each generation of disciples became more artificial and lifeless than their masters, until ultimately criticism degenerated into frivolous fault-finding, and both prose and poetry became laboured affectation. Still, for about four centuries, the Alexandrian School was the centre of learning and science <cb /> in the ancient world. Counting from its origin to its complete extinction, it lasted a thousand years; and its lasting influence upon Latin literature in the Augustan age must not be forgotten. We find it in all the contemporary poets, and notably in Vergil, the greatest poet of the group. See Matter, <title>Histoire de l'École d'Alexandrie</title>, 2 vols. <bibl default="NO">(2d ed.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀλεῖπται</foreign>). Persons who anointed the bodies of the athletes.

To effect this object, the oil was not simply spread over the surface of the body, but also well rubbed into the skin. The oil was mixed with fine African sand, several jars full of which were found in the baths of Titus. One of these is now in the British Museum. This preparatory anointing was called <foreign lang="greek">ἡ παρασκευαστικὴ τρίψις</foreign>.

<head orig="Alliteration">Alliteration</head>

 <p> Alliteration is the repetition of <cb /> the same letter or sound, either intentionally or unconsciously introduced to please the ear or to give additional emphasis to the words by making the sound more forceful. When used to any great extent, it is generally characteristic of a primitive literary taste, and is found in verse and prose that have not yet received their final polish. In AngloSaxon poetry it is one of the chief means of marking the metrical character of the lines, the important words being distinguished by likeness of sound, as in the following from the <title>Phoenix:</title> <lb />“Ne Forestes Fnaest, ne Fyres blaest, <lb />Ne Haegles Hryre, ne Hrymes dryre, <lb />Ne Sunnan haetu, ne Sincald,” etc.</p>
 <p>In Greek, alliteration, like assonance and rhyme, plays no important part, because the earliest Greek verse that we possess represents a stage of development in the art of poetry when such crude devices had already been discarded. Only in some few striking passages does alliteration still appear to be a conscious device of the poet, as in the famous line of Sophocles (<bibl n="Soph. OT 371" default="NO" valid="yes"><title>Oed. Tyr.</title> 371</bibl>), when Oedipus taunts Tiresias with his blindness: <lb /><foreign lang="greek">τυφλὸς τά τ ὠ_τα τόν τε νου_ν τά τ ὄμματ εἰ_</foreign>.</p>
 <p>But in Latin of all periods it is an important element of composition and style, less, however, in the Augustan writers than in their predecessors and successors. Ennius has some extraordinary alliterations, the most absurd being his <quote lang="la">O Tite tute Tati, tibi tanta tyranne tulisti!</quote></p>
 <p>found among the fragments of his <title>Annales.</title> Plautus uses alliteration with comic effect. Lucretius has a definite system, using <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to denote effort, as <cit><quote lang="la">magnos manibus divellere montis</quote> <bibl n="Lucr. 1.201" default="NO" valid="yes">(i. 201)</bibl></cit>;
 while <hi rend="italic">v</hi> denotes pity or sorrow, as in the famous line, with its wailing sound, <cit><quote lang="la">Viva videns vivo sepeliri viscera busto</quote> <bibl n="Lucr. 5.993" default="NO" valid="yes">(v 993)</bibl></cit>.</p>

 Sons of Poseidon by Iphimedia, the wife of Aloeus, son of Canacé and Poseidon; their names were Ephialtes and Otus. They grew every year an ell in breadth and a fathom in length, so that in nine years' time they were thirty-six feet broad and fifty-four feet high. Their strength was such that they chained up the god Ares and kept him in a brazen cask for thirteen months, till their stepmother Eriboea betrayed his whereabouts to Hermes, who came by stealth and dragged his disabled brother out of durance. They threatened to storm heaven itself by piling Ossa on Olympus and Pelion on Ossa, and would have done it, says Homer, had not Apollo slain them with his arrows ere their beards were grown. The later legend represents Ephialtes as in love with Heré, and Otus with Artemis. Another myth represents Artemis as slaying them by craft in the island of Naxos. She runs between them in the form of a hind; they hurl their spears, and wound each other fatally. In the later legend they expiate their sins in the lower world by being bound with snakes to a pillar, back to back, while they are incessantly tormented by the screeching of an owl. On the other hand, they were worshipped as heroes in Naxos, and in the Boeotian Ascra were regarded as the founders of the city and of the worship of the Muses on Mount Helicon.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄλφα-βῆτα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">alphabētum</seg>). A name given to any collection of graphic representations of sounds, and derived from the names of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. The word <seg lang="la">alphabetum</seg> is not found in early writers. It occurs in Tertullian, <title>Haeret.</title> 50, and from his time on. The classical writers used the word <seg lang="la">litteratura</seg>, or <seg lang="la">litteratura prima</seg> ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 11. 13" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xi. 13</bibl>).

 <p>The alphabet is the oldest existing monument of civilization. In all, some two hundred varieties have existed, of which only fifty are now in use. They are all modifications of the primitive Phoenician alphabet, itself probably derived from the ideographic signs of the Egyptians. Thus it is seen that all writing in its origin is due to the use of pictures or symbols standing for either things or abstractions. These ultimately became phonographic, representing (1) syllables and</p>
 <p>(2) elementary sounds. The Greek and Latin alphabets are, of course, of the second class.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">I. The Greek Alphabet</hi>.—Many Greek alphabets are known from inscriptions on stone or pottery, varying according to the district or the date; but the letters in which Greek literature, properly so called, has descended to us belong to the Ionic alphabet, which, being formally adopted at Athens in B.C. 403, became that generally used by all Hellenes. Like the other Greek alphabets, it is in general identical, in the names, forms, and number of the letters, with the Phoenician or old Semitic alphabet. The Greeks must have obtained their knowledge of it from the trading settlements of the Phoenicians in the Aegean not later than the tenth century B.C. This belief was, indeed, held by the Greeks themselves; for though their legends 
<pb n="61" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00061">
<head orig="Ancient Alphabets">Ancient Alphabets</head>
</figure>
 ascribe the perfection of letters to various individuals, such as Palamedes, and Simonides of Ceos, the actual introduction of the alphabet was almost universally credited to <ref type="cross" target="crosscadmus">Cadmus</ref> (q.v.), a Phoenician settled in Boeotia ( <bibl n="Hdt.  5. 58" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.v. 58</bibl><bibl n="Hdt.  59" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 59</bibl>) —the name Cadmus being undoubtedly the same as the Hebrew <title>Kadmi</title>, “an Eastern.” Further proof is found in the fact that the names of most of the Greek letters are pure Semitic words. (See the table above.)</p>
 <p>Scholars are nearly all agreed that writing was known to the Greeks in the Homeric Age (see <title>Iliad</title>, vi. 168), and it is positively stated that lists of victors were kept at Olympia from the year B.C. 776, while we actually possess inscriptions of the seventh century. In the sixth century we hear of geographers, chroniclers, genealogists, legislators, and of schools for teaching the alphabet ( <bibl n="Hdt.  6. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vi. 27</bibl>), showing that by this period a knowledge of writing must have been very generally diffused. As all Greek alphabets differ from the Phoenician in having characters for the vowels (a striking fact), it is necessary to assume that a knowledge of writing was diffused over Greece from a common centre, and that this diffusion occupied a considerable time. (See Mahaffy, <title>Greek Literature</title>, ii. 2, and the same writer in the <title>Journal of Hellenic Studies</title>, ii. 162.)</p>
 <p>At the date of the oldest Greek inscriptions, the vowels <foreign lang="greek">α, ε, ο</foreign> had been developed out of the Phoenician breath-signs <hi rend="italic">aleph, hé</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ἁ</foreign><hi rend="italic">yin;</hi> and <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign> out of the Phoenician semi-consonants <hi rend="italic">yod</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vau.</hi> At this period the writing was still retrograde, i. e. from right to left, after the Semitic fashion. A little later the direction is zigzag, or <seg lang="la">boustrophedon</seg> (<foreign lang="greek">βουστροφηδόν</foreign>), “plough-wise,” as an ox turns when ploughing, the lines proceeding <cb /> alternately from right to left and from left to right. In both these styles the writer often began at the bottom of the roll, and wrote each succeeding line above the last. In the sixth century the practice of writing all the lines from left to right was generally adopted. At about the same time two more vowels were evolved—<foreign lang="greek">η</foreign> out of the Semitic <hi rend="italic">cheth</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">ω</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign>. The character <foreign lang="greek">φ</foreign> had been differentiated out of <foreign lang="greek">θ, χ</foreign> out of <foreign lang="greek">κ</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ψ</foreign> (probably) out of <foreign lang="greek">φ</foreign>. The sounds of <foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">vau</hi>) and Q (Semitic <hi rend="italic">kōph</hi>) began to disappear, and the characters as alphabetic symbols dropped out of use. Up to the third century B.C. only the ordinary capitals were employed, but after this time the more rounded forms known as “uncials” were introduced, together with cursive forms in correspondence. The so-called “minuscules,” or small letters, familiar to us in our modern books, were not evolved until the seventh or eighth century A.D. from a combination of uncials and cursives. From a very early date the Greek alphabet showed a tendency to separate into two types—the Eastern, or Ionic, and the Western, or Chalcidian.

 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">II. The Latin Alphabet</hi>.—The Chalcidian or Western Greek alphabet was carried by the Chalcidians to Italy as early as the ninth century B.C. From it in Italy sprang five local Italic alphabets —the Oscan, Umbrian, Etruscan, Faliscan, and Latin. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdialects">Dialects</ref>.) As the Latins ultimately attained to the intellectual and political leadership 
<pb n="62" /><cb />
 of Italy, the last-named alphabet at last supplanted the other four, and became the only one in general use throughout the Roman Empire, and later of Christendom, thus becoming the prevailing alphabet of the world.</p>
 <p>The Latin alphabet, received originally from the Chalcidian Greeks of Cumae in Campania, has adhered more closely than any of the others to the original Phoenician type, discarding only two letters and adding only three. Its archaic character as compared with that of the Ionic Greek alphabet is seen (1) by its retention of the older signs for L and S;</p>
 <p>(2) by retaining the older value of H;</p>
 <p>(3) by retaining <foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">vau</hi>) and Q (<foreign lang="greek">kōphkōph</foreign>).</p>
 <p>At about the year B.C. 100 the letters Y and Z were reintroduced into the Latin alphabet, but are only used in words borrowed from the Greek, in which they express the non-Latin sounds of <foreign lang="greek">Υ</foreign> and Z. Originally the Latin C had the power of G, but later, when K was disused, C took its place and sound, and the new character G was invented (about B.C. 312) to express the sound formerly denoted by C. In abbreviations, however, such as C., Cn., for Gaius , Gnaeus, the character C has its old power and =G. The emperor Claudius (about A.D. 44) tried to introduce three new symbols into the alphabet, as follows: (1) the inverted digamma <foreign lang="greek">ϝ</foreign>, to make the consonantal sound of V (i. e. the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sound);</p>
 <p>(2) the character known as anti-sigma C, to express the sound of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">Ψ</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">ps</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bs</hi>); and</p>
 <p>(3) the sign <figure />, to express the sound of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign>, i. e. of French <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, or German <hi rend="italic">ü.</hi> These characters never secured any general adoption. The character V was not developed until the tenth century A.D. as distinct from U; and J, as distinct from I, is no older than the fifteenth century. Previously, I and U had been employed as medial and J and V as initial characters to denote the same letters.</p>
 <p>As in Greek, so in Latin, cursive forms arose to replace in part the angular forms of the old capital letters. These cursive characters were used chiefly in correspondence and in business, and are best known to us from the <hi rend="italic">graffiti</hi> found on the walls of Pompeian houses. From the Roman cursive hand our own minuscules were developed.</p>

According to another legend she is the daughter of the Cretan king Melisseus, and brings up the infant god on the milk of a goat, while her sister Melissa (a bee) offers him honey. The horn of the goat is given to her by Zeus, with the promise that she shall always find in it whatever she wishes. From her the cornucopia passed into the possession of the river-god Acheloüs, who exchanged it for his own horn, which Heracles had broken off.

The name is explained by Servius (<seg lang="la">ad</seg>  <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 3. 77" default="NO" valid="yes">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>iii. 77</bibl>) as given because the victim <seg lang="la">ambit arva.</seg></p>
 <p>There were two kinds of Ambarvalia, private and public. The private Ambarvalia are those described by Vergil in detail, and with singular beauty, <bibl n="Verg. G. 1. 338" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Georg.</title>i. 338</bibl> foll. The victims (Cato , <title>R. R.</title> 141) were led three times round the cornfields, before the sickle was put in, accompanied by a crowd of merry-makers (<seg lang="la">chorus et socii</seg>), the reapers and servants dancing and singing the praises of Ceres, while they offered her libations of milk, honey, and wine. The public Ambarvalia are certainly to be distinguished from the <ref type="cross" target="crossamburbium">Amburbium</ref> (q.v.), but have been identified by several writers (Mommsen, Henzen, Jordan) with the sacrifice of the Fratres Arvales to the Dea Dia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossfratres-arvales">Fratres Arvales</ref>.) Marquardt, who on the whole decides against the identity of the two festivals, observes that the correspondence of time and place is in favour of it, as well as the fact that the <seg lang="la">suovetaurilia</seg> were offered at both; but, as he also points out, there is no mention of the Fratres Arvales beating the bounds (<seg lang="la">circumire</seg> or <seg lang="la">lustrare</seg>). The Ambarvalia at Rome were fixed for May 29; in other parts of Italy the day varied in different districts, but was an immovable feast (<seg lang="la">feriae stativae</seg>) in each district. The feast of the Dea Dia, on the other hand, was proclaimed every year; and May 29 might, or might not, coincide with one of the days on which it was held. As regards the locality, the Roman Ambarvalia were performed, according to Strabo, at a spot called Festi, between five and six miles from the city on the way to Alba ( <bibl n="Strab.  5." default="NO" valid="yes">Strab.v.</bibl> p. 230). This spot is identified beyond doubt with the Fossa Cluilia of Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 1.23" default="NO" valid="yes">i. 23</bibl>), Dionysius, and Plutarch; the Campus Sacer Horatiorum, where the legendary encounter took place; and the ruins now called Roma Vecchia, on the left-hand side of the Appian Way at the fifth mile-stone (Burn, <title>Rome and the Campagna</title>, p. 416). 
<pb n="64" /><cb /> The Lucus Deae Diae was at about the same distance from Rome, but on a different road, the Via Portuensis, in a southerly, not an easterly, direction. Both were doubtless on the boundary of the Ager Romanus, or original Roman territory; and in this last circumstance we may trace a connection between the festival of the Arvales and the Ambarvalia without assuming that they were identical.</p>
 <p>The Ambarvalia furnish one of several instances —the Saturnalia at Christmas being another—of heathen festivals taken up by the Church and adapted to Christian uses. There is a close resemblance to these rites in the ceremonies of the three Rogation Days which precede Ascension Day, occurring nearly at the same time of year. “They were anciently in England called ‘Gangdays,’ because processions went out on those days; hymns and canticles being sung, and prayers offered at various halting-spots or stations for a blessing on the fruits of the earth.” The English custom of “beating the bounds” at Whitsuntide is a relic of a similar rite.

<div2 id="crossambitus" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Ambĭtus">Ambitus</head>

 <p> Literally “a going about,” and cannot, perhaps, be more nearly expressed than by our word <hi rend="italic">canvassing.</hi> After the plebs had formed a distinct class at Rome, and when the whole body of the citizens had become very greatly increased, we frequently read, in the Roman writers, of the great efforts which it was necessary for candidates to make in order to secure the votes of the citizens. At Rome, as in every community into which the element of popular election enters, solicitation of votes, and open or secret influence and bribery, were among the means by which a candidate secured his election to the offices of state.</p>
 <p>Whatever may be the authority of the piece entitled <title>Q. Ciceronis de Petitione Consulatus ad M. Tullium Fratrem</title>, it seems to present a pretty fair picture of those arts and means by which a candidate might lawfully endeavour to secure the votes of the electors, and also some intimation of those means which were not lawful, and which it was the object of various enactments to repress.</p>
 <p>A candidate was called <seg lang="la">petitor</seg>, and his opponent, with reference to him, <seg lang="la">competitor.</seg> A candidate (<seg lang="la">candidatus</seg>) was so called from his appearing in the public places, such as the fora and Campus Martius, <cb /> before his fellow-citizens, in a whitened toga. On such occasions, the candidate was attended by his friends (<seg lang="la">deductores</seg>), or followed by the poorer citizens (<seg lang="la">sectatores</seg>), who could in no other manner show their good-will or give their assistance. The word <seg lang="la">assiduitas</seg> expressed both the continual presence of the candidate at Rome and his continual solicitations. The candidate, in going his rounds or taking his walk, was accompanied by a <seg lang="la">nomenclator</seg>, who gave him the names of such persons as he might meet: the candidate was thus enabled to address them by their names—an indirect compliment which could not fail to be generally gratifying to the electors. The candidate accompanied his address with a shake of the hand (<seg lang="la">prensatio</seg>). The term <seg lang="la">benignitas</seg> comprehended generally any kind of treating, as shows, feasts, etc.</p>
 <p>That ambitus, which was the object of several penal enactments, taken as a generic term, comprehended the two species, <seg lang="la">ambitus</seg> and <seg lang="la">largitiones</seg> (bribery). <title>Liberalitas</title> and <seg lang="la">benignitas</seg> are opposed by Cicero, as things allowable, to <seg lang="la">ambitus</seg> and <seg lang="la">largitio</seg>, as things illegal. Money was paid for votes; and in order to insure secrecy and secure the elector, persons called <seg lang="la">interpretes</seg> were employed to make the bargain, <seg lang="la">sequestres</seg> to hold the money till it was to be paid, and <seg lang="la">divisores</seg> to distribute it. The offence of ambitus was a matter which belonged to the <seg lang="la">iudicia publica</seg>, and the enactments against it were numerous. Of these the best known are the Lex Aemilia Balbia (B.C. 182); the Lex Cornelia Fulvia (B.C. 159); the Lex Acilia Calpurnia (B.C. 67); the Lex Tullia (B.C. 63); the Lex Aufidia (B.C. 61); the Lex Licinia (B.C. 58); and the Lex Iulia de ambitu under Augustus. The penalties prescribed by these laws varied from exile, and exclusion from the Senate, to money fines. The Lex Licinia made <seg lang="la">sodalicium</seg>, or “treating,” an offence. By the time of Augustus, ambitus in its proper sense had disappeared, in consequence of the transfer of the elections from the Comitia to the Senate. A list of trials for ambitus under the Republic is given by Rein in his <title>Criminalrecht der Römer.</title>

<head orig="Ambrosius">Ambrosius</head>

 <p> Bishop of Milan in the fourth century, and one of the latest and most distinguished of what are denominated the Fathers of the Christian Church. He was born at Arelaté (Arles), then the metropolis of Gallia Narbonensis, according to some authorities in A.D. 333, according to others, 340. His father was the emperor's lieutenant in that district, and, after his death, Ambrose, who was the youngest of three children, returned with the widow and family to Rome. Here, under the instructions of his mother and his sister Marcellina, who had vowed virginity, he received a highly religious education, and that bias in favour of Catholic orthodoxy by which he was subsequently so much distinguished. Having studied law, he pleaded causes in the court of the praetorian prefect, and was in due time appointed proconsul of Liguria. He thereupon took up his residence at Milan, where a circumstance occurred which produced a sudden change in his fortunes, and transformed him from a civil governor into a bishop. Auxentius, bishop of Milan, the Arian leader in the West, died, and left that see vacant, when a warm contest for the succession ensued between the Arians and Catholics. In the midst of a tumultuous dispute Ambrose appeared in the midst of the assembly, and exhorted them to conduct the election peaceably. At the conclusion of his address a child in the crowd exclaimed, “Ambrose is bishop!” and, whether accidentally or by management, the result throws a curious light upon the nature of the times; for the superstitious multitude, regarding the exclamation as a providential and miraculous suggestion, by general acclamation declared Ambrose to be elected. After various attempts to decline the episcopal office, Ambrose at length entered upon the discharge of its duties, and rendered himself conspicuous by his decided and unremitting opposition to the tenets of Arianism. To his zealous endeavours also was owing the failure of the attempt made by the remains of a pagan party to re-establish the worship of paganism. The strength and ability of Ambrose were such that, although opposed to him on ecclesiastical points, Valentinian and his mother respected his talents, and in moments of political exigency required his assistance. The most conspicuous act on the part of Ambrose was his treatment of Theodosius for the massacre at Thessalonica. The emperor was consigned to a retirement of eight months, and not absolved even then until he had signed an edict, which ordained that an interval of thirty days should pass before any sentence of death, or even of confiscation, should be executed. After having paid the funeral honours to Theodosius, who died soon after obtaining peaceable possession of the entire Roman Empire, the bishop departed from this world, with a composure worthy of his firm character, in the year 397. It is evident that Ambrose was one of those men of great energy of mind and temperament who, in the adoption of a theory or a <cb /> party, hold no middle course, but act with determination towards the fulfilment of their purposes. Ambrose effected much to advance the Roman Catholic Church to the power to which it afterwards attained.</p>
 <p>The writings of this Father are numerous, and the great object of almost all of them was to maintain the faith and discipline of the Catholic Church, while some of them are written to recommend celibacy as the summit of Christian perfection. His best work is the treatise <title>De Officiis</title>, on the duties of a Christian priest. His hymns are also very famous, but only four can be proved to be his— “Deus creator omnium,” “Aeterne rerum conditor,” “Veni redemptor gentium,” and “Iam surgit hora tertia.” The noble “Te Deum laudamus” was long ascribed to him. He introduced the practice of singing choral hymus arranged antiphonally (<title>cantus Ambrosianus</title>). He is probably the author of a Latin version of the <title>History of the Jewish War</title> by Josephus, long ascribed to one Hegesippus. The best text of St. Ambrosius is that in Migne's <title>Patrologia Latina</title> (4 vols.).

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμέθυστον</foreign> or -<foreign lang="greek">ος</foreign>). The amethyst, a precious stone of a purple or violet colour, in different degrees of deepness. In modern mineralogy, the name has been applied to two precious stones of essentially different natures: (1) the Oriental amethyst, which is a rare variety of adamantine spar or corundum; and</p>
 <p>(2) the Occidental or common amethyst. The ancients, on the other hand, reckoned five species, differing in degrees of

 colour. Their Indian amethyst, to which Pliny assigns the first rank among purple or violet-coloured gems, appears to have been our Oriental species, which is nothing more than a violet-coloured sapphire. We see our amethyst, indeed, plainly indicated in one of the reasons assigned by Pliny for its name, that it does not reach the colour of wine (<foreign lang="greek">ἀ</foreign>, priv., and <foreign lang="greek">μέθυ</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">wine</hi>), but first fades into violet. He afterwards suggests another, which was the more common derivation, saying that the Magi falsely asserted that these gems were preservative against intoxication (<foreign lang="greek">ἀ</foreign>, priv., and <foreign lang="greek">μεθύω</foreign>, <seg lang="la">to intoxicate</seg>).

After receiving a careful education, he early entered military service, and fought under Julian against the Alemanni and Persians. In the evening of his days he retired to Rome, and about A.D. 390 began his Latin history of the emperors (<title>Rerum Gestarum Libri</title>), from Nerva , A.D. 96, to the death of Valens, in thirty-one books. Of these there only remain books xiv.-xxxi., including the period from A.D. 353 to 378, which he relates for the most part as an eye-witness. A heathen himself, he is, nevertheless, fair to the Christians. As his work may be regarded as a continuation of Tacitus, he seems, on the whole, to have taken that writer for his model. He resembles Tacitus in judgment, political acuteness, and love of truth. But he is far inferior in literary culture, though he loves to display his knowledge, especially in describing nations and countries. Latin was a foreign language to him; hence a crudeness and clumsiness of expression, which is made even more repellent by affectation, bombast, and bewildering ornamental imagery.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Hammon</hi> (Egyptian <title>Amun</title>, the hidden or veiled one). A god native to Libya and Upper Egypt. He was represented sometimes in the shape of a ram with enormous curving horns, sometimes in that of a ram-headed man, sometimes as a perfect man standing up or sitting on a throne. On his head were the royal emblems, with two high feathers standing up, the symbols of sovereignty over the upper and under worlds; in his hands were the sceptre and the sign of life. In works of art his figure is coloured blue. Beside him is usually placed Muth (the “mother,” the “queen of darkness,” as the inscriptions call her), wearing <cb /> the crown of Upper Egypt or the vulture-skin. His chief temple, with a far-famed oracle, stood in an oasis of the Libyan desert, twelve days' journey from Memphis. Between this oracle and that of Zeus at Dodona a connection is said to have ex<figure id="fig.00066">
<head orig="Ammon and Muth.">Ammon and Muth.</head>

(See <ref type="cross" target="crosstheoria">Theoria</ref>.) When the oracle was consulted by visitors, the god's symbol, made of emerald and other stones, was carried round by women and girls, to the sound of hymns, on a golden ship hung round with votive cups of silver. His replies were given in tremulous shocks communicated to the bearers, which were interpreted by a priest.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀμμώνιος</foreign>). (1) The preceptor of Plutarch. He taught philosophy and mathematics at Delphi, and lived during the first century of the Christian era, in the reign of Nero, to whom he acted as interpreter when that monarch visited the temple at Delphi. Plutarch makes frequent mention of him in his writings, and particularly in his treatise on the inscription of the Delphic temple.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Saccas</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Saccophŏrus</hi> (so called because in early life he had been a porter), a celebrated philosopher, who flourished about the beginning of the third century. He was born at Alexandria, of Christian parents, and was early instructed in the catechetical schools established in that city. Here, under the Christian preceptors, Athenagoras, Pantoenus, and Clemens Alexandrinus, he acquired a strong propensity towards philosophical studies, and became exceedingly desirous of reconciling the different opinions which at that time subsisted among philosophers. Porphyry (<hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Euseb. <title>Hist. Ecc.</title> vi. 19) relates that Ammonius passed over to the legal establishment— that is, apostatized to the pagan religion. Eusebius (l. c.) and Jerome (<title>De S. E.</title> c. 55), on the contrary, assert that Ammonius continued in the Christian faith until the end of his life. But it is probable that those Christian fathers refer to another Ammonius, who, in the third century, wrote a <title>Harmony of the Gospels</title>, or to some other person of this name, for they refer to the sacred books of Ammonius; whereas Ammonius Saccas, as his pupil Longinus attests, wrote nothing. It is not easy, indeed, to account for the particulars related of this philosopher, but upon the supposition of his having renounced the Christian faith. According to Hierocles (<title>De Fato</title>, ap.  <bibl n="Phot. Bibl. 2. 461" default="NO">Phot. <title>Bibl.</title>ii. 461</bibl>, ed. Bekker), Ammonius was induced to adopt the plan of a distinct eclectic school, by a desire of putting an end to those contentions which had so long distracted 
<pb n="67" /><cb />
 the philosophical world. Ammonius had many eminent followers and hearers, both pagan and Christian, who all, doubtless, promised themselves much illumination from a preceptor who undertook to collect into a focus all the rays of ancient wisdom. He taught his select disciples certain sublime doctrines and mystical practices, and was called <foreign lang="greek">θεοδίδακτος</foreign>, “the heaven-taught philosopher.” These mysteries were communicated to them under a solemn injunction of secrecy. Porphyry relates that Plotinus, with the rest of the disciples of Ammonius, promised not to divulge certain dogmas which they learned in his school, but to lodge them safely in their purified minds. This circumstance accounts for the fact mentioned on the authority of Longinus that he left nothing in writing. Ammonius probably died about the year 243.</p>
 <p>(3) A Christian writer, a native of Alexandria, who lived about A.D. 250. He wrote a <title>Harmony of the Gospels</title>, which Jerome cites with commendation.</p>
 <p>(4) The son of Hermias, so called for distinction's sake from other individuals of the name, was a native of Alexandria, and a disciple of Proclus. He taught philosophy at Alexandria about the beginning of the sixth century. His system was an eclectic one, embracing principles derived from both Aristotle and Plato. He cannot be regarded as an original thinker: he was very strong, however, in mathematics, and in the study of the exact sciences, which rectified his judgment, and preserved him, no doubt, from the extravagances of the New Platonism. Ammonius has left commentaries on the <title>Introduction</title> of Porphyry; on the <title>Categories</title> of Aristotle, together with a life of that philosopher; on his treatise <title>Of Interpretation;</title> and scholia on the first seven books of the <title>Metaphysics.</title> The scholia on the <title>Metaphysics</title> have never been edited.</p>
 <p>(5) A priest of one of the Egyptian temples. He was one of the literary men who fled from Alexandria to Constantinople after the destruction of the pagan temples. There he became, together with Helladius, one of the masters of Socrates, the ecclesiastical writer: this is a fact which appears firmly established, and the reasons alleged by Valckenaer for placing him in the first or second century have been generally considered insufficient. Ammonius has left us a work on Greek synonyms, etc., under the title <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων</foreign>. It is a production of very inferior merit. Valckenaer's edition <bibl default="NO">(1739)</bibl> has been reprinted entire, but in a more portable form, at Leipzig <bibl default="NO">(1822)</bibl>, under the care of Schaeffer, who has added the unedited notes of Kulencamp, and the critical letter of Segaar, addressed to Valckenaer, and published at Utrecht <bibl default="NO">(1776)</bibl>.

His wise warnings were unheeded by the other princes; his justice and prudence even brought him into open strife with the savage Tydeus; yet in the fatal closing contest he loyally avenged his death on the Theban Melanippus. In the flight, just as the spear of Periclymenus was descending on him, Zeus interposed to save the pious prophet and make him immortal by cleaving the earth open with his thunderbolt and bidding it swallow up Amphiaraüs, together with his trusty charioteer Baton, like himself a descendant of Melampus. From that time forth, Amphiaraüs was worshipped in various places as an oracular god, especially at Oropus on the frontier of Attica and Boeotia, where he had a temple and a famous oracle for the interpretation of dreams, and where games were celebrated in honour of him.

<head orig="Amphictyŏnes">Amphictyones</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀμφικτύονες</foreign>). Literally “those dwelling around,” but in a special sense applied to populations which at stated times met at the same sanctuary to keep a festival in common, and to transact common business. The most famous and extensive union of the kind was that called, <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg>, the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Amphictyonic League</hi>, whose common sanctuaries were the temple of Pythian Apollo at Delphi, and the temple of Demeter at Anthela, near Pylae or Thermopylae. After Pylae the assembly was named the Pylaean, even when it met at Delphi, and the deputies of the league Pylagorae. The league was supposed to be very ancient, as old even as the name of Hellenes; for its founder was said to be Amphictyon, the son of Deucalion and brother of Hellen, the common ancestor of all Hellenes. ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 200." default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 200.</bibl>) It included twelve populations: Malians, Phthians, Aenianes or Oetoeans, Dolopes, Magnetians, Perrhoebians, Thessalians, Locrians, Dorians, Phocians, Boeotians, and Ionians, together with the colonies of each. Though in later times their extent and power were very unequal, yet in point of law they all had equal rights. Besides protecting and preserving those two sanctuaries, and celebrating from the year B.C. 586 on wards the Pythian Games, the league was bound to maintain certain principles of international right, which forbade them, for instance, ever to destroy utterly any city of the league, or to cut off its water, even in time of war. To the assemblies, which met every spring and autumn, each nation sent two <foreign lang="greek">ἱερομνήμονες</foreign> (= wardens of holy things) and several pylagorae. The latter took part in the debates, but only the former had the right of voting. When a nation <cb /> included several States, these took by turns the privilege of sending deputies. But the stronger states, such as the Ionian Athens or the Dorian Sparta, were probably allowed to take their turn oftener than the rest, or even to send to every assembly. When violations of the sanctuaries or of popular right took place the assembly could inflict fines, or even expulsion; and a State that would not submit to the punishment had a “holy war” declared against it. By such a war the Phocians were expelled B.C. 346, and their two votes given to the Macedonians; but the expulsion of the former was withdrawn because of the glorious part they took in defending the Delphian temple when threatened by the Gauls in B.C. 279, and at the same time the Aetolian community, which had already made itself master of the sanctuary, was acknowledged as a new member of the league. In B.C. 191 the number of members amounted to seventeen, who nevertheless had only twenty-four votes, seven having two votes each, the rest only one. Under the Roman rule the league continued to exist, but its action was now limited to the care of the Delphian temple. It was reorganized by Augustus, who incorporated the Malians, Magnetians, Aenianes, and Pythians with the Thessalians, and substituted for the extinct Dolopes the city of Nicopolis in Acarnania, which he had founded after the battle of Actium. The last notice we find of the league is in the second century A.D.

 <p>The first amphitheatre was probably that of C. Scribonius Curio, which was literally a double theatre, being composed of two wooden theatres placed on pivots, so that they could be turned around, spectators and all, and placed back to back, forming two separate theatres for dramatic exhibits; or face to face, forming an amphitheatre in the ordinary sense of the word. This structure was erected in B.C. 50, and is described by Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  116" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 116</bibl>). The next was built by Iulius Caesar in B.C. 46, and was also of wood. These edifices were exposed to the danger of destruction by fire, and sometimes, too, proved inadequate to support the weight of the enormous crowds of spectators—often as many as 30,000 to 50,000. It was not until the fourth consulate of Augustus (B.C. 30) that an amphitheatre of stone was erected by Statilius Taurus in the Campus Martius ( <title>Octav.</title> 29). This building was the only one of its kind until the erection of the great Flavian amphitheatre. This was carried out in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, when the <title>Amphitheatrum Flavium</title>, which, since the time of Bede, has been known as the Colosseum or Coliseum, arose. An ecclesiastical tradition makes the architect to have been a Christian, one Gaudentius, afterwards <cb /> a martyr. See Burn, <title>Rome and the Campagna</title>, p. 235; Middleton, <title>Ancient Rome in</title> 1885, pp. 303 foll.</p>
 <p>This marvellous building was commenced by Vespasian ( <bibl n="Suet. Vesp. 9" default="NO">Suet. <title>Vesp.</title>9</bibl>) early in his reign, and completed by Titus, who dedicated it in the year A.D. 80, on which occasion 5000 animals of various kinds were slaughtered ( <bibl n="Suet. Tit. 7" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Tit.</title>7</bibl>). He seems not to have added the last story, however, which was done by Domitian, who also caused the ornamental work to be executed. As built by the Flavian emperors, the highest tiers of seats inside, and probably the fourth story, were of wood. Further additions date from a period not earlier than the time of Alexander Severus. (See Burn, p. 235). The name Colosseum was probably given it from the colossus of Nero. No subsequent public amphitheatre was erected in the city of Rome, the little <seg lang="la">amphitheatrum castrense</seg>, near the church of S. Croce, being probably intended only for the soldiers of the Guard. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscolossus">Colossus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Colosseum became the spot where prince and people met together to witness those sanguinary exhibitions, the degrading effects of which on the Roman character can hardly be overestimated. It was partially repaired by Antoninus Pius (Capit. <title>Ant. Pi.</title> 8). In the reign of Macrinus, on the day of the Vulcanalia, it was struck by lightning, by which the upper rows of benches were consumed, and so much damage was done to other parts of the structure that the games were for some years celebrated in the Stadium (Dio Cass. lxxviii. 25). Its restoration was commenced by Elagabalus, and completed by Alexander Severus. A medal of Gordian III. represents the Colosseum with the legend <title>Munificentia Gordiani Aug.</title>, showing that fresh works were undertaken within a few years. It was again struck by lightning in the reign of Decius (Hieron. p. 475), but was soon restored, and the games continued to be celebrated in it down to the sixth century. It is usually stated that, in consequence of the self-devotion of Telemachus, an Asiatic monk, who rushed into the arena to separate the gladiators, and was overwhelmed under a shower of stones, Honorius abolished forever the sacrifices of the gladiators (Theodoret. v. 26); but there is evidence that they were continued even at a later period (Augustin. <title>Confess.</title> vi. 8). In later times the amphitheatre has been used sometimes in war as a fortress, and in peace as a quarry; whole palaces, such as the Cancelleria and the Palazzo Farnese, having been built out of its spoils. At length the popes made efforts to preserve it: Sixtus V. attempted to use it as a woollen factory, and to convert the arcades into shops; Clement XI. enclosed the lower arcades; and in 1750 Benedict XIV. consecrated it to the Christians who had been martyred in it. Notwithstanding the damages of time, war, and spoliation, the Flavian Amphitheatre still remains complete enough to give us a fair idea, excepting in some minor details, of the structure and arrangements of this description of building.</p>
 <p>The very site of the Flavian Amphitheatre, as of most others, furnishes an example of the prodigal contempt of labour and expense which the Roman emperors displayed in their great works of architecture. The Greeks, in choosing the sites of their theatres, almost always availed themselves of some natural hollow on the side of a hill; but the Roman amphitheatres, with few exceptions, stand upon a plain. The site of the Colosseum was in the 
<pb n="70" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00070">
<head orig="Ground Plan of the Flavian Amphitheatre.">Ground Plan of the Flavian Amphitheatre.</head>
</figure>
 middle of the city, in the valley between the Caelian, the Esquiline, and the Velia, on the marshy ground which was previously the lake of Nero's palace, <title>stagnum Neronis.</title> <lb />“Hic ubi conspicui venerabilis amphitheatri <lb />Erigitur moles, stagna Neronis erant.” <lb />( <title>de Spect.</title> ii. 5.)</p>
 <p>No mere measures can give an adequate conception of this vast structure, the dimensions and arrangements of which were such as to furnish seats for 87,000 spectators, around an arena large enough to afford space for the combats of several hundred animals at once, for the evolutions of mimic seafights, and for the exhibition of artificial forests; with passages and staircases to give ingress and egress, without confusion, to the immense mass of spectators, and others for the attendants on the arena; dens for the thousands of victims devoted to destruction; channels for the rapid influx and outlet of water when the arena was used for a <seg lang="la">naumachia;</seg> and the means for the removal of the carcases, and the other abominations of the arena. Admirable pictures of the magnitude and magnificence of the amphitheatre and its spectacles are drawn in the <title>Essays</title> of Montaigne (iii. 6), and in the latter part of Gibbon's twelfth chapter.</p>
 <p>As a general description of the building, the following passage of Gibbon is perfect: “It was a <cb /> building of an elliptic figure, founded on fourscore arches, and rising, with four successive orders of architecture, to the height of 140 [157] feet. The outside of the edifice was incrusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The slopes of the vast concave which formed the inside were filled and surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats, of marble likewise, covered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease about 80,000 spectators. Sixty-four <hi rend="italic">vomitories</hi> (for by that name the doors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth the immense multitude; and the entrances, passages, and staircases were contrived with such exquisite skill that each person, whether of the senatorial, the equestrian, or the plebeian order, arrived at his destined place without trouble or confusion. Nothing was omitted which, in any respect, could be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators. They were protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy, occasionally drawn over their heads. The air was continually refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics. In the centre of the edifice, the <seg lang="la">arena</seg>, or stage, was strewed with the finest sand, and successively assumed the most different forms. At one moment it seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the Hesperides, and was afterward 
<pb n="71" /><cb />
  broken into the rocks and caverns of Thrace. The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible supply of water; and what had just before appeared a level plain might be suddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed vessels, and replenished with the monsters of the deep. In the decoration of these scenes, the Roman emperors displayed their wealth and liberality; and we read on various occasions that the whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver, or of gold, or of amber. The poet who describes the games of Carinus, in the character of a shepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence, affirms that the nets designed as a defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire; that the porticos were gilded; and that the <hi rend="italic">belt</hi> or circle which divided the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with a precious mosaic of beautiful stones” (really, of glass tesserae in imitation of jewels; cf. <ref type="cross" target="crossabaculus">Abaculus</ref>).</p>
 <p>The annexed woodcut, representing a section, not of an entire amphitheatre, but merely of the exterior wall, and the seats included between that and the arena, will serve to convey an idea of the arrangement of such structures in general. It is that of the Colosseum, and is given upon the authority of Hirt; but it is in some respects conjectural, particularly in the upper part, since no traces of the upper gallery are now remaining. The extreme minuteness of the scale renders it impossible to point out more than the leading form and general disposition of the interior; therefore, as regards the profile of the exterior, merely the heights of the cornices of the different orders are shown, with the figures 1, 2, 3, 4 placed against them respectively. </p>
 <p>Owing to the smallness of the cut, the situation and arrangement of staircases, etc., are not expressed, <cb /> as such parts could hardly be rendered intelligible except upon a greatly increased scale, and then not in a single section, nor without plans at various levels of the building.</p>
 <p>The Colosseum covers altogether about five acres of ground; the transverse, or longer diameter of the external ellipse, is 615 feet, and the conjugate, or shorter one, 510; while those of the interior ellipse, or arena, are 281 and 176 feet respectively. Where it is perfect, the exterior is 157 feet high, and consists of four orders—viz., Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—in attached three-quarter columns (that is, columns one fourth of whose circumference appears to be buried in the wall behind them), and an upper order of Corinthian pilasters. With the exception of the last, each of these tiers consists of eighty columns, and as many arches between them, forming open galleries throughout the whole circumference of the building; but the fourth has windows instead of large arches, and those are placed only in the alternate inter-columns—consequently, are only forty in number; and this upper portion of the elevation has, both on that account and owing to the comparative smallness of the apertures themselves, an expression of greater solidity than that below. The arches formed open external galleries, with others behind them; besides which there were several other galleries and passages, extending beneath the seats for the spectators, and, together with staircases, affording access to the latter. At present, the seats do not rise higher than the level of the third order of the exterior, or about half its entire height; therefore, the upper part of the edifice appears to have contributed very little, if at all, to its actual capacity for accommodating spectators. Still, though it has never been explained, except by conjecturing that there were upper tiers of seats and galleries (although no remains of them now exist), we must suppose that there existed some very sufficient reason for incurring such enormous expense, and such prodigal waste of material and labour beyond what utility seems to have demanded. This excess of height, so much greater than was necessary, was perhaps, in some measure, with the view that, when the building was covered in with a temporary roofing or awning (<seg lang="la">velarium</seg>), as a defence against the sun or rain, it should seem well proportioned as to height; and also, perhaps, in order to allow those who worked the ropes and other mechanism by which the velarium was unrolled or drawn back again, to perform those operations without incommoding the spectators on the highest seats.</p>
 <p>With regard to the <ref type="cross" target="crossvelarium">velarium</ref> (q.v.) itself, nothing at all conclusive and satisfactory can now be gathered; and it has occasioned considerable dispute among archaeologists how any temporary covering could be extended over the whole of the building. Some have imagined that the velarium extended only over part of the building; but, independent of other objections, it is difficult to conceive how such an extensive surface could have been supported along the extent of its inner edge or circumference. The only thing which affords any evidence as to the mode in which the velarium was fixed is a series of projecting brackets, or corbels, in the uppermost story of the exterior, containing holes or sockets to receive the ends of poles passing through holes in the projection of the cornice, and to which ropes from the velarium were fixed; but the whole of the upper part 
<pb n="72" /><cb />
 of the interior is now so dismantled as to render it impossible to decide with certainty in what manner the velarium was fastened. The velarium appears usually to have been made of wool, but more costly materials were sometimes employed. When the weather did not permit the velarium to be spread, the Romans used broad-brimmed hats or caps (<seg lang="la">petasi</seg>), or a sort of parasol, which was called <seg lang="la">umbraculum</seg>, from <seg lang="la">umbra</seg>, shade.</p>
 <p>The interior of the amphitheatre was divided into three parts —the <seg lang="la">arena, podium</seg>, and <seg lang="la">gradus.</seg> The clear open space in the centre of the amphitheatre was called the arena, because it was covered with sand or sawdust, to prevent the gladiators from slipping and to absorb the blood. The size of the arena was not always the same in proportion to the size of the amphitheatre, but its average proportion was one third of the shorter diameter of the building.</p>
 <p>It is now quite clear, since the excavations of 1874-75, that the arena had an actual flooring of boards, covered with sand, and movable. There must have been a souterrain, or vaults, at inter<figure id="fig.00072">

</figure> vals at least, if not throughout, beneath the arena, as sometimes the animals suddenly issued apparently from beneath the ground (see the annexed illustration), and machinery of different kinds was raised up from below, and afterwards disappeared in the same manner. That there was also some substruction beneath the arena, in some amphitheatres at least, is evident, because the whole arena was, upon particular occasions, 
<pb n="73" /><cb />
 filled with water, and converted into a <seg lang="la">naumachia</seg>, where vessels engaged in mimic sea-fights, or else crocodiles and other amphibious animals, were made to attack each other. Nero is said to have frequently entertained the Romans with spectacles and diversions of this kind, which took place immediately after the customary games, and were again succeeded by them; consequently, there must have been not only an abundant supply of water, but mechanical apparatus capable of pouring it in and draining it off again very expeditiously.

 <p>The arena was surrounded by a wall, distinguished by the name of <seg lang="la">podium</seg>, although such appellation, perhaps, rather belongs to merely the upper part of it, forming the parapet or balcony before the first or lowermost seats, nearest to the arena. The latter, therefore, was no more than an open oval court, surrounded by a wall about eighteen feet high, measuring from the ground to the top of the parapet; a height considered necessary in order to render the spectators perfectly secure from the attacks of the wild beasts. There were four principal entrances leading into the arena, two at the ends of each axis or diameter of it, to which as many passages led directly from the exterior of the building; besides secondary ones intervening between them, and communicating with the corridors beneath the seats on the podium.</p>
 <p>The wall or enclosure of the arena is supposed to have been faced with marble of more or less costliness; besides which there appears to have been, in some instances at least, a sort of network affixed to the top of the podium, consisting of railing, or, rather, open trellis-work of metal. From the mention made of this network by ancient writers, little more can now be gathered respecting it than that, in the time of Nero, such netting, or <figure id="fig.00073">
<head orig="The Colosseum. (Drawn by Boudier, after Photographs.)">The Colosseum. (Drawn by Boudier, after Photographs.)</head>
</figure> whatever it might have been, was adorned with gilding and amber—a circumstance that favours the idea of its having been gilt metal-work, with bosses and ornaments of the other material. As a further defence, ditches, called <seg lang="la">euripi</seg>, sometimes surrounded the arena. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00073.2">

</figure></p>
 <p>The term <seg lang="la">podium</seg> was also applied to the terrace, or gallery itself, immediately above the lower enclosure, and which was only wide enough to contain two, or at the most three, ranges of movable seats or chairs. This, as being by far the best situation for distinctly viewing the sports in the arena, and also more commodiously accessible than the seats higher up, was the place set apart for senators and other persons of distinction, such as the ambassadors of foreign parts; and it was here, also, that the emperor himself used to sit, in an elevated place called <seg lang="la">suggestus</seg> or <seg lang="la">cubiculum;</seg> and likewise the person who exhibited the games, on a place elevated like a pulpit or tribunal (<seg lang="la">editoris tribunal</seg>). The Vestal Virgins also appear to have had a place allotted to them in the podium, as has been assumed from a passage in Suetonius ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 44" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Aug.</title>44</bibl>), though this is only inferential, as the passage relates to an earlier regulation respecting the theatre. Some of these marble seats were carried away in the Middle Ages to be used as episcopal thrones.</p>
 <p>Above the podium were the <seg lang="la">gradus</seg>, or seats of the other spectators, which were divided into <hi rend="italic">maeniana</hi>, or stories. The first <hi rend="italic">maenianum</hi>, consisting 
<pb n="74" /><cb />
 of fourteen rows of stone or marble seats, was appropriated to the equestrian order. The seats appropriated to the senators and equites were covered with cushions (<seg lang="la">pulvilli</seg>), which were first used in the time of Caligula. Then, after an interval or space, termed a <seg lang="la">praecinctio</seg>, and forming a continued landing-place from the several staircases in it, succeeded the second maenianum, where were the seats called <seg lang="la">popularia</seg>, for the third class of spectators, or the <seg lang="la">populus.</seg> Behind this was the second praecinctio, bounded by a rather high wall, above which was the third maenianum, where there were only wooden benches for the <seg lang="la">pullati</seg>, or common people. The next and last division—namely, that in the highest part of the building—consisted of a colonnade or gallery, where women were allowed to witness the spectacles of the amphitheatre. Some parts of this were also occupied by the pullati. At the very summit was the narrow platform for the men who had to attend to the velarium, and to expand or withdraw the awnings, as there might be <figure id="fig.00074">
<head orig="Interior of the Colosseum.">Interior of the Colosseum.</head>
</figure> occasion. Each maenianum was not only divided from the other by the praecinctio, but was intersected at intervals by spaces for passages left between the seats, called <seg lang="la">scalae</seg> or <seg lang="la">scalaria;</seg> and the portion between two such passages was called a <seg lang="la">cuneus</seg>, because this space gradually widened, like a wedge, from the podium to the top of the building. The entrances to the seats from the outer porticos were called <seg lang="la">vomitoria</seg>, because, says Macrobius, <title>Homines glomeratim ingredientes in sedilia se fundunt.</title></p>
 <p>There were in the amphitheatre concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience, and which sometimes issued from statues placed in different parts of the building. (Lucan, ix. 808; <title>Spect.</title> 3.)</p>
 <p>The provincial amphitheatres were probably, as a rule, built of wood; but in several of the large cities of the Empire there are important ruins of large amphitheatres of stone, of which the best known are at Verona, Paestum, Pompeii, and Capua, in Italy; at Nîmes, Arles, and Fréjus, in <cb /> France; at Pola, in Istria; and at Syracuse and Catania, in Sicily.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ανακρέων</foreign>). A famous Greek lyric poet, born about B.C. 550, at Teos, an Ionian town of Asia, whose inhabitants, to escape the threatened yoke of Persia, migrated to Abdera in Thrace, B.C. 540. From Abdera, Anacreon went to the tyrant Polycrates of Samos, after whose death (B.C. 522) he <cb /> removed to Athens on the invitation of Hipparchus, and lived there, till the fall of the Peisistratidae, on friendly terms with his fellow-poet Simonides, and Xanthippus, the father of Pericles. He is said to have died at Abdera in his eighty-sixth year, choked by the stone of a dried grape. A statue of him stood in the Acropolis at Athens in the guise of an aged minstrel inspired by the wine-god; for Anacreon was regarded as the type of a poet who, in spite of age, paid perpetual homage to wine and love. Love and wine and merry company formed the favourite subjects of his light, sweet, and graceful songs, which were cast in the metres of the Aeolic poets, but composed in the Ionic dialect. Besides fragments of such songs and of elegies, we have also a number of epigrams that bear his name. His songs were largely imitated, and of such imitations we have under his name a collection of about sixty love-songs and drinkingsongs of very various (partly much later) dates, and of different degrees of merit. Of these, the renderings by Thomas Moore are unsurpassed in grace and melody.

<head orig="Anacrĭsis">Anacrisis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign>). The pleadings preparatory to a trial at Athens, the object of which was to determine, generally, if the action would lie (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξετάζουσι δὲ καὶ εἰ ὅλως εἰσάγειν χρή</foreign>). The magistrates were said <foreign lang="greek">ἀνακρίνειν τὴν δίκην</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">τοὺς ἀντιδίκους</foreign>, and the parties <foreign lang="greek">ἀνακρίνεσθαι</foreign>. The process consisted in the production of proofs, of which there were five kinds: (1) the laws;</p>
 <p>(2) written documents, the production of which by the opposite party might be compelled by a <foreign lang="greek">δίκη εἰς ἐμφανῶν κατάστασιν</foreign>;</p>
 <p>(3) testimonies of witnesses present (<foreign lang="greek">μαρτυρίαι</foreign>), or affidavits of absent witnesses (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκμαρτυρίαι</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(4) depositions of slaves extorted by the rack;</p>
 <p>(5) the oath of the parties. All these proofs were committed to writing, and placed in a box secured by a seal (<foreign lang="greek">ἐχῖνος</foreign>) till they were produced at the trial. The name <foreign lang="greek">ἀνάκρισις</foreign> is given to the pleadings, considered expressly as a written document, in Isaeus. If the evidence produced at the anacrisis was so clear and convincing that there could not remain any doubt, the magistrate could decide the question without sending the cause to be tried before the dicasts: this was called <foreign lang="greek">διαμαρτυρία</foreign>. In this case, the only remedy for the person against whom the decision was given was to bring an action of perjury against the witnesses (<foreign lang="greek">ψευδομαρτυρῶν δίκη</foreign>). These pleadings, like our own, were liable to vexatious delays on the part of the litigants, except in the case of actions concerning merchandise, benefit societies, mines, and dowries, which were necessarily tried within a month from the commencement of the suit, and were therefore called <foreign lang="greek">ἔμμηνοι δίκαι</foreign>.

<head orig="Anaxagŏras">Anaxagoras</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀναξαγόρας</foreign>). A Greek philosopher, of Clazomenae in Asia Minor, born about B.C. 500. Sprung from a noble family, but wishing to devote himself entirely to science, he gave up his property to his kinsmen, and removed to Athens, where he lived in intimacy with the most distinguished men—above all with Pericles. Shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War he was charged by the political opponents of Pericles with impiety, i.e. with denying the gods recognized by the State; and, though acquitted through his friend's influence, he felt compelled to emigrate to Lampsacus, where he died soon after, aged seventy-two. He not only had the honour of giving philosophy a home at Athens, where it went on flourishing for quite a thousand years, but he was the first philosopher who, by the side of the material principle, introduced a spiritual, which gives the other life and form. He laid down his doctrine in a work “On Nature” in the Ionic dialect, of which only fragments are preserved. Like Parmenides, he denied the existence of birth or death; the two processes were rather to be described as a mingling and unmingling. The ultimate elements of combination are indivisible, imperishable <seg lang="la">primordia</seg> of infinite number, and differing in shape, colour, and taste, called by himself “seeds of things,” and by later writers (from an expression of Aristotle) <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιομέρεια</foreign>, i. e. particles of like kind with each other and with the whole that is made up of them. At first these lay mingled without order; but the divine spirit—<foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>, pure, passionless reason—set the unarranged matter into motion, and thereby created out of chaos an orderly world. This movement, proceeding from the centre, works on forever, penetrating farther and farther the infinite mass. But the application of the spiritual principle was rather indicated than fully carried out by Anaxagoras: he himself commonly explains phenomena by physical causes, and only when he cannot find these, falls back on the action of divine reason. The fragments of his most important work were edited by Schaubach <bibl default="NO">(1827)</bibl>, and by Schorn <bibl default="NO">(1829)</bibl>. See also Beckel, <bibl default="NO"><title>Anaxagorae Doctrina de Rebus Animatis</title> (Münster, 1868)</bibl>, and Ueberweg, <title>Hist. of Philosophy</title>, vol. i. pp. 63-67 <bibl default="NO">(Eng. trans., N.

Having, in spite of the immunity promised him, fallen into partial loss of civic rights, he left Athens, and carried on a profitable trade in Cyprus. After two fruitless attempts to recover his status at home, he was allowed at last, upon the fall of the Thirty Tyrants and the amnesty of B.C. 403, to return to Athens, where he succeeded in repelling renewed attacks, and gaining an honourable position.  Sentto Sparta in B.C. 390, during the Corinthian War, to negotiate peace, he brought back the draft of a treaty, for the ratification of which he vainly pleaded in a speech that is still extant.

In consequence of her mother boasting that the beauty of her daughter surpassed that of the Nereids, Poseidon sent a sea-monster to lay waste the country. The oracle of Ammon promised deliverance if Andromeda was given up to the monster, and Cepheus was obliged to chain his daughter to a rock. Here she was found and saved by Perseus, who slew the monster and obtained her as his wife. She had been previously promised to Phineus, and this gave rise to the famous fight of Phineus and Perseus at the wedding, in which the former and all his associates were slain.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀνδρόνικος</foreign>). (1) A peripatetic philosopher, a native of Rhodes, who flourished about B.C. 80. He arranged and published the writings of Aristotle, which had been brought to Rome with the library of Apellicon. He commented on many parts of these writings; but no portion of his works has reached us, for the treatise <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Παθῶν</foreign>, and the Paraphrase of the Nicomachean ethics, which have been published under his name, are the productions of another. The treatise <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Παθῶν</foreign> was published by Hösschel in 1593, and was afterwards printed conjointly with the Paraphrase in 1617, 1679, and 1809. The Paraphrase 
<pb n="80" /><cb />
 was published by Heinsius in 1607, at Leyden, as an anonymous work (<title>Incerti Auctoris Paraphrasis</title>, etc.), and afterwards under the name of <title>Andronicus of Rhodes</title>, by the same scholar, in 1617, with the treatise <foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Παθῶν</foreign> added to it.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cyrrhestes</hi>, an astronomer of Athens, who erected, B.C. 159, an octagonal marble tower in that city to the eight winds, now known as the “Tower of the Winds.” On every side of the octagon he caused to be wrought a figure in <hi rend="italic">relievo</hi>, representing the wind which blew <figure id="fig.00080">
<head orig="Tower of the Winds.">Tower of the Winds.</head>
</figure> against that side. The top of the tower was finished with a conical marble, on which he placed a brazen Triton, holding a wand in his right hand. This Triton was so contrived that he turned round with the wind, and always stopped when he directly faced it, pointing with his wand over the figure of the wind at that time blowing. Within the structure was a water-clock, supplied from the fountain in a turret. Beneath the eight figures of the winds lines were traced on the walls of the tower, which, by the shadows cast upon them by styles fixed above, indicated the hour of the day, as the Triton's wand did the quarter of the wind. When the sun did not shine recourse was had to the water-clock within the tower, which building thus supplied both a vane and a chronometer. The structure still stands, though in a damaged state. To the correctness of the sundials Delambre bears testimony, and he describes the series as “the most curious existing monument of the practical gnomonics of antiquity.” There are two entrances, facing respectively to the northeast and northwest; each of these openings has a portico supported by two columns. (See Vitruv. i. 6, 4.)

 <p> An ancient Italian goddess, about whose exact attributes the ancients themselves were not clear.

About full moon on the Ides (15th) of March (then the first month of the year), in a grove of fruit trees at the first milestone on the Flaminian Way, the Romans held a feast under the open sky, wishing each other as many years of life as they drank cups of wine. (See Ovid, <bibl n="Ov.

He is accused by some of having betrayed his country, not only because he gave a favourable reception to Diomedes, Odysseus, and Menelaüs, when they came to Troy, as ambassadors from the Greeks, to demand the restitution of Helen, but also because he withheld the fact of his recognizing Odysseus, at the time that hero visited the city under the guise of a mendicant ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 4. 335" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>iv. 335</bibl>).

Continual additions were made to this collection; and in the tenth century A.D. Constantine Cephalas made a new compilation, as did Maximus Planudes in the fourteenth century. The latter was lacking in literary taste; but his anthology was the only one known to Western Europe until the seventeenth century, when Salmasius, in 1606, found in the library at Heidelberg the much finer collection of Cephalas. The copy made by Salmasius was not, however, published until 1776, when Brunck included it in his <title>Analecta.</title> The first critical edition was that of F.

<div2 id="crossantidosis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Antidŏsis">Antidosis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀντίδοσις</foreign>). Literally “an exchange.” A term in the language of the Attic courts, peculiarly applied to proceedings under a law which is said to have originated with Solon ( <title>c. Phaenipp.</title> init.). It is natural, however, to refer the law to more democratic times; and the orators were in the habit of ascribing to Solon all laws, 
<pb n="84" /><cb />
 especially those which they happened to be quoting in a favourable sense. By this law, a citizen nominated to perform a liturgia, such as a trierarchy or choregia, or to rank among the propertytax payers in a class disproportioned to his means, was empowered to call upon any qualified person not so charged to take the office in his stead, or submit to a complete exchange of property—the charge in question, of course, attaching to the first party, if the exchange were finally effected. For these proceedings the courts were opened at a stated time every year by the magistrates that had official cognizance of the particular subject; such as the strategi in cases of trierarchy and rating to the property-taxes, and the archon in those of choregia ( <title>c. Phaenipp.</title> p. 1040; Meier, <title>Att. Process</title>, p. 471; <foreign lang="greek">προσκαλεῖσθαι τινα εἰς ἀντίδοσιν</foreign>, Lysias, <bibl n="Aristid. Or. 24" default="NO"> <title>Or.</title>24</bibl>, <title>pro Inval.</title> 10). If the person challenged could prove that he had already discharged the liturgia, or was otherwise lawfully exempted, the magistrates might dismiss the case; otherwise the parties proceeded to a <foreign lang="greek">διαδικασία</foreign> or legal award of their respective claims. An oath was taken by both parties that each would deliver to the other, within three days, a correct inventory (<foreign lang="greek">ἀπόφασις</foreign>) of their respective properties ( <title>c. Phaenipp.</title> p. 1042. 11); but in practice the time might be extended by consent of the challenger. All immovable and movable property was transferred in the exchange, with the exception of mines, which were exempted from the extraordinary taxes and liturgiae, as being already taxed; and all claims and obligations attached to it, and particularly all debts, were included in the transfer, as may be seen from the speech against Phaenippus.</p>
 <p>Professor Mahaffy's remarks on the injustice of this law are by no means too strong: “It seems simply the legislation of the Athenian mob about property which they had never possessed, and did not understand; for the other alternative—that Athenian properties were small or of a simple nature, like our rentals of estates—is refuted by the many descriptions of property in the orators. It is, in fact, inexplicable that any intelligent people should have tolerated such a law, and it is conclusive against the business capacity of the men who tolerated it.” See Mahaffy, <title>Social Life in Greece</title>, p. 409, 3d ed., and Jebb, <title>Attic Or.</title> ii. 135.

When Memnon attacked the aged Nestor , Antilochus threw himself in his way, and bought his father's safety with his life. He, like Patroclus, was avenged by Achilles, in whose grave-mound the ashes of both friends were laid; even in the lower world Odysseus beheld the three pacing the asphodel meadow, and in after-times the inhabitants of Ilium offered to them jointly the sacrifices due to the dead on the foreland of Sigeum.

(See <ref type="cross" target="crosscanon-alexandrinus">Canon Alexandrinus</ref>.) In striving to impart strength and dignity to language by avoiding all that was common, his style became rigid and artificial, and naturally ran into bombast.

(1) <ref type="cross" target="crosssoter">Soter</ref> (reigned B.C. 280-261), the son of Selencus I., the founder of the Syrian kingdom of the Seleucidae. He married his stepmother Stratonicé, with whom he had fallen violently in love, and whom his father surrendered to him. He fell in battle against the Gauls in 261.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Theos</hi> (B.C. 261-246), son and successor of the preceding. The Milesians gave him his surname of <foreign lang="greek">Θεός</foreign> because he delivered them from their tyrant, Timarchus. He carried on war with Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, which was brought to a close by his putting away his wife Laodicé, and marrying Berenicé, the daughter of Ptolemy. After the death of Ptolemy he recalled Laodicé, but, in revenge for the insult she had received, she caused Antiochus and Berenicé to be murdered. He was succeeded by his son Seleucus Callinicus. His younger son, Antiochus Hierax, also assumed the crown, and carried on war some years with his brother. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossberenice">Berenicé</ref>.)</p>
 <p>(3) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Great</hi> (B.C. 223-187), son and successor of Seleucus Callinicus. He carried on war against Ptolemy Philopator, king of Egypt, in order to obtain Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine, but was obliged to cede these provinces to Ptolemy, in consequence of his defeat at the battle of Raphia, near Gaza, in 217. He was afterwards engaged for seven years (212- 205) in an attempt to regain the eastern provinces of Asia, which had revolted during the reign of Antiochus II.; but, though he met with great success, he found it hopeless to effect the subjugation of the Parthian and Bactrian kingdoms, and accordingly concluded a peace with them. In 198 he conquered Palestine and Coele-Syria, which he afterwards gave as a dowry with his daughter Cleopatra upon her marriage with Ptolemy Epiphanes. He afterwards became involved in hostilities with the Romans, and was urged by Hannibal, <figure id="fig.00085">

 who arrived at his court, to invade Italy without loss of time; but Antiochus did not follow his advice. In 192 he crossed over into Greece; and in 191 he was defeated by the Romans at Thermopylae, and compelled to return to Asia. In 190 he was again defeated by the Romans under L. Scipio, at Mount Sipylus, near Magnesia, and compelled to sue for peace, which was granted in 188, on condition of his ceding all his dominions east of Mount Taurus, and paying 15,000 Euboic talents. In order to raise the money to pay the Romans, he attacked a wealthy temple in Elymais, but was killed by the people of the place (187). He was succeeded by his son Seleucus Philopator.</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossepiphanes">Epiphănes</ref> (B.C. 175-164), son of Antiochus III., succeeded his brother Seleucus Philopator in 175. He carried on war against Egypt (171-168) with great success; and he was preparing to lay siege to Alexandria in 168, when the Romans compelled him to retire. He endeavoured to root out the Jewish religion and to introduce the worship of the Greek divinities; but this attempt led to a rising of the Jewish people under Mattathias and his heroic sons, the Maccabees, which Antiochus was unable to put down. He attempted to plunder a temple in Elymais in 164, but was repulsed, and died shortly afterwards in a state of raving madness, which the Jews and the Greeks equally attributed to his sacrilegious crimes. His subjects gave him the name of <title>Epimanes</title> (“the madman”), in parody of <title>Epiphanes.</title></p>
 <p>(5) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Eupator</hi> (B.C. 164-162), son and successor of Epiphanes, was nine years old at his father's death. He was dethroned and put to death by Demetrius Soter, the son of Seleucus Philopator.</p>
 <p>(6) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Theos</hi>, son of Alexander Balas. He was brought forward as a claimant to the crown in 144, against Demetrius Nicator, by Tryphon, but he was murdered by the latter, who ascended the throne himself in 142.</p>
 <p>(7) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sidētes</hi> (B.C. 137-128), so called from Sidé in Pamphylia, where he was brought up, younger son of Demetrius Soter, succeeded Tryphon. He was defeated and slain in battle by the Parthians in 128.</p>
 <p>(8) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Grypus</hi>, or Hook-nosed (B.C. 125-96), second son of Demetrius Nicator and Cleopatra. He carried on war for some years with his halfbrother, Antiochus Cyzicenus. At length, in 112, the two brothers agreed to share the kingdom between them,—Antiochus Cyzicenus having Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and Antiochus Grypus the remainder of the provinces. Grypus was assassinated in 96.</p>
 <p>(9) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Cyzicēnus</hi>, from Cyzicus, where he was brought up, brother of Grypus, reigned over Coele-Syria and Phoenicia from 112 to 96, but fell in battle in 95 against Seleucus Epiphanes, son of Grypus.</p>

In later legend her father is Nycteus of Hyria or Hysiae. As he threatened to punish her for yielding to the approaches of Zeus under the form of a satyr, she fled to Epopeus of Sicyon. This king her uncle Lycus killed by order of his brother Nycteus, now dead, and led her back in chains. Arrived on Mount Cithaeron, she gave birth to twins—Amphion by Zeus, Zethus by Epopeus—whom Lycus left exposed upon the mountain. After being long imprisoned and ill-treated by Dircé, the wife of Lycus , she escaped to Cithaeron, and made acquaintance with her sons, whom a shepherd had brought up. <figure id="fig.00086">

<div2 id="crossantipater" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Antipăter">Antipater</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀντίπατρος</foreign>). (1) The son of Iolaüs, a Macedonian. He was first an officer under Philip, and afterwards was raised to the rank of a general under Alexander the Great. When the latter invaded Asia Antipater was appointed governor of Macedonia, and in this station he served his prince with the greatest fidelity. He reduced the Spartans, who had formed a confederacy against the Macedonians; and, having thus secured the tranquillity of Greece, he marched into Asia with a powerful reinforcement for Alexander. After that monarch's death the government of Macedonia and of the other European provinces was allotted to Antipater. He was soon involved in a severe contest with the Grecian states; was defeated by the Athenians, who came against him with an army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships; and was closely besieged in Lamia, a town of Thessaly. But Leosthenes, the Athenian commander, having been mortally wounded under the walls of the city, and Antipater having received assistance from Craterus, his son-in-law, the fortune of the war was completely changed. The Athenians were routed at Cranon, and compelled to submit at discretion. They were allowed to retain their rights and privileges, but were obliged to deliver up the orators Demosthenes and Hyperides, who had instigated the war, and to receive a Macedonian garrison into the Munychia. Antipater was equally successful in subduing the other States of Greece, who were making a noble struggle for their freedom; but he settled their respective governments with much moderation. In conjunction with Craterus he was the first who attempted to control the growing power of Perdiccas, and after the death of that commander he was invested with all his authority. He exercised this jurisdiction over the other governors with unusual fidelity, integrity, and impartiality, and died in the eightieth year of his age, B.C. 319. At his death he left his son Cassander in a subordinate station; appointed Polysperchon his own immediate successor, and recommended him to the other generals as the fittest person to preside in their councils. Antipater received a learned education, and was the friend and disciple of Aristotle. He appears to have possessed very eminent abilities, and was peculiarly distinguished for his vigilance and fidelity in every trust. It was a saying of Philip, father of Alexander, “I have slept soundly, for Antipater has been awake” (Justin, xi. 12, 13, etc.; <bibl n="Diod.  17. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvii. 18</bibl>, etc.).</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Idumaean</hi>, was the father of Herod the Great, and second son of Antipas, governor of Idumaea. He embraced the party of Hyrcanus against Aristobulus, and took a very active part in the contest between the two brothers respecting the office of high-priest in Iudaea. Aristobulus at first, however, succeeded; but when Pompey had deposed him and restored Hyrcanus to the pontifical dignity, Antipater soon became the chief director of affairs in Iudaea, ingratiated himself with the Romans, <cb /> and used every effort to aggrandize his own family. He gave very effectual aid to Caesar in the Alexandrian War, and the latter in return made him a Roman citizen and procurator of Iudaea. In this latter capacity he exerted himself to restore the ancient Jewish form of government, but was cut off by a conspiracy, the brother of the high-priest having been bribed to give him a cup of poisoned wine. Iosephus makes him to have been distinguished for piety, justice, and love of country (<title>Ant. Iud.</title> xiv. 3).</p>
 <p>(3) A son of Cassander, ascended the throne of Macedonia B.C. 298. He disputed the crown with his brother, Philip IV., and caused his mother, Thessalonica, to be put to death for favouring Philip's side. The two brothers, however, reigned conjointly, notwithstanding this, for three years, when they were dethroned by Demetrius Poliorcetes. Antipater thereupon retired to the court of Lysimachus, his father-in-law, where he ended his days (Justin, xxvi. 1).</p>
 <p>(4) A native of Tarsus, the disciple and successor of Diogenes the Babylonian, in the Stoic School. He flourished about B.C. 144, and is praised by both Cicero and Seneca as an able supporter of that sect. His chief opponent was Carneades ( <title>De Off.</title> iii. 12;  <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 92" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>Ep.</title>92</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(5) A native of Cyrené, and one of the Cyrenaic school. He was a disciple of the first Aristippus and the preceptor of Epitimides.</p>
 <p>(6) A philosopher of Tyre, who wrote a work on duty. He is supposed to have been of the Stoic school. Cicero ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 3. 50" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>De Orat.</title>iii. 50</bibl>) speaks of him as an improvisator. Crassus, into whose mouth the Roman orator puts this remark, might have known the poet when he was quaestor in Macedonia, the same year in which Cicero was born (B.C. 106). Pliny relates ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 7. 51" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>vii. 51</bibl>) that he had every year a fever on the day of his birth, and that, without ever experiencing any other complaint, he attained to a very advanced age. Some of his epigrams remain, the greater part of which fall under the class of epitaphs (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπιτύμβια</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(7) A poet of Thessalonica, who flourished towards the end of the last century preceding the Christian era. We have thirty-six of his epigrams remaining.</p>
 <p>(8) A native of Hierapolis. He was the secretary of Septimius Severus and praefect of Bithynia. He was the preceptor also of Caracalla and Geta, and reproached the former with the murder of his brother.

He was the founder of political eloquence as an art, which he taught with great applause in his own school of rhetoric; and he was the first who wrote out speeches for others to deliver in court, though he afterwards published them under his own name. He also played an active part in the politics of his time as a leading member of the oligarchical party, and the real author of the death-blow which was dealt to democracy in B.C. 411 by the establishment of the Council of Four Hundred. He then went as ambassador to Sparta, to purchase peace at any price in the interest of the oligarchy. On the fall of the Four Hundred he was accused of high treason, and, in spite of a masterly defence —the first speech he had ever made in public— was condemned to death B.C. 411. Of the sixty orations attributed to him, only fifteen are preserved—all on trials for murder; but only three of them are about real cases. The rest (named <hi rend="italic">tetralogies</hi> because every four are the first and second speeches of both plaintiff and defendant on the same subject) are mere exercises.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀντισθένης</foreign>). A Greek philosopher of Athens, born about B.C. 440, but only a half-citizen, because his mother was a Thracian. He was in his youth a pupil of Gorgias, and himself taught for a time as a sophist, till, towards middle life, he attached himself to Socrates, and became his bosom friend. After the death of Socrates, in B.C. 399, he established a school in the gymnasium <foreign lang="greek">Κυνόσαργες</foreign>, the only one open to persons of half-Athenian descent, whence his followers bore the name of Cynici (<foreign lang="greek">Κυνικοί</foreign>). He lived to the age of seventy. Like Socrates, he regarded virtue as necessary— indeed, alone sufficient—for happiness, and to be a branch of knowledge that could be taught, and that once acquired could not be lost, its essence consisting in freedom from wants by the avoidance of evil (by evil meaning pleasure and desire). Its acquisition needs no dialectic argumentation, only Socratic strength. His pupils, especially the famous Diogenes of Sinopé, degraded his doctrine to cynicism by depreciating all knowledge and despising the current morality of the time. His philosophical and rhetorical works are lost, all but two slight declamations on the contest for the arms of Achilles, the <title>Aias</title> and <title>Odysseus;</title> and even their genuineness is disputed.

<head orig="Antonīnus">Antoninus</head>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Pius</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Titus Aurelius Fulvius Boionius Antonīnus</hi>, a Roman emperor, A.D. 138-161, born near Lanuvium, A.D. 86, adopted by Hadrian in 138, and succeeded the latter in the same year. The Senate conferred upon him the title of <title>Pius</title>, or “the dutifully affectionate,” because he persuaded them to grant to his father Hadrian the apotheosis and other honours usually paid to deceased emperors. The reign of Antoninus is almost a blank in history—a blank caused by the suspension for a time of war, violence, and crime. He was one of the best princes that ever mounted a throne, and all his thoughts and energies were dedicated to the happiness of his people. He died in A.D. 161, in his seventy-fifth year. He was succeeded by M. Aurelius, whom he had adopted, when he himself was adopted by Hadrian, and to whom he gave his daughter Faustina in marriage.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Marcus Annius (Verus) Aurelius</hi>, was born at Rome in the year A.D. 121. Upon the death of Ceionius Commodus, the emperor Hadrian turned his attention towards Marcus Aurelius; but he being then too young for an early assumption of the cares of empire, Hadrian adopted Antoninus Pius, on condition that he in his turn should adopt Marcus Aurelius. His father dying early, the care of his education devolved on his paternal grandfather, Verus, who caused him to receive a general education; but philosophy so early became the object of his ambition that he assumed the philosophic mantle when only twelve years old. The species of philosophy to which he attached himself was the Stoic, as being most connected with morals and the conduct of life; and such was the natural sweetness of his temper that he exhibited none of the pride which sometimes attended the artificial elevation of the Stoic character. This was the more remarkable, as all the honour and power that Antoninus could bestow upon him became his own at an early period, since he was practically associated with him in the administration of the Empire for many years. On his formal accession to the sovereignty his first act was of a kind which at once proved his great disinterestedness; for he immediately took Lucius Verus as his colleague, who had indeed been associated with him by adoption, but who, owing to his defects and vices, had been excluded by Antoninus from the succession, which, at his instigation, the Senate had confined to Marcus Aurelius alone. Notwithstanding their dissimilarity of character, the two emperors reigned conjointly without any disagreement. Verus took the nominal 
<pb n="90" /><cb />
 guidance of the war against the Parthians, which was successfully carried on by the lieutenants under him, and during the campaign married Lucilla, the daughter of his colleague. The reign of Marcus Aurelius was more eventful than that of Antoninus. Before the termination of the Parthian War, the Marcomanni and other German tribes began those disturbances which more or less annoyed him for the rest of his life. Against these foes, after the termination of hostilities with Parthia, the two emperors marched; but what was effected during three years' war and negotiation, until the death of Verus, is little known. The sudden decease of that unsuitable colleague by an apoplexy restored to Marcus Aurelius the sole dominion; and for the next five years he carried on the Pannonian War in person, without ever returning to Rome. During these fatiguing campaigns he endured all the hardships incident to a rigorous climate and a military life with a patience and serenity which did the highest honour to his philosophy. Few of the particular actions of this tedious warfare have been fully described; although, owing to conflicting religious zeal, one of them has been exceedingly celebrated. This was the deliverance of the emperor and his army from imminent danger by a victory over the Quadi, in consequence of an extraordinary storm of rain, hail, and lightning, which disconcerted the barbarians, and was, by the conquerors, regarded as miraculous. The emperor and the Romans attributed the timely event to Iupiter Tonans; but the Christians affirmed that God granted this favour on the supplications of the Christian soldiers in the Roman army, who are said to have composed the Twelfth, or Meletine, Legion; and, as a mark of distinction, we are informed by Eusebius that they received from an emperor who persecuted Christianity the title of the “Thundering Legion.” The date of this event is fixed by Tillemont as A.D. 174. The general issue of the war was that the barbarians were repressed, but admitted to settle in the territories of the Empire as colonists; and a complete subjugation of the Marcomanni might have followed had not the emperor been recalled by the conspiracy of Avidius Cassius, who assumed the purple in Syria. This usurper was quickly destroyed by a conspiracy among his own officers, and the clemency shown by the emperor to his family was most exemplary. After the suppression of this revolt he made a progress through the East, in which journey he lost his wife Faustina, daughter of Antoninus Pius, a woman as dissolute as she was beautiful, but whose irregularities he never seems to have noticed—a blindness or insensibility that has made him the theme of frequent ridicule. While on this tour he visited Athens, and, like Hadrian, was initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries. His return to Rome did not take place until after an absence of eight years, and his reception was in the highest degree popular and splendid. After remaining in the capital for nearly two years, and effecting several popular reforms, he was once more called away by the necessity of checking the Marcomanni, and was again successful, but fell ill, at the expiration of two years, at Vindobona, now Vienna. His illness arose from a pestilential disease which prevailed in the army; and it cut him off in the fifty-ninth year of his age and nineteenth of his reign. His death occasioned universal mourning throughout the Empire. <cb /> Without waiting for the usual decree on the occasion the Roman Senate and people voted him a god by acclamation, and his image was long afterwards regarded with peculiar veneration. <figure id="fig.00090">
<head orig="Marcus Aurelius. (Louvre.)">Marcus Aurelius. (Louvre.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Marcus Aurelius was no friend to the Christians, who were persecuted during the greater part of his reign—an anomaly in a character so universally merciful and clement that may be attributed to an excess of pagan devotion on his part, and still more to the influence of the persons by whom he was surrounded. In all other points of policy and conduct he was one of the most excellent princes on record, both in respect to the salutary regulations he adopted and the temper with which he carried them into practice. Compared with Trajan or Antoninus Pius, he possibly fell short of the manly sense of the one and the simple and unostentatious virtue of the other—philosophy or scholarship on a throne always more or less assuming the appearance of pedantry. The emperor was also himself a writer, and his <title>Meditations</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν</foreign>), in Greek in twelve books, have descended to posterity. They are a collection of maxims and thoughts in the spirit of the Stoic philosophy, which, without much connection or skill in composition, breathe the purest sentiments of piety and benevolence. They were jotted down from time to time in his leisure moments, and largely while he was in camp along the Danube during his campaign against the Marcomanni. His theology, in general, seems pantheistic, the key-note being the doctrine of a “natural unity,” including God, nature, and all mankind.</p>
 <p>Marcus Aurelius left one son, the brutal Commodus, and three daughters. Among the weaknesses of this good emperor, his too great consideration for his son is deemed one of the most striking; for, although he was unremitting in his endeavours to reclaim him, they were accompanied by much erroneous indulgence, and especially by an early and ill-judged elevation to titles and honours.</p>

He died shortly afterwards in Crete, and was called <title>Creticus</title> in derision.</p>
 <p>(3) <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>, younger son of the orator and uncle of the triumvir, was expelled from the Senate in B.C. 70, and was the colleague of Cicero in the praetorship (65) and consulship (63). He was one of Catiline's conspirators, but deserted the latter on Cicero's promising him the province of Macedonia. He had to lead an army against Catiline, but, unwilling to fight against his former friend, he gave the command on the day of battle to his legate, M. Petreius. At the conclusion of the war Antony went into his province, which he plundered shamefully; and on his return to Rome in 59 was accused both of taking part in Catiline's conspiracy and of extortion in his province. He was defended by Cicero, but was condemned, and retired to the island of Cephallenia. He was subsequently recalled, probably by Caesar, and was in Rome at the beginning of the year 44.</p>
 <p>(4) <ref type="cross" target="crossmarcus">Marcus</ref>, the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Triumvir</hi>, was the son of Antonius Creticus and Iulia, the sister of Iulius Caesar. He was born about B.C. 83. His father died while he was still young, and he was brought up by Lentulus, who married his mother Iulia, and who was put to death by Cicero in 63 as one of Catiline's conspirators: hence Antony became a personal enemy of Cicero. Antony indulged in his earliest youth in every kind of dissipation, and his affairs soon became deeply involved. In 58, he went to Syria, where he served with distinction under Gabinius. In 54, he went to Caesar in Gaul, and by the influence of the latter was elected quaestor (B.C. 52). He now became one of the most active partisans of Caesar. He was tribune of the plebs in 49, and in January fled to Caesar's camp in Cisalpine Gaul, after putting his veto upon the decree of the Senate which deprived Caesar of his command. In 48, Antony was present at the battle of Pharsalia, where he commanded the left wing. In 44, he was consul with Caesar, when he offered him the kingly diadem at the festival of the Lupercalia. After Caesar's murder, on the 15th of March, Antony endeavoured to succeed to his power. He pronounced the speech <cb /> over Caesar's body, and read his will to the people; and he also obtained the papers and private property of Caesar. But he found a new and unexpected rival in young Octavianus, the adopted son and great-nephew of the dictator, who at first joined the Senate in order to crush Antony. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaugustus">Augustus</ref>.) Towards the end of the year Antony proceeded to Cisalpine Gaul, which had been previously granted him by the Senate; but Dec. Brutus refused to surrender the province to Antony, and threw himself into Mutina, where he was besieged by Antony. The Senate approved of the conduct of Brutus, declared Antony a public enemy, and intrusted the conduct of the war against him to Octavianus. Antony was defeated at the battle of Mutina, in April, 43, and was obliged to cross the Alps. Both the consuls, however, had fallen, and the senators now began to show their jealousy of Octavianus. Meantime Antony was joined by Lepidus with a powerful army; Octavianus became <figure id="fig.00091">
<head orig="Marcus Antonius.">Marcus Antonius.</head>
</figure> reconciled to him; and it was agreed that the government of the state should be vested in Antony, Octavianus, and Lepidus, under the title of <title>Triumviri Republicae Constituendae</title>, for the next five years. The mutual enemies of each were proscribed, and, in the numerous executions that followed, Cicero, who had attacked Antony in his Philippic Orations, fell a victim to his malice. In 42, Antony and Octavianus crushed the republican party by the battle of Philippi, in which Brutus and Cassius fell. Antony then went to Asia, which he had received as his share of the Roman world. In Cilicia he met with Cleopatra , and followed her to Egypt, a captive to her charms. In 41, Fulvia, the wife of Antony, and his brother, L. Antonius, made war upon Octavianus in Italy. Antony prepared to support his relatives, but the war was brought to a close at the beginning of 40, before Antony could reach Italy. The opportune death of Fulvia facilitated the reconciliation of Antony and Octavianus, which was cemented by the marriage of Antony to Octavia, the sister of Octavianus. Antony remained in Italy till 39, when the triumvirs concluded a peace with Pompey, and he afterwards went to his provinces in the East. In this year and the following, Ventidius, the lieutenant of Antony, defeated the Parthians. In 37, Antony crossed over to Italy, when 
<pb n="92" /><cb />
 the triumvirate was renewed for five years. He then returned to the East, and shortly afterwards <figure id="fig.00092">
<head orig="Coin of Antony, struck at ">Coin of Antony, struck at </head>
</figure> Antioch. sent Octavia back to her brother and surrendered himself entirely to the charms of Cleopatra. In 36, he invaded Parthia, but lost a great number of his troops, and was obliged to retreat. He was more successful in his invasion of Armenia in 34, for he obtained possession of the person of Artavasdes, the Armenian king, and carried him to Alexandria. Antony now laid aside entirely the character of a Roman citizen, and assumed the pomp and ceremony of an Eastern despot. His conduct, and the unbounded influence which Cleopatra had acquired over him, alienated many of his friends and supporters; and Octavianus saw that the time had now come for crushing his rival. <figure id="fig.00092.2">
<head orig="Coin of Antony, with Worship of Bacchus and Venus.">Coin of Antony, struck at </head>
</figure> The contest was decided by the memorable seafight off Actium, September 2d, B.C. 31, in which Antony's fleet was completely defeated.

But it is highly probable that the custom of wearing rings was introduced into Greece from Asia, where it appears to have been almost universal ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 195" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 195</bibl>). From Asia Minor to Greece proper the transition of fashion was expeditious, and the signet, now for the first time worn mounted as a finger-ring, came into universal favour among all the Hellenic population. This was a new method for securing the engraved stone; for the original inventors of seal-engraving had worn, and continued to wear down to the very close of their history (even to the date of the Arabian conquest), the cylinder or the conical seal as the ornament of the bracelet or the necklace, etc. We have the express statement of Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 4</bibl>) that the use of the finger-ring was introduced among the Romans from Greece. (See King, <title>Handbook of Engraved Gems</title> [1885], pp. 12, 13.) In the time of Solon seal-rings (<foreign lang="greek">σφραγῖδες</foreign>), as well as the practice of counterfeiting them, seem to have been rather common, for Diogenes Laertius (i. 57) speaks of a law of Solon which forbade the artist to keep the form of a seal (<foreign lang="greek">σφραγίς</foreign>) which he had sold. There are allusions to counterfeit seals in <title>Thesm.</title> 432; and <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 132." default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 132.</bibl>Rings without precious 
<pb n="93" /><cb />
 stones were called <foreign lang="greek">ἀπείρονες, ἄπειροι, ἄλιθοι, ἄψηφοι</foreign>, the name of the gem being <foreign lang="greek">ψῆφος</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">σφραγίς</foreign>, which was set in a bezel (<foreign lang="greek">σφενδόνη, πυελίς, μάνδρα</foreign>, <seg lang="la">funda, pala</seg>). In later times rings were worn more as an ornament, and Suidas says (s. v. <foreign lang="greek">σφραγίς</foreign>) that some regularly loaded their hands with rings. Greek women likewise used to wear rings ( <title>Thesm.</title> frag. 320, 12, Kock), but not so frequently as men. The rings of women appear to have been less costly than those of men, for some are mentioned which were made of amber, ivory, etc. Rings were mostly worn on the left hand and third finger ( <bibl n="Gel.  10. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Gell.x. 10</bibl>), but also on the little finger (Lucian, <title>Dial. Merer.</title> 9, 2). Indeed, Pliny says ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 24" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 24</bibl>) that they were worn first on the third, then on the first, and finally on the little finger; and Macrobius ( <bibl n="Enn.  Sat. 7. 13. 15" default="NO"> <title>Sat.</title>vii. 13. 15</bibl>), quoting CapitoAteius , says that originally they were worn on any finger of either hand. But they do not seem to have been <figure id="fig.00093">
<head orig="Hand from an Etruscan Tomb, wearing Rings.">Hand from an Etruscan Tomb, wearing Rings.</head>
</figure> ever worn on the middle finger (<seg lang="la">digitus infamis</seg>). An Etruscan tomb exhibits rings on the upper joints of the fingers. (See illustration.)</p>
 <p>The Lacedaemonians are said to have used iron rings at all times ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 9" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 9</bibl>). The law does not appear to have ever attempted in any Greek state to counteract the great partiality for this luxury; and nowhere in Greece does the right of wearing a gold ring appear to have been confined to a particular order or class of citizens.</p>
 <p>The custom of wearing rings was believed to have been introduced into Rome by the Sabines, who are described in the early legends as wearing gold rings with precious stones of great beauty ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 11" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 11</bibl>). Florus (i. 5) states that it was introduced from Etruria in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, and Pliny derives it from Greece. At whatever time rings may have become customary at Rome, thus much is certain, that at first they were generally of iron, but often of stone (King, <title>Antique Gems</title>, p. 176, ed. 1860); that they were destined for the same purpose as in Greece—namely, to be used as seals; and that every free Roman had a right to use such a ring. This iron ring was used down to the last period of the Republic by such men as loved the simplicity of the good old times, and it retained its place in the ceremony of betrothal. Marius wore an iron ring in his triumph over Iugurtha, and several noble families adhered to the ancient custom, and never wore gold ones ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.  12" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 12</bibl><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. H. N., 21</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Rings with us are mainly associated with mar<figure id="fig.00093.2">
<head orig="Snake-ring. (British Museum.)">Snake-ring. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> riage, an association borrowed from the Romans. As already mentioned, the <seg lang="la">anulus pronubus</seg> was originally of iron, without a stone, and continued to be so even to a late period ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 12" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 12</bibl>); though Tertullian ( <bibl n="Apul. Apol. 6" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Apol.</title>6</bibl>) says the marriage-ring was the one gold ornament that women wore in the olden times. Wedding-rings with precious stones have been found on ancient figures. <cb /></p>
 <p>The ring of the Roman emperor was a kind of state seal, whose use was sometimes allowed to persons acting as his representatives. The keeping of the imperial seal-ring (<seg lang="la">cura anuli</seg>) was intrusted to a special officer.</p>
 <p>Different families appear to have had distinct seals like our crests—e. g. Galba's family seal represented a dog leaping from a ship; Pompey's ring bore the device of three trophies; Augustus sealed with a Sphinx, afterwards with a head of Alexander the Great, and finally with his own portrait, as did Hadrian. The Empire, in fact, is the grand era of portraits on gems. In the art of engraving figures upon gems, the ancients far surpass the best work of modern artists. See <ref type="cross" target="crossgemma">Gemma</ref>.</p>
 <p>Originally, among the Romans, the men only wore one ring and the women none, except that a married woman wore that received at marriage. Later, the love of luxury led both men and women to cover their fingers with rings. In one of the graves at Kertsch, a woman was found with eight rings. Lucian ( <title>Gall.</title>chap. xii.), ridiculing the rich, speaks of sixteen rings. Martial (xi. 59) tells of a man who wore six on each finger. Some even used different rings for summer and winter, those for the latter season being too heavy for hot weather (Iuv. i. 28, with Schol.). The materials used for rings, as seen by European collections, were iron, lead, zinc, bronze, amber, ivory, silver, and gold. Rings were kept in a box called <seg lang="la">dactyliotheca</seg>—a name also applied to a collector of rings. For earrings, see <ref type="cross" target="crossinauris">Inaures</ref>.

<head orig="Apelles">Apelles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀπελλῆς</foreign>). The most celebrated of Grecian painters, born, most probably, at Colophon in Ionia, though some ancient writers call him a Coan and others an Ephesian. He was the contemporary <cb /> of Alexander the Great (B.C. 336-323), who entertained so high an opinion of him that he was the only person whom Alexander would permit to paint his portrait. We are not told when or where he died. Throughout his life Apelles laboured to improve himself, especially in drawing, which he never spent a day without practising. Hence the proverb, <title>Nulla dies sine linea</title> (<foreign lang="greek">τήμερον οὐδεμίαν γραμμὴν ἤγαγον</foreign>). Of his portraits, the most celebrated was that of Alexander wielding a thunderbolt; but the most admired of all his pictures was the “Aphrodité Anadyomené,” or Aphrodité rising out of the sea. The goddess was wringing her hair, and the falling drops of water formed a transparent silver veil around her form. The original was Campaspé, a mistress of Alexander. For the painting of Alexander a sum of twenty talents (about $21,600) was paid, and the painting itself was hung in the temple of Diana of Ephesus. He painted also a horse; and, finding that his rivals in the art, who contested the palm with him on this occasion, were about to prevail through unfair means, he caused his own piece and those of the rest to be shown to some horses, and these animals, fairer critics in this case than men had proved to be, neighed at his painting alone. Apelles used to say of his contemporaries that they possessed, as artists, all the requisite qualities except one—namely, grace, and that this was his alone. On one occasion, when contemplating a picture by Protogenes, a work of immense labour, and in which exactness of detail had been carried to excess, he remarked, “Protogenes equals or surpasses me in all things but one—the knowing when to remove his hand from a painting.” Apelles was also, as is supposed, the inventor of what artists call glazing. Such, at least, was the opinion of Sir Joshua Reynolds and others. The ingredients probably employed by him for this purpose are given by Jahn, in his <title>Malerei der Alten</title>, p. 150. Apelles was accustomed, when he had completed any one of his pieces, to expose it to the view of passengers, and to hide himself behind it in order to hear the remarks of the spectators. On one of these occasions a shoemaker censured the painter for having given one of the slippers of a figure a less number of ties by one than it ought to have had. The next day the shoemaker, emboldened by the success of his previous criticism, began to find fault with a leg, when Apelles indignantly put forth his head, and desired him to confine his decisions to the slipper, “ne supra crepidam iudicaret.” Hence arose another common saying, <title>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</title> (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35. 10" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxv. 10</bibl>).

<div2 id="crossapellicon" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Apellĭcon">Apellicon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀπελλικῶν</foreign>). A Peripatetic philosopher, born at Teos in Asia Minor, and one of those to whom we owe the preservation of many of the works of Aristotle. The latter, on his deathbed, confided his works to Theophrastus, his favourite pupil and Theophrastus, by his will, left them to Neleus, who had them conveyed to Scepsis, in Troas, his native city. After the death of Neleus, his heirs, illiterate persons, fearing lest they might fall into the hands of the king of Pergamus, who was enriching in every way his newly-established library, concealed the writings of Aristotle in a cave, where they remained for more than 130 years, and suffered greatly from worms and dampness. At the end of this period Apellicon purchased them for a high price. His wish was to arrange them in proper order, and to fill up the lacunae that were now 
<pb n="95" /><cb />
 of frequent occurrence in the manuscripts, in consequence of their neglected state. Being, however, but little versed in philosophy, and possessing still less judgment, he acquitted himself ill in this difficult task, and published the works of the Stagirite full of faults. Subsequently the library of Apellicon fell, among the spoils of Athens, into the hands of Sulla , and was carried to Rome, where the grammarian Tyrannion had access to them. From him copies were obtained by Andronicus of Rhodes, which served for the basis of his arrangement of the works of Aristotle.</p>
 <p>Ritter thinks that too much has been made of this story. On its authority it has even been pretended that the works of Aristotle have reached us in a more broken and ill-arranged shape than any other productions of antiquity. He thinks that the story arose out of some laudatory commendations of the edition of Aristotle by Andronicus, and that it is probable, not to say certain, that there were other editions, of the respective merits of which it was possible to make a comparison. At any rate, according to him, the acroamatic works of Aristotle have not reached us solely from the library of Neleus, and consequently it was not necessary to have recourse merely to the restoration by Apellicon, either to complete or retain the lacunae resulting from the deterioration of the manuscripts.

Her attributes combine, with Hellenic conceptions, a great many features of Eastern, especially Phoenician, origin, which the Greeks must have grafted upon their native notions in very old times. This double nature appears immediately in the contradictory tales of her origin. To the oldest Greeks she was the daughter of Zeus and Dioné (and is sometimes called by that name herself); yet from a very early time she appears as Aphrogenia, the “foam-born” (see <ref type="cross" target="crossuranus">Uranus</ref>), as Anadyomené, “she who rises” out of the sea, and steps ashore on Cyprus, which had been colonized by Phoenicians time out of mind; even as far back as Homer she is Cypris, the Cyprian.

Other names applied to her are Pelagia (from <foreign lang="greek">Πέλαγος</foreign>), Anadyomené (as having risen from the water), Erycina (from Mount Eryx in Sicily), Paphia, and Cypris, besides those mentioned below.</p>
 <p>Again, the common conception of her as goddess of love limited her agency to the sphere of human life. But she was, at the same time, a power of nature, living and working in the three elements of air, earth, and water. As goddess of the shifting gale and changeful sky, she was Aphrodité Urania (<foreign lang="greek">Οὐρανία</foreign>), the “heavenly,” and at many places in Greece and Asia her temples crowned the heights and headlands; for instance, the citadels of Thebes and Corinth, and Mount Eryx in Sicily. As goddess of storm and lightning, she was represented armed, as at Sparta and Cythera; and this, perhaps, explains why she was associated with Ares both in worship and in legend, and worshipped as a goddess of victory.</p>
 <p>The moral conception of Aphrodité Urania as goddess of the higher and purer love, especially wedded love and fruitfulness, as opposed to mere sensual lust, was but slowly developed in the course of ages.</p>
 <p>As goddess of the sea and maritime traffic, especially of calm seas and prosperous voyages, she was widely worshipped by sailors and fishermen at ports and on sea-coasts, often as the goddess of calm, while Poseidon was the god of disturbance. Next, as regards the life of the earth, she was the goddess of gardens and groves, of spring and its bounties, especially tender plants and flowers, as the rose and myrtle; hence, as the fruitful and bountiful, she was worshipped most of all at that season of the year in which her birth from the sea was celebrated at Paphos in Cyprus. But to this, her time of joyful action, was opposed a season of sorrow, when her creations wither and die—a sentiment expressed in her inconsolable grief for her beloved <ref type="cross" target="crossadonis">Adonis</ref> (q.v.), the symbol of vegetation perishing in its prime, a myth derived by the Greeks from the Babylonian worship of Adon or Thammuz, and akin to those of Linus , Hyacinthus, and Narcissus. (See Mannhardt Wald- und Feldkulte, 274 [Berlin, 1886].) In the life of gods and men, she showed her power as the golden, sweetly smiling goddess of beauty and love, which she knew how to kindle or to keep away. She outshone all the goddesses in grace and loveliness; in her girdle she wore united all the magic charms that could bewitch the wisest man and subdue the very gods. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscestus">Cestus</ref>.) Her retinue consisted of Eros (Cupid), the Hours, the Graces, Peitho (Persuasion), Pothos and Himeros (personifications of longing and yearning). By uniting the generations in the bond of love, she became a goddess of marriage and family life, and the consequent kinship of the whole community. As such she had formerly been worshipped at Athens under the name of Pandemos (=all the people's), as being a goddess of the whole country. By a regulation of Solon, the name acquired a very different sense, branding her as goddess of prostitution; and then it was that the new and higher meaning was imported into the word Urania. See <ref type="cross" target="crossmeretrix">Meretrix</ref>.</p>
 <p>In later times, the worship of Aphrodité as the <cb /> goddess of mere sensual love made rapid strides, and in particular districts assumed forms more and more immoral, in imitation of the services performed to love-goddesses in the East, especially at Corinth, where large bands of girls were consecrated as slaves to the service of the gods and the practice of prostitution. And later still, the worship of Astarté (“Star”), the Syrian Aphrodité, performed by eunuchs, spread all over Greece. See <ref type="cross" target="crossaphrodisia">Aphrodisia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmeretrix">Meretrix</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the Greek myths Aphrodité appears occasionally as the wife of Hephaestus. Her love adventures with Ares are notorious. From these sprang Eros and Anteros, Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, and Deinos and Phobos (Fear and Alarm), attendants on their father. By Anchises she was the mother of Aeneas. The chief seats of her worship were Paphos, Amathus, and Idalion (all in Cyprus), Cnidus in Dorian Asia Minor, Corinth, the island of Cythera, and Eryx in Sicily. As mother of Harmonia, she was a guardian deity of Thebes. Among plants, the myrtle, the rose, and the apple were specially sacred to her as goddess of love; among animals, the ram, he-goat, hare, dove, sparrow, and other creatures of amorous nature (the ram and dove being widely current symbols of great antiquity); as sea-goddess, the swan, mussel, and dolphin; as Urania, the tortoise.</p>
 <p>The various myths connected with the name of Aphrodité have inspired many exquisite poems in modern literature. In recent English verse reference may be made to the magnificent Chorus to Aphrodité in Swinburne's <title>Atalanta in Calydon;</title> Hake's <title>Birth of Venus;</title> Morris's Aphrodité in his <title>Epic of Hades;</title> and Rossetti's <title>Ve-</title> <figure id="fig.00096">

 <p>In ancient art, in which Aphrodité is one of the favourite subjects, she is represented in a higher or lower aspect, according as the artist's aim was to exhibit Urania or the popular goddess of love. In the earlier works of art she usually appears clothed, but in later ones more or less undraped—either as rising from the sea or leaving the bath, or (as in still later times) merely as an ideal of female beauty. In the course of time the divine element disappeared, and the presentation became more and more ordinary. While the older sculptures show the sturdier forms, the taste of later times leans more and more to softer, weaker outlines. Most renowned in ancient times 
<pb n="97" /><cb />
 were the statue at Cnidus by Praxiteles (a copy of which is now at Munich), and the painting of Aphrodité Anadyomené by Apelles. Of original statues preserved to us, the most famous are the Aphrodité of Melos (see illustration), now at Paris, and that of Capua at Naples, both of which bring out the loftier aspect of the goddess; and the Medicean Venus at Florence, the work of a late Attic sculptor, Cleomenes, in the delicate forms of face and body that pleased a younger age.

<div2 id="crossapollo" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Apollo">Apollo</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀπόλλων</foreign>). Son of Zeus by Leto (Latona), who, according to the legend most widely current, bore him and his twin-sister Artemis at the foot of Mt. Cynthus, in the island of Delos. Apollo appears originally as a god of light, both in its beneficent and its destructive effects; and of light in general, not of the sun only, for to the early Greeks the deity that brought daylight was Helios, with whom it was not till afterwards that Apollo was identified. While the meaning of his name Apollo is uncertain, his epithets of <title>Phoebus</title> and <title>Lycius</title> clearly mark him as the bright, the life-giving, the former also meaning the pure, the holy; for, as the god of pure light, he is the enemy of darkness, with all its unclean, unhallowed brood. Again, not only the seventh day of the month, his birthday, but the first day of the month, i. e. of each new-born moon, was sacred to him, as it was to Ianus, the Roman god of light; and according to the view that prevailed in many seats of his worship, he withdrew in winter time either to Lycia, or to the Hyperboreans who dwell in perpetual light in the utmost north, and returned in spring to dispel the powers of winter with his beams. When the fable relates that immediately after his birth, with the first shot from his bow he slew the dragon Python (or Delphyné), a hideous offspring of Gaea and guardian of the Delphic oracle, what seems to be denoted must be the spring-god's victory over winter, that filled the land with marsh and mist. As the god of light, his festivals are all in spring or summer, and many of them still plainly reveal in certain features his original attributes. Thus the Delphinia, held at Athens in April, commemorated the calming of the wintry sea after the equinoctial gales, and the consequent reopening of navigation. As this feast was in honour of the god of spring, so was the Thargelia, held at Athens the next month, in honour of the god of summer. That the crops might ripen, he received first-fruits of them, and at the same time propitiatory gifts to induce him to avert the parching heat, so hurtful to fruits and men. About the time of the sun's greatest altitude (July and August), when the god displays his power, both for good and for harm, the Athenians offered him hecatombs, whence the first month of their year was named Hecatomboeon, and the Spartans held their Hyacinthia. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosshyacinthus">Hyacinthus</ref>.) In autumn, when the god was ripening the fruit of their gardens and plantations, and preparing <cb /> for departure, they celebrated the <ref type="cross" target="crosspyanepsia">Pyanepsia</ref> (q.v.), when they presented him with the first-fruits of harvest.</p>
 <p>Apollo gives the crops prosperity, and protection not only against summer heat, but against blight, mildew, and the vermin that prey upon them, such as field-mice and grasshoppers. Hence he was known by special titles in some parts of Asia. He was also a patron of flocks and pastures, and was worshipped in many districts under a variety of names referring to the breeding of cattle. In the story of <ref type="cross" target="crosshermes">Hermes</ref> (q.v.) stealing his oxen, Apollo is himself the owner of a herd, which he gives up to his brother in exchange for the lyre invented by him. Other ancient legends speak of him as tending the flocks of Laomedon and Admetus, an act afterwards represented as a penalty for a fault. As a god of shepherds he makes love to the nymphs, to Daphué (q. v.), to Coronis (see <ref type="cross" target="crossaesculapius">Aesculapius</ref>), and to Cyrené, the mother of Aristaeus, likewise a god of herds. Some forms of his worship and some versions of his story imply that Apollo, like his sister Artemis, was regarded as a protector of tender game and a slayer of rapacious beasts, especially of the wolf, the enemy of flocks, and himself a symbol of the god's power, that now sends mischief, and now averts it. Apollo promotes the health and well-being of man himself. As a god of prolific power, he was invoked at weddings; and as a nurse of tender manhood and trainer of manly youth, to him (as well as the fountain-nymphs) were consecrated the first offerings of the hair of the head. In gymnasia and palaestrae he was worshipped equally with Hermes and Heracles; for he gave power of endurance in boxing, with adroitness and fleetness of foot. As a warlike god and one helpful in fight, the Spartans paid him peculiar honours in their Carneia (q. v.), and in a measure the Athenians in their Boëdromia. Another Athenian festival, the Metageitnia, glorified him as the author of neighbourly union. In many places, but above all at Athens, he was worshipped as Agyieus, the god of streets and highways, whose rude symbol, a conical post with a pointed ending, stood by streetdoors and in court-yards, to watch men's exit and entrance, to let in good and keep out evil, and was loaded by the inmates with gifts of honour, such as ribbons, wreaths of myrtle or bay, and the like.</p>
 <p>At sea, as well as on land, Apollo was a guide and guardian, and there especially under the name Delphinius, taken from his friend and ally the dolphin, the symbol of the navigable sea. Under this character he was widely worshipped, for the most part with peculiar propitiatory rites, in seaports and on promontories, as that of Actium, and particularly at Athens, being also regarded as a leader of colonies. While he was <foreign lang="greek">Ἀλεξίκακος</foreign> (averter of ills) in the widest sense, he proved his power most especially in times of sickness; for, being god of the hot season, and himself the sender of most epidemics and the dreaded plague, sweeping man swiftly away with his unerring shafts, he could also lend the most effectual aid; so that he and his son Asclepius were revered as the chief gods of healing. As a saviour from epidemics mainly, but also from other evils, the <ref type="cross" target="crosspaean">paean</ref> (q.v.) was sung in his honour.</p>
 <p>In a higher sense also, Apollo was a healer and preserver. From an early time an ethical tinge was given to his purely physical attributes, and 
<pb n="99" /><cb />
 the god of light became a god of mental and moral purity, and therefore of order, justice, and legality in human life. As such, he, on the one hand, smote and spared not the insolent offender, Tityus, for instance, the Aloidae, the presumptuous Niobé, and the Greeks before Troy; but, on the other hand, to the guilt-laden soul, turning to him in penitence and supplication, he granted purification from the stain of crime (which was regarded as a disease clouding the mind and crushing the heart), and so he healed the spirit, and readmitted the outcast into civic life and religious fellowship. Of this he had himself set the pattern, when, after slaying the Delphian dragon, he fled from the land, did seven years' menial service to Admetus in atonement for the murder, and, when the time of penance was past, had himself purified in the sacred grove of bay-trees by the Thessalian temple; and not until then did he return to Delphi and enter on his office as prophet of Zeus. Therefore he exacts from all a recognition of the atoning power of penance, in the teeth of the old law of vengeance for blood, which only bred new murders and new guilt. The atoning rites propagated by Apollo's worship, particularly from Delphi, contributed largely to the spread of milder maxims of law, affecting not only individuals, but whole towns and countries. Even without special prompting, the people felt from time to time the need of purification and expiation; and hence certain expiatory rites had from of old been connected with his festivals.</p>
 <p>As the god of light who pierces through all darkness, Apollo is the god of divination, which, however, has in his case a purely ethical significance; for he, as prophet and minister of his father Zeus, makes known his will to men, and helps to further his government in the world. He always declares the truth; but the limited mind of man cannot always grasp the meaning of his sayings. He is the patron of every kind of prophecy, but most especially of that which he imparts through human instruments, chiefly women, while in a state of ecstasy. Great as was the number of his oracles in Greece and Asia, all were eclipsed in fame and importance by that of <ref type="cross" target="crossdelphi">Delphi</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>Apollo exercises an elevating and inspiring influence on the mind as god of music, which, though not belonging to him alone any more than atonement and prophecy, was yet pre-eminently his province. In Homer he is represented only as a player on the lyre, while song is the province of the Muses; but in course of time he grows to be the god, as they are the goddesses, of song and poetry, and is therefore <foreign lang="greek">Μουσαγέτης</foreign> (leader of the Muses) as well as master of the choral dance, which goes with music and song. And as the friend of all that beautifies life he is intimately associated with the Graces. <cb /> <figure id="fig.00099.2">
<head orig="Belvedere Apollo. (Rome, Vatican Museum.)">Belvedere Apollo. (Rome, Vatican Museum.)</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Standing in these manifold relations to nature and man, Apollo at all times held a prominent position in the religion of the Greeks; and as early as Homer his name is coupled with those of Zens and Athené, as if between them the three possessed the sum total of divine power. His worship was diffused equally over all the regions in which Greeks were settled; but from remote antiquity he had been the chief god of the Dorians, who were also the first to raise him into a type of moral excellence. The two chief centres of his worship were the island of Delos, his birthplace, where, at his magnificent temple standing by the sea, were held every five years the festive games called Delia, to which the Greek states sent solemn embassies; and Delphi, with its oracle and numerous festivals. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspythia">Pythia</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosstheoxenia">Theoxenia</ref>.) Foremost among the seats of his worship in Asia was Patara in Lycia, with a famous oracle.</p>

By the influence of these writings the worship of Apollo soon became so naturalized among them that in B.C. 431 they built a temple to him as god of healing, from which the expiatory processions (see <ref type="cross" target="crosssupplicatio">Supplicationes</ref>) prescribed in the Sibylline Books used to set out. In the Lectisternia (q. v.), first instituted in B.C. 399, Apollo occupies the foremost place. In B.C. 212, during the agony of 
<pb n="100" /><cb />
 the Second Punic War, the Ludi Apollinares were, in obedience to an oracular response, established in honour of him. He was made one of the chief gods of Rome by Augustus, who believed himself to be under his peculiar protection, and ascribed the victory of Actium to his aid; hence he enlarged the old temple of Apollo on that promontory, and decorated it with a portion of the spoils. He also renewed the games held near it, previously every two years, afterwards every four, with gymnastic and artistic contests and regattas on the sea. At Rome he reared a splendid new temple to him near his own house on the Palatine, and transferred the Ludi Saeculares (q. v.) to him and Diana.</p>
 <p>The manifold symbols of Apollo correspond with the multitude of his attributes. The commonest is either the lyre or the bow, according as he was conceived as the god of song or as the far-hitting archer. The Delphian diviner, Pythian Apollo, is indicated by the tripod, which was also the favourite offering at his altars. Among plants, the bay, used for purposes of expiation, was early sacred to him. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdaphne">Daphné</ref>.) It was planted round his temples, and plaited into garlands of victory at the Pythian Games. The palm-tree was also sacred to him, for it was under a palm-tree that he was born in Delos. Among animals, the wolf, the dolphin, the snow-white and musical swan, the hawk, raven, crow, and snake were under his special protection; the last four in conuection with his prophetic functions.</p>
 <p>In ancient art he was represented as a longhaired but beardless youth, of tall yet muscular build, and handsome features. Images of him were as abundant as his worship was extensive: there was scarcely an artist of antiquity who did not try his hand upon some incident in the story of Apollo. The ideal type of this god seems to have been fixed chiefly by Praxiteles and Scopas. The most famous statue preserved of him is the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican, which represents him either as fighting with the Pythian dragon, or with his aegis frightening back the foes who threaten to storm his sanctuary. Other great works, as the Apollo Musagetes in the Vatican, probably from the hand of Scopas, show him as a Citharoedus in the long Ionian robe, or nude. The Apollo Sauroctonus (lizard-killer), copied from a bronze statue by Praxiteles, is especially celebrated for its beauty. It represents a delicate youthful figure leaning against a tree, dart in hand, ready to stab a lizard that is crawling up the tree. It is preserved in bronze at the Villa Albani in Rome, and in marble at Paris.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀπολλόδωρος</foreign>). (1) A Greek poet of the New Comedy, born at Carystus, between B.C. 300 and 260. He wrote forty-seven plays, and won five victories. From him Terence borrowed the plots of his <title>Phormio</title> and <title>Hecyra.</title></p>
 <p>(2) A Greek grammarian and historian of Athens, about B.C. 140, a pupil of Aristarchus and the Stoic Panaetius. He was a most prolific writer on grammar, mythology, geography, and history. Some of his works were written in iambic senarii—e. g. a geography, and the <title>Chronica</title>, a condensed enumeration of the most important data in history and literature from the fall of Troy, which he places in B.C. 1183, down to his own time—undoubtedly the most important of ancient works on the subject. Besides fragments, we have under his name a book <cb /> entitled <title>Bibliotheca</title>, a great storehouse of mythological material from the oldest theogonies down to Theseus, and, with all its faults of arrangement and treatment, a valuable aid to our knowledge of Greek mythology. Yet there are grounds for doubting whether it is from his hand at all, or whether it is even an extract from his great work, <title>On the Gods</title>, in twenty-four books. A good edition is Hercher's <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1874)</bibl>.</p>
 <p>(3) A Greek painter of Athens, about B.C. 420, the first who graduated light and shade in his pictures, whence he received the name of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Sciagrăphus</hi> (shadowpainter). This invention entitled him to be regarded as the founder of a new style, which aimed at producing illusion by pictorial means, and which was carried on further by his younger contemporary Zeuxis (Pliny , <bibl n="Plin.

 <p>(4) A Greek architect of Damascus, who lived for a time at Rome, where, among other things, he built Trajan's Forum and Trajan's Column. He was first banished and then put to death under Hadrian, A.D. 129, having incurred that emperor's anger by the freedom of his criticisms. We have a work by him on engines of war, addressed to Hadrian.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀπολλώνιος</foreign>). (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Apollonius Rhodius</hi>. A Greek scholar and epic poet of the Alexandrian Age, born at Alexandria about B.C. 260. A pupil of Callimachus, he wrote a long epic, <title>Argonautica</title>, in four books, in which, departing from his master's taste for the learned and artificial, he aimed at all the simplicity of Homer. The party of Callimachus rejected the poem, and Apollonius retired in disgust to Rhodes, where his labours as a rhetorician and his newly revised poem won him hearty recognition and even admission to citizenship, whence his surname. Afterwards, returning to Alexandria, he recited his poem once more, and this time with universal applause, so that Ptolemy Epiphanes, in B.C. 196, appointed him to succeed 
<pb n="101" /><cb /></p>
 <p>Eratosthenes as librarian. He probably died during the tenure of this office. His epic poem, which has survived, has a certain simplicity, though falling far short of the naturalness and beauty of Homer. Its uniform mediocrity often makes it positively tedious, though it is constructed with great care, especially in its versification. By the Romans it was much prized, and more than once imitated, as by Varro Atacinus and Valerius Flaccus. A valuable collection of scholia upon it testifies the esteem in which it was held by the learned of old. A good edition is that by Seaton, 1888.</p>

 <p>(4) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Apollonius of Tyăna</hi>, in Cappadocia, the most celebrated of the Neo-Pythagoreans, lived after the middle of the first century A.D. By a severely ascetic life on the supposed principles of Pythagoras, and by pretended miracles, he obtained such a hold upon the multitude that he was worshipped as a god, and set up as a rival to Christ. The account of his life by the elder <ref type="cross" target="crossphilostratus">Philostratus</ref> (q.v.) is more romance than history, and offers little to build upon. Having received his philosophical education, and lived in the temple of Asclepius at Aegae till his twentieth year, he divided his patrimony among the poor, and roamed all over the world; he was even said to have reached India and the sources of the Nile. Twice he lived at Rome: first under Nero, until the expulsion of the philosophers; and again in Domitian's reign, when he had to answer a charge of conspiring against the emperor. Smuggled out of Rome during his trial, he continued his life as a wandering preacher of morals and worker of marvels for some years longer, and is said to have died at a great age, the master of a school at Ephesus. Of his alleged writings, eighty-five letters have alone survived.

He is the father of scientific Grammar, having been the first to reduce it to systematic form. His extant works are the treatises on Pronouns, Adverbs, Conjunctions, and the Syntax of the parts of speech, in four books.

<head orig="Apotheōsis">Apotheosis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀποθέωσις</foreign>, <seg lang="la">consecratio</seg>). The enrolment of a human being among the gods, of which the Greeks have an instance as early as Homer, but only in the single case of Leucothea. The oldest notion was that of a bodily removal; then arose the idea of the mortal element being purged away by fire, as in the case of Heracles. There was a kind of deification which consisted in the decreeing of heroic honours to distinguished men after death, which was done from the time of the Peloponnesian War onwards, even in the case of living men. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossheros">Heros</ref>.) The successors of Alexander the Great—both the Seleucidae, and still more the Ptolemies—caused themselves to be worshipped as gods. Of the Romans, whose legend told of the translation of Aeneas and Romulus into heaven, Iulius Caesar was the first who claimed divine honours, if not by building temples to himself, yet by setting his statue among the gods in every sanctuary at Rome and in the Empire, and by having a special flamen assigned to him. The belief in his divinity was confirmed by the comet that shone several months after his death, as long as his funeral games lasted; and under the Second Triumvirate he was formally installed among the deities of Rome, as Divus Iulius, by a decree of the Senate and people. His adopted son and successor Octavianus persistently declined any offer of public worship, but he accepted the title of Augustus (the <figure id="fig.00102">
<head orig="Apotheosis of Antoninus Pius and Faustina. (From the Pedestal of the Column of Antoninus Pius.)">Apotheosis of Antoninus Pius and Faustina. (From the Pedestal of the Column of Antoninus Pius.)</head>
</figure> consecrated), and allowed his person to be adored in the provinces. On his death the Senate decreed divine honours to him under the title of Divus Augustus, the erection of a temple, the founding of special games, and the establishment of a peculiar priesthood. After this, admission to the number of the Divi, as the deified emperors were called, became a prerogative of the imperial dignity. It was, however, left dependent on a resolution of the Senate, moved in honour of the deceased emperor by his successor. Hence it was not every emperor who obtained it, nor did consecration itself always lead to a permanent worship. Empresses were often consecrated, the first being Augustus's wife Livia as Diva Augusta, and even other members of the imperial house. 
<pb n="103" /><cb /></p>
 <p>The ceremony of Apotheosis, used from the time of Augustus, was the following: After the passing of the Senate's decree a waxen image of the dead, whose body lay hidden below, was exhibited for seven days on an ivory bed of state in the palace, covered with gold-embroidered coverlets; then the bier was borne by knights and senators amid a brilliant retinue, down the Via Sacra to the ancient Forum, where the funeral oration was delivered, and thence to the Campus Martius, where it was deposited in the second of the four stories of a richly decorated funeral pile of pyramidal shape. When the last honours had been performed, the pile was set on fire; and, as it burned up, an eagle soared from the topmost story into the sky, as a symbol of the ascending soul.

<div2 id="crossappellatio" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Appellatio">Appellatio</head>

 <p> The Latin term for an appeal to a magistrate to veto the decision of an equal or inferior magistrate. Thus a consul could be appealed to against the other consul, and against all other magistrates except the tribunes; but a tribune against both his colleagues and all other magistrates whatsoever. On the other hand, the <seg lang="la">provocatio</seg> (q. v.) under the Republic was an appeal from a magistrate's sentence to the people as supreme judge. During the imperial period the two processes run into one, for the emperor held united in his person both the supreme judicial function and the plenary power of all magistrates, particularly the tribunician veto, so that an appeal to him was at once an <seg lang="la">appellatio</seg> and a <seg lang="la">provocatio.</seg> This appeal, in our sense of the word, was only permitted in important cases; it had to be made within a short time after sentence was passed, and always addressed to the authority next in order, so that it only reached the emperor if no intermediate authority was competent. If the result was that the disputed verdict was neither quashed nor awarded, but confirmed, the appellant had to pay a fine. As the power of life and death rested with the emperor and the Senate alone, governors of provinces were bound to send to Rome any citizen appealing on a capital charge.

<head orig="Appiānus">Appianus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀππιανός</foreign>). A Greek historian of Alexandria, who lived about the middle of the second century A.D. At first he pursued the calling of an advocate at Rome; in later life, on the recommendation of his friend the rhetorician Fronto, he obtained from Antoninus Pius the post of an imperial procurator in Egypt. He wrote an extensive work on the development of the Roman Empire from the earliest times down to Trajan, consisting of a number of special histories of the several periods and the several lands and peoples till the time when they <cb /> fell under the Roman dominion. Of the twentyfour books of which it originally consisted, only eleven are preserved complete besides the Preface: <title>Spain</title> (book vi.), <title>Hannibal</title> (vii.), <title>Carthage</title> (viii.), <title>Syria</title> (xi.), <title>Mithridates</title> (xii.), the <title>Roman Civil Wars</title> (xiii.-xvii.), and <title>Illyria</title> (xxiii.), the rest being lost altogether or only surviving in fragments. Appianus's style is plain and bald, even to dryness, and his historical point of view is purely Roman. The book is a mere compilation, and is disfigured by many oversights and blunders, especially in chronology; nevertheless the use made by the writer of lost authorities lends it considerable worth, and for the history of the Civil Wars it is positively invaluable.

 <p>A Roman writer of the African Period, born at Madaura, in Numidia, about A.D. 130. Having been educated at Carthage, he went to Athens to study philosophy, especially that of Plato; later, he travelled far and wide, everywhere obtaining initiation into the mysteries. For some time he lived in Rome as an advocate. After returning to Africa, he married a lady considerably older than himself, the mother of a friend, Aemilia Pudentilla, whereupon her kinsmen charged him with having won the rich widow's hand by magic, and of having contrived the death of her son—a charge to which he replied with much wit in his oration <title>De Magia</title> (earlier than A.D. 161). He afterwards settled down at Carthage, and thence made excursions through Africa, delivering orations or lectures. Of the rest of his life and the year of his death nothing is known. Beside the apology above-mentioned, and a few rhetorical and philosophic writings, another work, his chief one, also survives, which was composed at a ripe age, with hints borrowed from a book of Lucian's. This is a satirical and fantastic moral romance, <title>Metamorphoseon Libri XI. (de Asino Aureo)</title>, the adventures of one Lucius, who is transformed into an ass, and under that disguise has the amplest opportunities of observing, undetected, the preposterous doings of mankind. Then, enlightened by this experience, and with the enchantment taken off him by admission into the mysteries of Osiris, he becomes quite a new man. Of the many episodes interwoven into the story, the most interesting is the beautiful allegorical fairy tale of <title>Cupid and Psyche</title>, so much used by later poets and artists. Throughout the book Apuleius paints the moral and religious conditions of his time with much humour and in life-like colours, although his language, while clever, is often affected, bombastic, and disfigured by obsolete and provincial phrases. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> is that published at Rome in 1469; and the most elaborate edition remains that of F. Oudendorp <bibl default="NO">(Leyden, 1786-1823)</bibl>.

 <p> A district which included, in its widest signification, the whole of the southeast of <cb /> Italy from the river Frento to the promontory Iapygium. In its narrower sense it was the country east of Samnium, on both sides of the Aufidus, the Daunia and Peucetia of the Greeks; the southeast part was called Calabria by the Romans. The Greeks gave the name of Daunia to the north part of the country from the Frento to the Aufidus, of Peucetia to the country from the Aufidus to Tarentum and Brundusium, and of Iapygia or Messapia to the whole of the remaining southern part; though they sometimes included under Iapygia all Apulia in its widest meaning. The country was very fertile, especially in the neighbourhood of Tarentum, and the mountains afforded excellent pasturage. The population was of a mixed nature: they were for the most part of Illyrian origin, and are said to have settled in the country under the guidance of Iapyx, Daunius, and Peucetius, three sons of an Illyrian king, Lycaon. Subsequently many towns were founded by Greek colonists. The Apulians joined the Samnites against the Romans, and became subject to the latter on the conquest of the Samnites.

<head orig="Aquae Ductus">Aquae Ductus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑδραγωγία, ὑδραγωγεῖον, ὑπόνομος</foreign>). A water-conduit or aqueduct.</p>
 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>. As nearly all the ancient aqueducts now remaining are of Roman construction, it has been generally imagined that works of this description were entirely unknown to the Greeks. This, however, is an error, since some are mentioned by Pausanias. The Greeks, in fact, at a very early period, had some powers of hydraulic engineering, as is shown by the drainage tunnels of the lake Copa ïs, and the similar works of Phaeax at Agrigentum; and we have an instance of a channel for water being carried through a mountain to supply the city of Samos. The height of the mountain was 150 orgyiae (900 Greek feet); the length of the tunnel was seven stadia (seven eighths of a Roman mile, or about 1420 yards); its section was a square of eight Greek feet. The actual channel for the water was cut below this, and was, if the text is right, thirty Greek feet deep and three wide; the water passed through pipes from a copious spring, and was thus brought to the city ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 60" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 60</bibl>). There are still remains of this tunnel. Müller conjectures that the work was one of those executed by Polycrates. Indeed, many of the Greek water-works appear to date from the age of the Tyrants. See <ref type="cross" target="crossemissarium">Emissarium</ref>. 
<pb n="105" /><cb /></p>
 <p>But from early times, the Greeks, where the needs of a city called for it, constructed underground conduits following the undulations of the surface or carried through the hills by tunnels, and closely resembling the earlier Oriental aqueducts, of which they were probably imitations. Thus the conduit which supplied the acropolis of Thebes was attributed to Cadmus, and the canalization of the mountain torrents round Argos to Danaüs. The Greek aqueducts were usually rectangular channels cut in the rock or constructed of solid masonry, but in the Troad we have an instance of one composed of earthenware pipes (Hahn, <title>Ausgrab. auf der Homer. Pergamus</title>) </p>
 <p>At Athens the rocky part of the city was dependent on cisterns. Two conduits entered the city on the east from the upper course of the Ilissus, which lower down was canalized, and part of its water went to supplement the <title>Enneakrounos</title>, below which an underground conduit ran from the river, repeatedly crossing under its bed, and accessible to use by shafts, and finally carried to the Piraeus. Below the Enneakrounos, a stream from Hymettus was carried over the Ilissus into the city. Later, two large conduits were constructed from Lycabettus on the east and west of that mountain. A system of canals from the Cephissus served to irrigate the olive-woods (E. Curtius, <title>VII Karten von Athen</title>). Finally, Hadrian, near the end of his reign, built an aqueduct of the Roman type, drawing its water from the Cephissus. Among the finest and best preserved of Greek aqueducts are those of Syracuse, which Thucydides (vi. 100) tells us were laid under ground to bring drinking-water into the city, and which are still in use.
 </p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Roman</hi>. The Romans were in a very different position, with respect to the supply of water, from most of the Greek cities. They at first had recourse to the Tiber and to wells sunk in the city; but the water obtained from those sources was very unwholesome, and must soon have proved insufficient. Consequently, to supply the demands of the public baths and the fullers, and later of the growing population, and later still of the <seg lang="la">naumachiae</seg>, they had recourse to public works in order to bring pure water from a considerable distance—from the hills, in fact, which surround the Campagna. The date of the first aqueduct is assigned by Frontinus to the year <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.u.c</hi>. 441, or B.C. 312 (<title>De Aquaed. Urb. Rom.</title> 4); and the number of aqueducts was gradually increased, partly at the public expense and partly by the munificence of individuals, till, in the time of Procopius, they amounted to fourteen; and, even before they were all erected, they might well excite the admiration which Pliny expresses with respect to the Claudian aqueduct ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.  123" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxvi. 123</bibl>). The Roman aqueducts are among the most magnificent structures of antiquity. Some of these were constructed underground; others, latterly almost all, conveyed the water, often for long distances, in covered channels of brick or stone, over lofty arcades stretching straight through hill and valley. They started from a well-head (<seg lang="la">caput aquarum</seg>) and ended in a reservoir (<seg lang="la">castellum</seg>), out of which the water ran in Rome into three chambers, lying one above another, the lowest chamber sending it through leaden or clay pipes into the public fountains and basins, the middle one <cb /> into the great bathing establishments, the uppermost into private houses. Private citizens paid a tax for the water they obtained from these public <figure id="fig.00105">
<head orig="Section of the Aqua Marcia, Tepula, and Iulia, near the Porta San Lorenzo">Section of the Aqua Marcia, Tepula, and Iulia, near the Porta San Lorenzo</head>
</figure> sources. Under the Republic the construction and repair of aqueducts devolved upon the censors, and their management upon the aediles, but from the time of Augustus, upon a special <seg lang="la">curator aquarum</seg>, assisted by a large staff of pipemasters, fountainmasters, inspectors (<seg lang="la">aquarii</seg>), and others, taken partly from the number of the public slaves. The amount of water brought into Rome by its numerous aqueducts, the first of which, the Aqua Appia, was projected B.C. 312, may be estimated from the fact that the four still in use are quite sufficient to supply all the houses, fountains, etc., of modern Rome.</p>
 <p>In the time of Frontinus (A.D. 97) there were in Rome nine aqueducts, of which four were constructed in the time of the Republic and five under the Empire. These were as follows:</p>
 <p>(1) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Appia</hi>, begun by the censor Appius Claudius Caecus (q. v.) in B.C. 312. (See Middleton, <title>Ancient Rome</title>, p. 466.) Its length was 11,190 <seg lang="la">passus</seg>, of which 11,130 were carried under the earth, and the remaining sixty <seg lang="la">passus</seg> on arches, from the Porta Capena to the Porta Trigemina, where it ended. See <bibl n="Liv. 9.29" default="NO" valid="yes">Livy, ix. 29.</bibl></p>
 <p>(2) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Anio Vetus</hi>, commenced by the censor Manius Curius Dentatus in B.C. 272, the expense of its construction being defrayed out of the spoils taken from Pyrrhus. Its source was in the river Anio, above Tibur, ten Roman miles from the city; but, because of its windings, the actual length was forty-three miles, of which length only 221 <seg lang="la">passus</seg> were above ground. There are remains of this aqueduct near the Porta Maggiore.</p>
 <p>(3) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Marcia</hi>, built by the praetor Q. Rex Marcius in B.C. 144, at the cost of 180,000,000 sesterces. It commenced three miles south of the Via Valeria, thirty-six miles from Rome, and its length was some 61,710 <seg lang="la">passus</seg>, of which 7463 were above ground, 6935 being on arches. Vitruvius speaks of the excellence of its water as proverbial (viii. 3. 1). It is still in use.</p>
 <p>(4) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Tepŭla</hi>, built by the censors Cn. Servilius Caepio and L. Cassius Longinus in B.C. 127. It commenced two miles to the right of the tenth mile-stone on the Via Latina. Its water was slightly warm (<seg lang="la">tepida</seg>), hence the name <hi rend="italic">tepula</hi> 
<pb n="106" /><cb />
 applied to it. It was afterwards connected with the Aqua Iulia.</p>
 <p>(5) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Iulia</hi>, built by M. Vipsanius <ref type="cross" target="crossagrippa">Agrippa</ref> (q.v.), in B.C. 33, during his aedileship. Its length was 15,426 <seg lang="la">passus</seg>, of which 7000 were above ground, partly on arches.</p>
 <p>(6) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Virgo</hi>, also built by Agrippa during his aedileship to supply his baths. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">Balneae</ref>.) It began near the eighth mile-stone on the Via Collatina, being in length 14,105 <seg lang="la">passus</seg>, of which 12,865 were underground. It is still in use.</p>
 <p>(7) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Alsietīna</hi>, or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Augusta</hi>, built by Augustus. It extended from the Lacus Alsietinus, which lay 6500 <seg lang="la">passus</seg> to the right of the fourteenth mile-stone on the Via Claudia, a distance of 22,172 <seg lang="la">passus.</seg> Of this length, only 358 <seg lang="la">passus</seg> were on arches. Its water was so bad as to be used only for watering gardens and for the <seg lang="la">naumachiae.</seg></p>
 <p>(8) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Claudia</hi>, begun by the emperor Caligula in A.D. 38. It began near the thirtyeighth mile-stone on the Via Sublacensis, and furnished excellent water. Its length was 46,406 <seg lang="la">passus</seg>, of which 9567 were on arches.</p>
 <p>(9) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Anio Novus</hi>, the longest of all the aqueducts, being nearly fifty-nine miles in length. It was begun by Caligula in A.D. 38, and finished by Claudius in A.D. 52. Of its length, 9400 feet were above ground, some of its arches being 109 feet high. (See Frontin. 15.) Near the city the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Nova united, forming two channels on the same arches.</p>
 <p>It has been calculated that these nine aqueducts supplied the city of Rome with some 332,306,624 gallons of water a day, or about 332 gallons a head. At the present time, forty gallons per head are considered sufficient. After the time of Frontinus two other aqueducts were built.</p>
 <p>(10) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Traiāna</hi>, built by Trajan about A.D. 110, and brought from the Lacus Sabatinus to supply the Regio Transtiberina.</p>
 <p>(11) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Alexandrīna</hi>, built by Alexander Severus in A.D. 226 from a spot between Gabii and Lake Regillus, about fourteen miles from Rome, and intended to supply the baths of Severus. There was also</p>
 <p>(12) The <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aqua Crabra</hi>, originally carried directly through the Circus Maximus from a point near the source of the Aqua Iulia; but its water was so bad that it was abandoned to the people of the Ager Tusculanus, and hence became known as the Aqua Damnata.</p>

<head orig="Aquĭla">Aquila</head>

 <p> (1) A native of Sinopé in Asia Minor. He first applied himself to the study of mathematics and architecture; and the emperor Hadrian, according to Saint Epiphanius, made him a superintendent of public buildings, and gave him charge of the restoration and enlargement of Jerusalem, under its new name of Aelia Capitolina. This commission afforded him an opportunity of becoming acquainted with Christianity, which he subsequently embraced, and received the rite of baptism. Becoming afterwards addicted, however, to judicial astrology, he was excommunicated, and then attached himself to Judaism. Aquila is rendered famous by his Greek version of the Old Testament, which he published A.D. 138. It is the first that was made after the Septuagint translation, and appears to have been executed with great care. Aquila's method was to translate word for word, and to express, as far as this could conveniently be done, even the etymological meaning of terms. Although his version was undertaken with the view of opposing and superseding that of the Septuagint, of which last the churches made use after the example of the apostles, still the Fathers found it in general so exact that they often, in preference, drew their texts from it. St. Jerome, who had at first censured it, afterwards praised its exactness. The Hellenistic Jews preferred it also for the use of their synagogues Some fragments of it are preserved in the <title>Hexapla</title> of Origen. Aquila joined to a second edition of his version some Jewish traditions which he had obtained from the rabbi Akiba, his preceptor. This edition was still more favourably received by the Hellenistic Jews than the previous one had been. The emperor Justinian, however, interdicted the reading of it, on the ground that it only made the Jews more stubborn in error. See Clarke, <title>Succession of Sacred Lit.</title> i. 44.</p>

<head orig="Ara">Ara</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βωμός, ἐσχάρα</foreign>). An altar. With reference to these terms, <foreign lang="greek">βωμός</foreign> properly signifies any elevation; <foreign lang="greek">ἐσχάρα</foreign> (Lat. <seg lang="la">focus</seg>) means an altar for burnt-offerings; <seg lang="la">ara</seg> and <seg lang="la">altare</seg> are often used without any distinction, but properly <seg lang="la">ara</seg> was a structure of less height than <seg lang="la">altare (altus)</seg>, the latter being erected in honour of the superior gods, and the former to the inferior gods, demigods, and heroes. (Cf. Verg. <bibl n="Calp. Ecl. 5. 65." default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Ecl.</title>v. 65.</bibl>) Sacrifices to the infernal gods were not offered on altars, but in cavities dug in the ground and known as <seg lang="la">scrobes, scrobiculi</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">βόθροι, λάκκοι</foreign> (Festus, s. v. <seg lang="la">altaria</seg>).</p>
 <p>In early times, and always in sudden emergencies, altars were made of earth, turf, or stones collected on the spot. Otherwise they were built of masonry or brickwork, as shown in the following illustrations. <figure id="fig.00107">

</figure></p>
 <p>Subsequently a base was added (<foreign lang="greek">βάσις</foreign>), and a corresponding projection at the top (<foreign lang="greek">ἐσχάρις</foreign>) to hold the fire. A movable pan or brazier (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπίπυρον</foreign>) sometimes served this purpose. Altars were either square or round. <figure id="fig.00107.3">

</figure> <figure id="fig.00107.4">
<head orig="Altar (Antium).">Altar (Herculaneum).</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>Vitruvius directs that altars, though differing in elevation according to the rank of the divinities to whom they were erected, should always be lower than the statues (<seg lang="la">simulacra</seg>) before which they were placed. Of the application of this rule we have an example in a medallion on the Arch of Constantine <cb /> at Rome, shown in the annexed illustration. <figure id="fig.00107.5">
<head orig="Altar with Statue of Apollo (Arch of Constantine).">Altar with Statue of Apollo (Arch of Constantine).</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>All altars were places of refuge. The supplicants were considered as placing themselves under the protection of the deities to whom the altars were consecrated; and violence to the unfortunate, even to slaves and criminals, in such circumstances, was regarded as violence towards the deities themselves. It was also the practice among the Greeks to take solemn oaths at altars, either taking hold of the altar or of the statue of the god. Cicero (<title>pro Balb.</title> 5. 12) expressly mentions this as a Greek practice. See K. F. Hermann, <title>Gottesdienst. Alterth.</title>. 17 and 22.

<head orig="Arabia">Arabia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀραβία</foreign>). A country at the southwestern extremity of Asia, forming a large peninsula, of a sort of hatchet shape, bounded on the west by the Arabicus Sinus (Red Sea), on the south and southeast by the Erythraeum Mare (Gulf of Bab-el-Mandeb and Indian Ocean), and on the northeast by the Persicus Sinus (Persian Gulf). On the north or land side its boundaries were somewhat indefinite, but it seems to have included the whole of the desert country between Egypt and Syria, on the one side, and the banks of the Euphrates on the other. It was divided into three parts. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Arabia Petraea</hi>, including the triangular piece of land between the two heads of the Red Sea (the peninsula of Mt. Sinai) and the country immediately to the north and northeast, and called from its capital Petra; while the literal signification of the name, “Rocky Arabia,” agrees also with the nature of the country.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Arabia Deserta</hi>, including the great Syrian Desert and a portion of the interior of the Arabian peninsula.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Arabia Felix</hi>, consisting of the whole country not included in the two other divisions. The ignorance of the ancients respecting the interior of the peninsula led them to class it with Arabia Felix, although it properly belongs to Arabia Deserta, 
<pb n="108" /><cb />
 for it consists of a sandy desert. There is on the west coast a belt of fertile land, which caused the ancients to apply the epithet of Felix to the whole peninsula. The inhabitants of Arabia were of the Semitic race, and hence closely related to the Israelites. The northwest district (Arabia Petraea) was inhabited by the various tribes that constantly appear in Jewish history— the Amalekites, Midianites, Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, etc. The Greeks and Romans called the inhabitants by the name of Nabathaei, whose capital was Petra. The people of Arabia Deserta were called Arabes Scenitae, from their dwelling in tents, and Arabes Nomadae, from their mode of life. From the earliest known period a considerable traffic was carried on by the people in the north (especially the Nabathaei) by means of caravans, and by those on the south and east coast by sea, in the productions of their own country (chiefly gums, spices, and precious stones), and in those of India and Arabia. The only part of Arabia ever conquered was Arabia Petraea, which became under Trajan a Roman province. Christianity was early introduced into Arabia, where it spread to a great extent, and continued to exist side by side with the old religion, Sabaeism, or the worship of heavenly bodies, and with some admixture of Judaism, until the total revolution produced by the rise of Mohammedanism in A.D. 622.

At the request of the Macedonian king, Antigonus Gonatas, at whose court he lived as physician, he wrote, without much knowledge of the subject but guided by the works of Eudoxus and Theophrastus, two astronomical poems, <title>Phaenomena</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Φαινόμενα</foreign>) and <title>Prognostica</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Διοσημεῖα</foreign>) (aspects of the sky and signs of weather). Without genuine poetic inspiration, Aratus manages his intractable material with considerable tact and dignified simplicity. The language, while not always free from stiffness, is

 choice, and the versification correct. The poems enjoyed a high repute with the general public, as well as with poets and specialists, and the great astronomer Hipparchus wrote a commentary on them in four books. The Romans also took pleasure in reading and translating them—e. g. Cicero, Germanicus, and Avienus. Eng. trans. by Poste <bibl default="NO">(London, 1880)</bibl>. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossaratea">Aratea</ref>.) Aratus is mentioned by his contemporary Theocritus in the Sixth and Seventh Idyls, and by St. Paul in his speech (Acts, xvii. 28).

 <p>(2) A Greek patriot, born in Sicyon B.C. 273, who expelled from his native state the tyrant Nicocles, and persuaded his countrymen to join the Achaean League, and in 244 secured the adhesion of Corinth. He afterwards had equal success with other States in southern Greece, so that the League became powerful, exciting the jealousy of the Aetolians, who made war upon it, but were defeated by Aratus aided by Antigonus, and for a time by Philip, nephew of Antigonus. This strong alliance overthrew Cleomenes, king of Sparta. Later, however, Aratus incurred the ill-will of Philip, who destroyed him by poison, B.C. 213. See Plut.

They were chiefly employed in hunting and in the tending of cattle, whence their worship of Pan, who was especially the god of Arcadia, and of Artemis. They were passionately fond of music, and cultivated it with success. The Arcadians experienced fewer changes than any other people in Greece, and retained possession of their country upon the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnesus by the Dorians. After the Second Messenian War the different towns became independent republics, of which the most important were Mantinea, Tegea, Orchomenus, Psophis, and Pheneus. Like the Swiss, the Arcadians frequently served as mercenaries. The Lacedaemonians made many attempts to obtain possession of parts of Arcadia, but these attempts were finally frustrated by the battle of Leuctra (B.C. 371); and in order to resist all future aggressions on the part of Sparta, the Arcadians, upon the advice of Epaminondas, built the city of Megalopolis. They subsequently joined the Achaean League, and finally became subject to the Romans.

<head orig="Arcesilāus">Arcesilaus</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρκεσίλαος</foreign>). (1) Son of Battus, king of Cyrené, who was driven from his kingdom in a sedition, and died B.C. 575. The second of this name died B.C. 550 ( <bibl n="Hdt.  4. 159" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iv. 159</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(2) A philosopher, born at Pitané, in Aeolis, the founder of what was termed the Middle Academy. The period of his birth is usually given as B.C. 316. Arcesilaüs at first applied himself to rhetoric, but subsequently passed to the study of philosophy, in which he had for teachers, first Theophrastus, then Crantor the Academician, and probably also Polemo ( <bibl n="Diog.  4. 24" default="NO">Diog. Laert.iv. 24</bibl><bibl n="Diog.  29" default="NO">Diog. Laert., 29</bibl>; <title>Acad.</title> i. 9). Besides the instructors above named, Arcesilaüs is also said to have diligently attended the lectures of the Eretrian Menedamus, the Megarian Diodorus, and the sceptic Pyrrho. His love for the quibbling of these individuals has been referred to as the source of his scepticism and his skill in refuting philosophical principles. At the same time it is on all hands admitted that of philosophers Plato was his favourite. He seems to have been sincerely of opinion that his view of things did not differ from the true spirit of the Platonic doctrine; nay, more, that it was perfectly in agreement with those older philosophical teachings, from which, according to the opinion of many, Plato had drawn his own doctrines—namely, those of Socrates, Parmenides, and Heraclitus.</p>
 <p>Upon the death of Crantor , the school in the Academy was transferred by a certain Socratides to Arcesilaüs, who here introduced the old Socratic method of teaching in dialogues, although it was rather a corruption than an imitation of the genuine Socratic mode. Arcesilaüs does not appear to have committed his opinions to writing; at least the ancients were not acquainted with any work which could confidently be ascribed to him. Now, as his disciple Lacydes also abstained from writing, the ancients themselves appear to have derived their knowledge of his opinions only from the works of his opponents, of whom Chrysippus was the most eminent. Such a course must naturally be both defective and uncertain, and accordingly we have little that we can confidently advance with respect to his doctrines. According to these statements the results of his opinions would be a perfect scepticism, expressed in the <cb /> formula that he knew nothing, not even that which Socrates had ever maintained that he knew —namely, his own ignorance ( <title>Acad.</title> i. 12). This expression of his opinion implicitly ascribes to Arcesilaüs a full consciousness that he differed in a most important point from the doctrine of Socrates and Plato. But, as the ancients do not appear to have ascribed any such conviction to Arcesilaüs, it seems to be a more probable opinion which imputes to him a desire to restore the genuine Platonic dogma, and to purify it from all those precise and positive determinations which his successors had appended to it. Indeed, one statement expressly declares that the subject of his lecture to his most accomplished scholars was the doctrine of Plato ( <hi rend="italic">Cic. l. c.</hi>); and he would therefore appear to have adopted this formula with a view to meet more easily the objections of the dogmatists. Now if we thus attach Arcesilaüs to Plato, we must suppose him to have been in the same case with many others, and unable to discover in the writings of Plato any fixed and determinate principles of science. The ambiguous manner in which almost every view is therein advanced, and the results of one investigation admitted only conditionally to other inquiries, may perhaps have led him to regard the speculations of Plato in the light of mere shrewd and intelligent conjectures. Accordingly, we are told that Arcesilaüs denied the certainty not only of intellectual, but also of sensuous knowledge ( <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 3. 18" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>De Orat.</title>iii. 18</bibl>).

Born at Paros, he was the son of Telesicles by a slave-woman, but was driven by poverty to go with a colony to Thasos in B.C. 640 or 650. From Thasos he was soon driven by want, and by the enmities which his unrestrained passion for invective had drawn upon him. He seems to have roamed restlessly from place to place, until, on his return to Paros, he was slain in a fight by the Naxian, Calondas. Long afterwards, when this man visited the Delphian temple, the god is said to have driven him from his threshold as the slayer of a servant of the Muses, and refused to admit him until he had propitiated the soul of the poet at his tomb—a story which expresses the high value set on his art by the ancients, who placed him on a level with Homer, Pindar, and Sophocles; for Archilochus had an extraordinary poetical genius, which enabled him to invent a large number of new metres, and to manipulate them with the ease of a 
<pb n="111" /><cb />
 master. He brought iambic poetry, in particular, to artistic perfection. The many misfortunes of his stormy life had bred in his irritable nature a deeply settled indignation, which in poems perfect in form and alive with force and fury, vented itself in bitter mockery even of his friends, and in merciless, unpardonable abuse of his foes. Such was the effect of his lampoons that Lycambes, who had first promised and then refused him his daughter Neobulé, hanged himself and his family in the despair engendered by the poet's furious attacks. Of his poems, which were written in the Old-Ionic dialect, and taken by Horace for his model in his epodes, only a number of short fragments are preserved. The best text of these will be found in the collection of Bergk.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρχιμήδης</foreign>). A remarkable mathematician and inventor, born at Syracuse in B.C. 287. After spending a long time in travel and study he returned to his native city, and there introduced a great number of inventions, among them the endless screw, first used by him in launching large ships; and the so-called Archimedean screw (<seg lang="la">cochlea</seg>), used in draining the fields after the annual inundation of the Nile. During the siege of Syracuse by the Romans (215-212), he invented the catapults which long kept the enemy at bay, being adapted for use at both short and long range. He is said to have set fire to the Roman ships by means of powerful burning-glasses—a story which Buffon in 1777 showed by experiment to be not at all absurd, and which Ball regards as not improbable. He first established the truth that a body plunged in fluid loses as much of its weight as is equal to the weight of an equal volume of the fluid. When Syracuse finally fell, he was slain by the Roman soldiers, who were tempted by the bright metal of his instruments, which they took for gold. Cicero, when quaestor in Sicily (B.C. 75), discovered the tomb of Archimedes (<title>Tusc. Disp.</title> v. 23).

<head orig="Architectūra">Architectura</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιτεκτονία, ἀρχιτεχτονική</foreign>). (I.) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Greek</hi>.—Of the earliest efforts of the Greeks in architecture we have evidence in the so-called Cyclopean Walls surrounding the castles of kings in the Heroic Age of Tiryns, Argos, Mycenae, and elsewhere. They are of enormous thickness, some being constructed of rude, colossal blocks, whose gaps are filled up with smaller stones; while others are built of stones more or less carefully hewn, their interstices exactly fitting into each other. Gradually they begin to show an approximation to buildings with rectan gular blocks. The gates let into these walls are closed at the top either by the courses of stone jutting over from each side till they touch, or by a long straight block laid over the two leaning side-posts. Of the latter kind is the famous Lion Gate at <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref> (q.v.), so called from its two lions standing with their forefeet on the broad pedestal of a pillar, and remarkable as the oldest specimen of Greek sculpture.</p>
 <p>Among the most striking relics of this primitive age are the so-called <foreign lang="greek">θησαυροί</foreign> (treasuries, usually subterranean) of ancient dynasties, the most considerable being the treasure-house of Atreus at Mycenae. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref>.) The usual form of <cb /> <figure id="fig.00111">
<head orig="Gate of Thoricos.">Gate of Thoricos.</head>
</figure> these buildings is that of a circular chamber vaulted over by the horizontal courses approaching from all sides till they meet. Thus the vault is not a true arch. The interior seems originally to have been covered with metal plates, thus agreeing with Homer's descriptions of metal as a favourite ornament of princely houses. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">Domus</ref>.) An open-air building preserved from that age is the supposed Temple of Heré on Mt. Ocha (now Hagios Elias ) in Euboea, a rectangle built of regular square blocks, with walls more than a yard thick, two small windows, and a door with leaning posts and a huge lintel in the southern side-wall. The sloping roof is of hewn flag-stones resting on the thickness of the wall and overlapping each other, but the centre is left open as in the hypaethral temples of a later time.</p>
 <p>From the simple shape of a rectangular house shut in by blank walls we gradually advance to finer and richer types, formed especially by the introduction of columns detached from the wall and serving to support the roof and ceiling. Even in Homer we find columns in the palaces to support the halls that surround the court-yard and the ceiling of the banqueting-room. The construction of columns (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscolumna">Columna</ref>) received its artistic development first from the Dorians, after their migration into the Peloponnesus about B.C. 1000, next from the Ionians—and from each in a form suitable to their several characters. If the simple, serious character of the Dorians speaks in the Doric order, no less does the lighter, nimbler, and more showy genius of the Ionian race appear in the order named after them. By about B.C. 650, the Ionic style was flourishing side by side with the Doric.</p>
 <p>As it was in the construction of temples that architecture had developed her favourite forms, all other public buildings borrowed their artistic character from the temple. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstemplum">Templum</ref>.) The structure and furniture of private houses were, during the best days of Greece, kept down to the simplest forms. About B.C. 600, in the Greek islands and on the coast of Asia Minor, we come across the first architects known to us by name. It was then that Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos, celebrated likewise as inventors of casting in bronze, built the great Temple of Heré in that island, while Chersiphron of Cnosus in Crete, with his son Metagenes, began the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the seven wonders of the world, which was not finished till one hundred and twenty years after. In Greece Proper a vast temple to Zeus was begun at Athens in the sixth century B.C. (see <ref type="cross" target="crossolympieum">Olympieum</ref>), and two 
<pb n="112" /><cb />
 more at Delphi and Olympia—one of the Corinthian Spintharus, the other by the Elean Libon. Here, and in the western colonies, the Doric style still predominated everywhere. Among the chief remains of this period, in addition to many ruined temples in Sicily, especially at Selinus and Agrigentum, should be mentioned the Temple of Poseidon at Paestum (Posidonia) in South Italy, one of the best preserved and most beautiful relics of antiquity. The patriotic fervour of the Persian Wars created a general expansion of Greek life, in which architecture and the sister art of sculpture were not slow to take a part. In these departments, as in the whole onward movement, a central position was taken by Athens, whose leading statesmen, Cimon and Pericles, lavished the great resources of the state at once in strengthening and <figure id="fig.00112">
<head orig="Porch of the Erechtheum at Athens. (Drawing by Boudier.)">Porch of the Erechtheum at Athens. (Drawing by Boudier.)</head>
</figure> beautifying the city. During this period arose a group of masterpieces that still astonish us in their ruins, some in the forms of a softened Doric, others in the Ionic style, which had now found its way into Attica, and was here developed into nobler shapes. The Doric order is represented by the Temple of <ref type="cross" target="crosstheseus">Theseus; the Propylaea</ref> (q.v.), built by Mnesicles; the <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenon">Parthenon</ref> (q.v.), a joint production of Ictinus and Callicrates—while the <ref type="cross" target="crosserechtheum">Erechtheum</ref> (q.v.) is the most brilliant creation of the Ionic order in Attica. See <ref type="cross" target="crossathenae">Athenae</ref>.</p>
 <p>The progress of the drama to its perfection in this period led to a corresponding improvement in the building of theatres. A stone theatre was begun at Athens even before the Persian Wars, and the Odeum of Pericles served similar purposes. How soon the highest results were achieved in <cb /> this department, when once the fundamental forms had thus been laid down in outline at Athens, is shown by the theatre at Epidaurus, a work of Polyclitus, unsurpassed, as the ancients testify, by any later theatres in harmony and beauty. Another was built at Syracuse before B.C. 420. Nor is it only in the erection of single buildings that the great advance then made by architecture shows itself. In laying out new towns, or parts of towns, men began to proceed on artistic principles, an innovation due to Hippodamus of Miletus. See <ref type="cross" target="crosstheatrum">Theatrum</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the fourth century B.C., owing to the change wrought in the Greek mind by the Peloponnesian War, in place of the pure and even tone of the preceding period, a desire for effect became more and more general, both in architecture and sculpture. The sober Doric style fell into abeyance and gave way to the Ionic, by the side of which a new order, the Corinthian, said to have been invented by the sculptor Callimachus, with its more gorgeous decorations, became increasingly fashionable. In the first half of the fourth century arose what the ancients considered the largest and grandest temple in the Peloponnesus, that of Athené at Tegea, a work of the sculptor and architect Scopas. During the middle of the century another of the “seven wonders,” the splendid tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus, was constructed. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmausoleum">Mausoleum</ref>.) Many magnificent temples arose in that time. In Asia Minor, the temple at Ephesus, burned down by Herostratus, was rebuilt by Alexander's bold architect Dinocrates. In the islands the ruins of the Temple of Athené at Priené, of Apollo 
<pb n="113" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00113">

</figure>
 at Miletus, of Dionysus at Teos, and others, even to this day offer a brilliant testimony to their former magnificence. Among Athenian buildings of that age the Monument of <ref type="cross" target="crosslysicrates">Lysicrates</ref> (q.v.) is conspicuous for its graceful elegance and elaborate development of the Corinthian style. In the succeeding age, Greek architecture shows its finest achievements in the building of theatres, especially those of Asiatic towns; in the gorgeous palaces of newly built royal capitals; and in general in the luxurious completeness of private buildings. As an important specimen of the last age of Attic architecture may also be mentioned the Tower of the Winds at Athens. See <ref type="cross" target="crossandronicus">Andronicus</ref>.</p>
 <p>(II.) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Etruscan and Roman</hi>.—In architecture, as well as sculpture, the Romans were long under the influence of the Etruscans, who, though not possessing the gift of rising to the ideal, united wonderful activity and inventiveness with a passion for covering their buildings with rich ornamental carving. None of their temples have survived, for they built all the upper parts of wood; but many proofs of their activity in building remain, surviving from various ages, in the shape of tombs and walls. The latter clearly show how they progressed from piling up polygonal blocks in Cyclopean style to regular courses of squared stone. Here and there a building still shows that the Etruscans originally made vaultings by letting horizontal courses jut over, as in the ancient Greek <foreign lang="greek">θησαυροί</foreign> above mentioned: on the other hand, some very old gateways, as at Volterra and Perugia, exhibit the true arch of wedge-shaped stones, the introduction of which into Italy is probably due to <cb /> Etruscan ingenuity, and from the introduction of which a new and magnificent development of architecture takes its rise. The most imposing of ancient Italian arch building is to be seen in the sewers of Rome constructed in the sixth century B.C. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>.</p>
 <p>When all other traces of Etruscan influence were being swept away at Rome by the intrusion of Greek forms of art, especially after the conquest of Greece in the middle of the second century B.C., the Roman architects kept alive in full vigour the Etruscan method of building the arch, which they developed and completed by the inventions of the cross-arch (or groined vault) and the dome. With the arch, which admits of a bolder and more varied management of spaces, the Romans combined, as a decorative element, the columns of the Greek orders. Among these their growing love of pomp gave the preference more and more to the Corinthian, adding to it afterwards a still more gorgeous embellishment in what is called the Roman or Composite capital. Another service rendered by the Romans was the introduction of building in brick. A more vigorous advance in Roman architecture dates from the opening of the third century B.C., when they began making great military roads and aqueducts. In the first half of the second century they built, on Greek models, the first basilica, which, besides its practical utility, served to embellish the Forum. Soon after the middle of the century appeared the first of their more ambitious temples in the Greek style. There is simple grandeur in the ruins of the <ref type="cross" target="crosstabularium">Tabularium</ref> (q.v.), or Record Office, built B.C. 78 on the slope of the Capitol next the Forum. These are among the few remains of Roman republican architecture; but in the last decades of the Republic simplicity gradually disappeared, and men were eager to display a princely pomp in public and private buildings; witness the first stone theatre erected by Pompey as early as B.C. 55. Then all that went before was eclipsed by the vast works undertaken by Caesar—the Theatre, Amphitheatre, Circus, Basilica Iulia, Forum Caesaris with its temple to Venus Genetrix. These were finished by Augustus, under whom Roman architecture seems to have reached its culminating-point. Augustus, aided by his son-in-law Agrippa, a man who understood building, not only 
<pb n="114" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00114">
<head orig="Arch of Titus at Rome.">Arch of Titus at Rome.</head>
</figure>
 completed his uncle's plans, but added many magnificent structures—the Forum Augusti with its temple to Mars Ultor, the Theatre of Marcellus with its Portico of Octavia, the Mausoleum, and others. Augustus could fairly boast that “having found Rome a city of brick, he left it a city of marble.” The grandest monument of that age, and one of the loftiest creations of Roman art in general, is the <ref type="cross" target="crosspantheon">Pantheon</ref> (q.v.), built by Agrippa, adjacent to, but not connected with, his Thermae, the first of the many works of that kind in Rome. This structure is remarkable as being the only ancient building in Rome of which the walls and arches are now in a complete state of preservation. It was erected by Agrippa in B.C. 27, the original inscription being still retained upon the architrave of its porch. The Pantheon is a circular structure 146 feet and 6 inches in height and inner diameter, with a portico 103 feet long composed of sixteen Corinthian columns, 46 feet in height. Inside the portico at the entrance are two niches which once contained the colossal statues of Agrippa the builder, and of Augustus Caesar. The walls of the building, which are 19 feet thick, support a dome or cupola of vast dimensions, constructed of concrete. At the vertex of the cupola is an opening nearly 30 feet in diameter, lighting the interior.</p>
 <p>A still more splendid aspect was imparted to the city by the rebuilding of the old town burned down in Nero's fire, and by the “Golden House” of Nero, a gorgeous pile, the like of which was never seen before, but which was destroyed on the violent death of its creator. The immense and complicated structure, or rather mass of structures, known as the Palace of the Caesars, formed one of the most striking achievements of Roman architectural genius. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosspalatium">Palatium</ref>.) It was, as Professor Lanciani puts it, a labyrinth of “endless suites of apartments, halls, terraces, porticoes, crypts, and cellars,” having its main approach on the Via Sacra. At its <cb /> arched entrance was a magnificent quadriga cut from a single block of white marble by Lysias. Beyond was a peristyle of fifty-two fluted columns adorned with a host of exquisite statues representing the Danaïdae, and adjacent to a great library. The magnificence of the palace as a whole may be conjectured from a simple summary of the treasures which we know to have been lavished upon the mere vestibule—a hundred and twenty columns of marble and bronze, statuary, bas-reliefs by Bupalus and Anthermus, a quadriga in gilded bronze, exquisite ivory carvings, hundreds of medallions in gold, silver, and bronze, immense collections of gold and silver plate, gems and cameos, and a colossal bronze statue of Augustus, fifty feet in height. (See Lanciani, <title>Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries</title>, ch. v.).</p>
 <p>Of the luxurious grandeur of private buildings we have ocular proof in the dwelling-houses of Pompeii, a petty country town in comparison with Rome. The progress made under the Flavian emperors is evidenced by Vespasian's amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum, the mightiest Roman ruin in the world; by the ruined Thermae, or Baths, of Titus, and by his triumphal arch, the oldest specimen extant in Rome of this class of monument, itself a creation of the Roman mind. But all previous buildings were surpassed in size and splendour when Trajan's architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, raised the Forum Traianum with its huge Basilica Ulpia and the still surviving Column of Trajan, besides other magnificent structures, including libraries, a great temple, a two-storied gallery, and a triumphal arch. The Basilica had five halls, the central one being 27 yards long, and the whole structure 61 yards wide. It was paved with slabs of rare marble. Only a part of this Forum has yet been excavated, but enough has been brought to light to justify the vivid description of Ammianus Marcellinus (xvi. 10), whose account refers to the time of the emperor Constantine's visit to Rome in the year 356. No less extensive were the works of Hadrian, who, besides adorning Athens with many magnificent buildings, bequeathed to Rome a Temple of Venus and Roma, the most colossal of all Roman temples (see p. 763), and his own <ref type="cross" target="crossmausoleum">Mausoleum</ref> (q.v.), the core of which is preserved in the Castle of St. <figure id="fig.00114.2">

But outside of Rome and Italy, in every part of the enormous Empire to its utmost barbarian borders, bridges, numberless remains of roads and aqueducts and viaducts, ramparts and gateways, palaces, villas, marketplaces and judgment-halls, baths, theatres, amphitheatres, and temples, attest the versatility, majesty, and solidity of Roman architecture, most of whose creations only the rudest shocks have been able to destroy.

<head orig="Archōn">Archon</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων</foreign>). “Ruler.” The Athenian name for the supreme authority established on the abolition of royalty. On the death of the last king, Codrus, B.C. 1068, the headship of the state for life was bestowed on his son Medon and his descendants under the title of Archon. In B.C. 752 their term of office was reduced to ten years; in 714 their exclusive privilege was abolished, and the right to hold the office thrown open to all the nobility, while its duration was diminished to one year; finally in B.C. 683 the power was divided among nine Archons. By Solon's legislation his wealthiest class, the <foreign lang="greek">πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι</foreign>, became eligible to the office; and by Aristides' arrangement after the Persian Wars, it was thrown open to the whole body of citizens, Clisthenes having previously, in the interests of the democracy, substituted the drawing of lots for election by vote. The political power of the office, having steadily decreased with time, sank to nothing when democracy was established; its holders had no longer even the right to deliberate and originate motions, their action being limited to certain priestly and judicial functions, relics of their once regal power.</p>
 <p>The titles and duties of the several archons were as follows: (1) Their president, named emphatically Archon or Archon Eponymus (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος</foreign>) because the civil year was named after him. He had charge of the Great Dionysia, the Thargelia, the embassies to festivals (<foreign lang="greek">θεωρίαι</foreign>), and the nomination of choregi; also the position of guardianin-chief, and the power to appoint guardians; the presidency in all suits about family rights (such as questions of divorce or inheritance), and in disputes among the choregi. <cb /></p>
 <p>(2) The Archon Basileus (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων βασιλεύς</foreign>), called so because on him devolved certain sacred rites inseparably connected with the name of king. He had the care of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and was obliged therefore to be an initiated person; of the Lenaea and Anthesteria; of gymnastic contests, over which he appointed a superintendent; and of a number of antiquated sacrifices, some of which fell to the share of his wife, the <foreign lang="greek">βασίλισσα</foreign> (queen); and lastly, the position of president in all suits touching religious law, including those trials for murder that came within the jurisdiction of the <ref type="cross" target="crossephetae">Ephetae</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>(3) The Archon Polemarchos (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρχων πολέμαρχος</foreign>, leader in war) was originally intrusted with the war department, and as late as the battle of Marathon had the right of voting with the ten generals, and the old royal privilege of commanding the right wing. After wards he only had charge of the state sacrifices offered to the gods of war and to the shade of Harmodius; the public funerals of those who fell in war, and the annual feasts in honour of them; and finally, jurisdiction in all questions concerning the personal and family rights of resident aliens (<foreign lang="greek">μέτοικοι</foreign>) and strangers. All this rested on the old assumption that foreigner meant enemy. Each of these three superior archons had two assessors chosen by himself, but respousible.</p>
 <p>(4) The six Thesmothetae (<foreign lang="greek">θεσμοθέται</foreign>, law-givers) administered justice in all cases not pertaining to the senior archons or some other authority, revised the laws once a year, and superintended the apportioning of public offices by lot. The several archons exercised their jurisdiction at different places in the city; that of the Polemarch alone lay outside the walls. Duties common to all nine were: the yearly appointment by lot of the <ref type="cross" target="crossheliastae">Heliastae</ref> (q.v.), the choice of umpires in the Panathenaea, the holding of elections of the generals and other military officers, jurisdiction in the case of officials suspended or deposed by the people, and latterly even in suits which had previously been subject to the <hi rend="italic">nautodicae.</hi> (See <ref type="cross" target="crossnautodicae">Nautodicae</ref>.) If they had discharged their office without blame they entered the Areopagus as members for life. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossareopagus">Areopagus</ref>.) The office of archon lasted even under the Roman rule.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄρκτος</foreign>). “The Bear.” The name of two constellations near the North Pole.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Lesser</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Little Bear</hi> (<title>Ursa Minor</title>), likewise called the <hi rend="SmallCaps">Wagon</hi> and <ref type="cross" target="crosscynosura">Cynosura</ref> (dog's tail) from the resemblance of the constellation to the upturned curl of a dog's tail. The constellation before the Great Bear was called <title>Boötes, Arctophylax</title>, or <title>Arcturus.</title> At a later time <title>Arctophylax</title> became the general name of the constellation, and the word <title>Arcturus</title> was confined to the chief star in it. All these constellations are connected in mythology with the Arcadian nymph Callisto, the daughter of Lycaon. Metamorphosed by Zeus upon the earth into a she-bear, Callisto was pursued by her son Arcas in the chase, and when he was on the point of killing her, Zeus placed them both among the stars—Callisto becoming the Great Bear, and Arcas the Little Bear or Boötes. In the poets the epithets of these stars have constant reference to the family and country of Callisto: thus we find them called <title>Lycaonis Arctos; Maenalia Arctos</title> and <title>Maenalis Ursa</title> (from Mt. Maenalus in Arcadia); <title>Erymanthis Ursa</title> (from Mt. Erymanthus in Arcadia); <title>Parrhasides Stellae</title> (from the Arcadian town Parrhasia). (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscallisto">Callisto</ref>.) Though most traditions identified Boötes with Arcas, others pronounced him to be Icarus or his daughter Erigoné.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">βιός, τόξον</foreign>). The bow used for shooting arrows. Two kinds of bow were known to antiquity. One consisted of the two horns of the antelope, or an arm of wood similarly shaped, joined by a bridge which served both as a hold for the hand and as a rest for the arrow. The string, made of plaited horse-hair or twisted ox-gut, was fastened to each end (fig. 1). The other, called the Scythian or Parthian bow, was made of a piece of flexible wood, the ends of which were tipped with metal, and bent slightly upwards to hold the string (fig. 2). The arrow (Gr. <foreign lang="greek">ὀϊστός</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">τόξευμα</foreign>; Lat. <seg lang="la">sagitta</seg>) was made of a stem of reed or light wood, one end furnished with a three-cornered point, sometimes simple and sometimes barbed, the other end with feathers. A notch in the shaft served to place it on the string. The arrows (and sometimes the bow) were kept in a quiver (<foreign lang="greek">φαρέτρη</foreign>, <seg lang="la">pharetra</seg>) <cb /> made of leather, wood, or metal, fitted with a suspender, and sometimes open, sometimes having a lid. The quiver was worn either on the back, according to the Greek manner, or in Oriental fash<figure id="fig.00116.2">

<head orig="Arcus">Arcus</head>

 <p> (<seg lang="la">fornix</seg>, <foreign lang="greek">καμάρα</foreign>). An arch suspended over the head of an aperture, or carried from one side of a wall to another, and serving as the roof or ceiling to the space below. An arch is formed of a series of wedge-like stones or of bricks, supporting each other, and all bound firmly together by the pressure of the centre one upon them, which latter is therefore distinguished by the name of keystone.</p>
 <p>It would seem, at first sight, that the arch, as thus defined, and as used by the Romans, was not known to the Greeks in the early periods of their history, otherwise a language so copious as theirs, and of such ready application, would not have wanted a name properly Greek by which to distinguish it. 
<pb n="117" /><cb />
 The use of both arches and vaults appears, however, to have been known to them even before the Trojan War, and its use is exemplified in two of the earliest buildings now remaining—the chamber built at Orchomenus by Minyas, king of Boeotia (Pausan. ix. 38), and the treasury of Atreus at Mycenae (Pausan. ii. 16). Both of these works are constructed underground, and each of them consists of a circular chamber formed by regular courses of stones laid horizontally over each other, each course projecting towards the interior, and beyond the one below it, till they meet in an apex over the centre, and thus resemble the inside of a dome. Each of the horizontal courses of stones formed a perfect circle, or two semicircular arches joined together, as the subjoined plan will render evident. See Schliemann, <title>Mycenae</title>, p. 43; Leake, <title>Morea</title>, ii. 377; and the articles <ref type="cross" target="crossarchitectura">Architectura</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmycenae">Mycenae</ref>. <figure id="fig.00117">
<head orig="Circular Masonry at Mycenae.">Circular Masonry at Mycenae.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The principle of the construction is that of an arch-shaped mass resisting a great superincumbent weight, and deriving its strength and coherence from the weight itself. Thus it seems that the Greeks did understand the constructive principle on which the arch is formed. They made use of a contrivance, even before the Trojan War, by which they were enabled to gain all the advantages of our archway in making corridors, or hollow galleries, and which in appearance resembled the pointed arch, such as is now termed Gothic. This was effected by cutting away the superincumbent stones in the manner already described, at an angle <figure id="fig.00117.2">
<head orig="Pointed Arch in the Walls of Tiryns.">Pointed Arch in the Walls of Tiryns.</head>
</figure> <cb /> of forty-five degrees with the horizon. The mode of construction and appearance of such arches are represented in the annexed drawing of the walls of Tiryns from Sir William Gell's <title>Argolis.</title></p>
 <p>The principle of the true arch was known to the Egyptians, but it is remarkable that they did not make use of it in their most massive works <bibl default="NO">(Wilkinson, ii. 299, ed. of 1878)</bibl>. The Assyrians used it in subterranean buildings (Layard, <title>Nineveh</title>, i. 167; ii. 260). There are also a few specimens of the true arch in ancient Greece. At Oeniadae, in Acarnania, is a postern of a perfect arch in the polygonal walls of the city (Leake, <title>Northern Greece</title>, iii. 560 seq.); and at Xerokampo, in the neighbourhood of Sparta, is a bridge on the true arch-principle (Mure, <title>Tour in Greece</title>, ii. 248), though the latter, in the opinion of many archaeologists, is of Roman construction (Dennis, <title>Etruria</title>, ii. 250 seq.). But these are rare instances; and the Etruscans are the first people who employed the true arch extensively. Hence the use of the arch passed into the architecture of buildings. The Romans probably borrowed it from the Etruscans. Thus the Cloaca Maxima, long held to be the oldest instance of the arch at Rome, and attributed to the Tarquinii (see <ref type="cross" target="crosscloaca">Cloaca</ref>), closely resembles the canal of the Marta (Dennis, <title>Etruria</title>, i. 430 seq.) See pp. 373 and 628.

<div2 id="crossarcus-triumphalis" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Arcus Triumphālis">Arcus Triumphalis</head>

 <p> A triumphal arch. These arches were peculiar to the Romans, and were usually detached structures built across the principal streets of the city, and, according to the space of their respective localities, consisted of either a single archway, or of a central one for carriages, with two smaller ones on each side for foot-passengers, which sometimes had side communications with the central arch. Sometimes there were two arches of equal height, side by side. Each front was ornamented with trophies and bas-reliefs, which were also placed on the sides of the passages. Both façades had usually columns against the piers, supporting an entablature, surmounted by a lofty attica, on the front of which was the inscription, and on the top of it bronze chariots, war-horses, statues, and trophies. The triumphal arch recalls its original, the city gate, in the concentration of ornament on the façades, while the sides, which in the city gate are buried in the wall, are comparatively plain.</p>
 <p>Stertinius is the first upon record who erected anything of the kind. He built an arch in the Forum Boarium, about B.C. 196, and another in the Circus Maximus, each of which was surmounted by gilt statues. Six years afterwards, Scipio Africanus built another on the Clivus Capitolinus, on which he placed seven gilt statues and two figures of horses; and in B.C. 121, Fabius Maximus built a fourth in the Via Sacra, which is called by Cicero the Fornix Fabianus. None of these remain, the Arch of Augustus at Rimini being one of the earliest among those still standing.</p>
 <p>There are twenty-one arches recorded by different writers as having been erected in the city of Rome, five of which still remain: (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Arcus Drusi</hi>, which was erected to the honour of Claudius Drusus on the Appian Way.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄρειος πάγος</foreign>). The hill of <ref type="cross" target="crossares">Ares</ref> (q.v.). A rocky eminence lying to the west of the Athenian Acropolis. To account for the name, various stories were told. Thus, some said that it was so called from the Amazons, the daughters of Ares, having encamped there when they attacked Athens; others again, as Aeschylus, from the sacrifices there offered by them to that god; while the more received opinion connected the name with the legend of Ares having been brought to trial there by Poseidon for the murder of his son, <ref type="cross" target="crosshalirrhothius">Halirrhothius</ref> (q.v.).</p>

<head orig="Ares">Ares</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄρης</foreign>). The Greek name for the god of war, son of Zeus by Heré, whose quarrelsome temper Homer supposes to have passed over to her son so effectively that he delighted in nothing but battle and bloodshed. His insatiable thirst for blood makes him hateful to his father and to all the gods, especially Athené. His favourite haunt <figure id="fig.00119.3">

 is the land of the wild and warlike Thracians. In form and equipment the ideal of warlike heroes, he advances, according to Homer, now on foot, now in a chariot drawn by magnificent steeds, attended by his equally bloodthirsty sister Eris (strife), his sons Deimos and Phobos (fear and fright), and Enyo, the goddess of battle and waster of cities (he himself being called Enyalios), rushing in blind rage through indiscriminate slaughter. Though fighting on the Trojan side, the bloodshed only is dear to his heart. But his unbridled strength and blind valour turn to his disadvantage, and always bring about his defeat in the presence of Athené, the goddess of ordered battalions; he is also beaten by heroes fighting under her leadership, as by Heracles in the contest with Cycnus, and by Diomede before Troy. And this view of Ares as the bloodthirsty god of battles is, in the main, that of later times also. As early as Homer he is the friend and lover of Aphrodité, who has borne him Eros and Anteros, Deimos and Phobos, as well as Harmonia, wife of Cadmus the founder of Thebes, where both goddesses were worshipped as ancestral deities. He is not named so often as the gods of peace; but, as Ares or Enyalius, he was doubtless worshipped every<figure id="fig.00120">

</figure> where, notably in Sparta, in Arcadia, and (as the father of Oenomaüs) in Elis. At Sparta young dogs were sacrificed to him under the title of Theritas. At Athens the ancient site of a high court of justice, the <ref type="cross" target="crossareopagus">Areopagus</ref> (q.v.), was consecrated to him. There, in former days, the Olympian gods had sat in judgment on him and absolved him when he had slain Halirrhothius for offering violence to Alcippé, his daughter by Agraulos. <cb /> His symbols were the spear and the burning torch. Before the introduction of trumpets, two priests of Ares, marching in front of the armies, hurled the torch at the foe as the signal of battle.</p>
 <p>In works of art he was represented as a young and handsome man of strong, sinewy frame, his hair in short curls, and a somewhat sombre look in his countenance; in the early style he is bearded and in armour, in the later beardless and with only the helmet on. He is often represented in company with Aphrodité, and their boy Eros, who plays with his father's arms. One of the most famous statues extant is that in the Villa Ludovisi given above, which displays him in an easy resting attitude, with his arms laid aside, and Eros at his feet.

 <p>The name <hi rend="italic">argei</hi> was also given to certain figures thrown into the Tiber from the Sublician Bridge, on the Ides of May in every year.

<head orig="Argentum">Argentum</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄργυρος</foreign>). Silver. The Athenians obtained their silver from the silver mines at Laurium, which were generally regarded as the chief source of the wealth of Athens. We learn from Xenophon that these mines had been worked in remote antiquity; and Xenophon speaks of them as if he considered them inexhaustible. In the time of Demosthenes, however, the profit arising from them had greatly diminished; and in the second century of the Christian era they were no longer worked. The ore from which the silver was obtained was called “silver earth” (<foreign lang="greek">ἀργυρῖτις γῆ</foreign>, or simply <foreign lang="greek">ἀργυρῖτις</foreign>). The same term (<seg lang="la">terra</seg>) was also applied to the ore by the Romans, who obtained most of their silver from Spain. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaelatura">Caelatura</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossmetallum">Metallum</ref>.</p>
 <p>The relative value of gold and silver differed considerably at different periods in Greek and Roman history. Herodotus mentions it as 1 to 13; Plato as 1 to 12; Menander as 1 to 10; and Livy as 1 to 10, about B.C. 189. According to Suetonius, Iulius Caesar, on one occasion, exchanged gold for silver in the proportion of 1 to 9; but the most usual proportion under the early Roman emperors was about 1 to 12; and from Constantine to Justinian about 1 to 14, or 1 to 15.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀργοναῦται</foreign>). A name given to those who sailed in the ship Argo under the lead of <ref type="cross" target="crossiason">Iason</ref> (q.v.), son of Aeson, a generation before the Trojan War, to Aea, afterwards identified with Colchis at the eastern end of the Euxine Sea. The expedition was undertaken for the recovery of the golden fleece of the ram on which Phrixus, son of <ref type="cross" target="crossathamas">Athamas</ref> (q.v.), had fled from his father and Ino, his step-mother, to the court of Aeëtes, king of Aea, a mighty magician. Having been hospitably received by him, and married to his daughter Chalciopé, he had sacrificed the ram, and hung its fleece up in the grove of Ares, where it was guarded by a sleepless dragon. The task of bringing it back was laid upon Iason by his uncle Pelias, son of Poseidon and Tyro, who had deprived his half-brother Aeson of the sovereignty of Iolcus in Thessaly. Aeson, to protect his son from the plots of Pelias, had conveyed him secretly to the centaur Chiron on Mount Pelion, who brought him up until he was twenty years of age. Then Iason came home, and without a shoe on his left foot, having lost it in wading through a mountain torrent, presented himself before Pelias, demanding his father's restoration to his sovereignty. The crafty Pelias, whom an oracle had warned against a one-shoed man, promised on his oath to do what he asked, if Iason would go instead of himself to bring the golden fleece. This task the oracle had imposed upon himself, but he was too old to perform it. Another 
<pb n="122" /><cb />
 version of the story is, that Iason, after completing his education with Chiron, preferred to live in the country; that he came, with one shoe on, to a sacrifice that Pelias was offering to Poseidon on the sea-shore; that Pelias asked him what he would do if he were king and had been forewarned of his death at the hand of a subject; and that, upon Iason answering that he would make him bring the golden fleece, Pelias gave him the commission. Heré had put that answer into Iason's mouth, because she regarded him with favour, and wished to punish Pelias for having slain Sidero in her temple. See <ref type="cross" target="crosssalmoneus">Salmoneus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The vessel for the voyage, the fifty-oared Argo, is said to have been named after its builder Argos, a son of Phrixus after his return to Orchomenus, the home of his fathers. The ship was built of the pines of Pelion under the direction of Athené, like Heré a protectress of Iason, who inserted in the prow a piece of the speaking oak of Dodona. The heroes who, at Iason's call, took part in the expedition (fifty all told, according to the number of the oars), were originally, in the version to which the Minyan family gave currency, Minyans of Iol<figure id="fig.00122">

</figure> cos, Orchomenus, Pylos, and other places. Among them were Acastus the son of Pelias, a close friend of Iason; Admetus, Erginus, Euphemus, Periclymenus, and Tiphys. But, as the story spread, all the Greek heroes that could have been living at the time were included among the number of the Argonauts—e. g. Heracles, Castor and Polydeuces, Idas and Lynceus, Calaïs and Zetes the sons of Boreas, Peleus, Tydeus, Meleager, Amphiaraüs, Orpheus, Mopsus and Idmon the prophets of the expedition, and even the huntress Atalanta. Iason takes the command, and Tiphys manages the helm. Setting sail from Pegasae, the port of Iolcos, the Argonauts make the island of Lemnos, where only women dwell, and after some considerable stay there (see <ref type="cross" target="crosshypsipyle">Hypsipylé</ref>) go past Samothrace and through the Hellespont to the island of Cyzicus, where they are hospitably received by Cyzicus, the king of the Doliones; but, attempting to proceed, are beaten back by a storm at night, and, being taken by their late friends for pirates, are attacked, and have the ill-fortune to kill their young king. On the coast of Mysia they leave Heracles behind to look for <ref type="cross" target="crosshylas">Hylas</ref> (q.v.), who has <cb /> been carried off by nymphs. On the Bithynian shore, Polydeuces vanquishes the Bebrycian king <ref type="cross" target="crossamycus">Amycus</ref> (q.v.) in a boxing-match. At Salmydessus in Thrace, the blind seer Phineus, whom Calaïs and Zetes had rid of the Harpies, his tormentors, instructs them with regard to the rest of their journey, and especially how to sail through the Symplegades, two floating rocks that clash together at the entrance to the Black Sea. By his advice Iason sends a dove before him, and as she has only her tail-feathers cut off by the colliding rocks, they venture on the feat of rowing the Argo through. By Heré's help, or, according to another account, that of Athené, they do what no man has done before: they pass through, the ship only losing her rudder. Skirting the southern shore of the Pontus, they meet with a friendly reception from Lycus , king of the Maryandini, though here the seer Idmon is killed by a wild boar in hunting, and the helmsman Tiphys dies of a disease, whereupon Ancaeus takes his place. Past the land of the Amazons they come to the island of Aretias, whence they scare away the Stymphalian birds (see <ref type="cross" target="crossheracles">Heracles</ref>), and take on board the sons of Phrixus, who had been shipwrecked there on their way to Greece. At length they reach the mouth of the Phasis in the land of the Colchians. Upon Iason's demand, Aeëtes promises to give up the golden fleece, on condition that Iason catches two brazen-hoofed, firebreathing bulls, yokes them to a brazen plough, and ploughs with them the field of Ares, sows the furrows with dragons' teeth, and overcomes the mailclad men that are to spring out of them. The hero has given up all hope of success, when Aphrodité kindles in the breast of the king's daughter Medea an irresistible love for the stranger. Medea gives him an ointment to protect him from the fiery breath of the bulls, as well as the strength to harness them, and advises him to throw a stone in among the earth-born giants, who will kill each other. But when all this is done Aeëtes does not give up the fleece. Then Iason, with the help of Medea, whom he promises to take home with him as his wife, throws the dragon that guards it into a sleep, takes it down, and escapes with Medea and his comrades. Aeëtes sends his son Absyrtus in pursuit, whom Iason kills by stratagem. Another story is that Medea takes her little brother Absyrtus with her, cuts him to pieces, and throws the limbs one by one into the sea, so that her father, while pursuing her, might be delayed in picking them up and laying them out.</p>
 <p>As to the return of the Argonauts, the legends differ considerably. One of the oldest makes them sail up the Phasis into the river Oceanus, and over that to Libya, where they drag the ship twelve days' journey overland to Lake Tritonis, and get home across the Mediterranean. Other accounts agree with this in substance, while others, again, mix up the older tradition with the adventures of Odysseus. The heroes sail up the Danube into the Adriatic, and are within hail of Corcyra (Corfu) when a storm breaks out, and the piece of oak from Dodona foretells their ruin unless they have the murder of Absyrtus expiated by Circé. Hence they 
<pb n="123" /><cb />
 sail up the Eridanus into the Rhone, and so into the Tyrrhenian Sea to the island of Circé, who purifies them. They go past the island of the Sirens, against whose magic the songs of Orpheus protect them. All but <ref type="cross" target="crossbutes">Butes</ref> (q.v.) pass in safety between Scylla and Charybdis with the help of the gods, and reach the island of the Phaeacians, where Iason marries Medea to evade the sentence of their host Alcinoüs, who, in his capacity as umpire, has given judgment that the girl Medea be delivered up to her Colchian pursuers. Already within sight of the Peloponnesus, a storm drives them into the Libyan Syrtes, whence they carry their ship, saved by divine assistance, to Lake Tritonis. Thence, guided by Triton (see <ref type="cross" target="crosseuphemus">Euphemus</ref>) into the Mediterranean, they return by way of Crete to Iolcos.</p>
 <p>During their absence Pelias has put to death Aeson and his son Promachus, and Iason's mother has taken her own life. Medea sets to work to avenge them. Before the eyes of Pelias's daughters she cuts up an old he-goat, and by boiling it in a magic caldron restores it to life and youth. Promising in like manner to renew the youth of the aged Pelias, she induces them to kill their father and then leaves them in the lurch. Driven away by Acastus, the son of the murdered king, Iason and Medea take refuge with Creon , king of Corinth. But, after ten years of happy wedlock, Iason resolves to marry Creon 's daughter Creüsa, or Glaucé. On this, Medea kills the bride and her father by sending the unsuspecting maiden a poisoned robe and a diadem as a bridal gift, murders her own two sons, Mermerus and Pheres, in her faithless husband's sight, and, escaping in a car drawn by serpents, sent by her grandfather Helios, makes her way to Aegeus, king of Athens.

 <p>The legend of the Argonauts is extremely ancient; even Homer speaks of it as universally known. We first find it treated in detail in Pindar; then the Alexandrian poet Apollonius of Rhodes (q. v.) tried to harmonize the various versions, and was followed by the Latin poets Valerius Flaccus, Varro Atacinus, and the late Greek PseudoOrpheus.

She received divine honours: at Naxos her festivals were held, now with dismal rites recalling her abandonment, and now with bacchanalian revelry befitting the happy bride of Dionysus.

In its final form it was constructed in the following manner: A stout beam, sometimes composed of several pieces, and measuring from sixty-five to one hundred feet long or more, was hung by ropes on a strongly mounted horizontal beam, and swung backwards and forwards, so as to loosen the stones of the wall and make it fall. As the engine stood close to the wall, the men 
<pb n="125" /><cb />
 working it were sheltered by a roofed shell of boards, called the ram tortoise-shell (<seg lang="la">testudo arietina</seg>) and resting on a framework that ran upon wheels. To protect the roof and sides of the shell against fire thrown from the walls, they were coated with raw or well-soaked hides, or other similar contrivances. The loosened stones were picked out of the wall with a strong iron hook at the end of a pole— the wall-sickle (<seg lang="la">falx muralis</seg>), as it was called. Single holes were punched in the wall with the wall-borer (<seg lang="la">terebra</seg>), a ram with a sharp point, which was pushed forward on rollers.</p>
 <p>The besieged tried to knock the ram's head off by dropping heavy stones on it, or to catch it in a noose and turn the blow aside or upwards, or to deaden the force of its blows with sand-bags and mats. By the usage of war, a town that wished to secure indulgent treatment must surrender before the ram touched the walls.

His strains drew a number of dolphins around him, one of which took him on its back, and carried him safe to land at the foot of the foreland of Taenarum.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρίσταρχος</foreign>). (1) A Samian mathematician and astronomer at Alexandria, who flourished between B.C. 280 and 264.</p>
 <p>(2) Of Samothrace, the celebrated grammarian, flourished B.C. 156. He was a pupil of Aristophanes, and founded at Alexandria a grammatical and critical school. At an advanced age he went to Cyprus, where he died at the age of seventy-two, of voluntary starvation, because he was suffering from incurable dropsy. Aristarchus was the greatest critic of antiquity. His labours were chiefly devoted to the Homeric poems, of which he published an edition which has been the basis of the text from his time to the present day. He divided the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> into twenty-four books each. His text of the Homeric poems is substantially the groundwork of our present recensions. It had marginal notes indicating the verses which Aristarchus regarded as spurious or doubtful, and pointing out anything worthy of remark. The meaning of the notes, and the reasons for appending them, were explained in separate commentaries and excursuses, founded on a marvellously minute acquaintance with the language and contents of the Homeric poems and the whole of Greek literature. He was the head of the school of <title>Aristarcheans</title>, who continued working on classical texts in his spirit till after the beginning of the Empire. Of his numerous grammatical and exegetical works only fragments remain. An idea of his Homeric studies, and of their character, can best be gathered from the Venetian scholia to the <title>Iliad</title>, which are largely founded on extracts from the Aristarcheans Didymus and Aristonicus.

He was still in exile in 480 at the battle of Salamis, where he did good service by dislodging the enemy, with a band raised and armed by himself, from the islet of Psyttalea. He was recalled from banishment after the battle, was appointed general in the following year (479), and commanded the Athenians at the battle of Plataea. In 477, when the allies had become disgusted with the conduct of Pausanias and the Spartans, he and his colleague Cimon had the glory of obtaining for Athens the command of the maritime confederacy <cb /> (see <ref type="cross" target="crossdelos2">Confederacy of Delos</ref>); and to Aristides was by general consent intrusted the task of drawing up its laws and fixing its assessments. The first tribute of four hundred and sixty talents, paid into a common treasury at Delos, bore his name. This is his last recorded act. He probably died in 468, and so poor that he did not leave enough to pay for his funeral. His daughters were portioned by the State, and his son Lysimachus received a grant of land and of money.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρίστιππος</foreign>). A Greek philosopher, a native of Cyrené and a pupil of Socrates, after whose death in B.C. 399 he travelled about the Greek cities, imparting instruction for money. He was founder of the Cyrenaic School, or the system of Hedonism (from <foreign lang="greek">ἡδονή</foreign>, pleasure). His doctrine was that as a basis for human knowledge the only things real and true are our sensations, and not the external objects that produce them; that the aim of life is what all living things strive after, pleasure; and that virtue is only so far a good thing as it tends to the production of pleasure. The wise man shows his wisdom in governing his desires; mental training, indeed, being the only thing which can qualify us for real enjoyment. In pleasure there is no difference of kind, only of degree and duration. Aristippus's writings seem to have disappeared early; five letters, in the Doric dialect, which have come down under his name are undoubtedly spurious.

<div2 id="crossaristophanes" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aristophănes">Aristophanes</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀριστοφάνης</foreign>). (1) The greatest writer of Greek comedy. He lived at Athens, B.C. 444-388. His father, Philippus, is said to have been not a native Athenian, but a settler from Rhodes or Egypt, who afterwards acquired citizenship. However this may be, the demagogue Cleon, whose displeasure Aristophanes had incurred, tried to call in question his right to the citizenship. His first comedy appeared in B.C. 427, but was not performed under his own name because of his youth; and several more of his plays were brought upon the stage by Callistratus and Philonides, till in 424 he brought out <title>The Knights</title> in his own person. Forty-four of his plays were known to antiquity, though four of them were considered doubtful. Of these we possess eleven, the only complete Greek comedies which have survived, besides the titles and numerous fragments of twenty-six others. The eleven are: (1) <title>The Acharnians</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαρνεῖς</foreign>), which gained him the victory over Cratinus and Eupolis, B.C. 425, written during the great Peloponnesian War to induce the Athenians to make peace.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>The Knights</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππεῖς</foreign>) mentioned above, B.C. 424, also crowned with the first prize, and aimed directly against the demagogue Cleon.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>The Clouds</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Νεφέλαι</foreign>), B.C. 423, his most famous and, in his own opinion, his most successful piece, though when played it only won the third prize. We have it now in a second, and apparently unfinished, edition. It is directed against the pernicious influence of the Sophists, as the representative of whom Socrates is attacked.</p>
 <p>(4) <title>The Wasps</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σφῆκες</foreign>), brought out in B.C. 422, and, like the two following, rewarded with the second prize; it is a satire upon the Athenian passion for lawsuits.</p>
 <p>(5) <title>The Peace</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Εἰρήνη</foreign>), of the year B.C. 421, recommending the conclusion of peace.</p>
 <p>(6) <title>The Birds</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ὄρνιθες</foreign>), acted in B.C. 414, and exposing the romantic hopes built on the expedition to Sicily. This is unquestionably the happiest production of the poet's genius, and is marked by a careful reserve in the employment of dramatic resource.</p>
 <p>(7) <title>The Lysistraté</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Λυσιστράτη</foreign>), B.C. 411, a Women's Conspiracy to bring about peace; the last of the strictly political plays.</p>
 <p>(8) <title>Thesmophoriazusae</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Θεσμοφοριάζουσαι</foreign>), probably to be dated B.C. 410. It is written against Euripides's dislike of women, for which the women who are celebrating the Thesmophoria drag him to justice.</p>
 <p>(9) <title>The Frogs</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Βάτραχοι</foreign>), which was acted in B.C. 405, and won the first prize. It is a piece sparkling with genius, on the decay of tragic art, the blame of which is laid on Euripides, then recently deceased.</p>
 <p>(10) <title>Ecclesiazusae</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐκκλησιάζουσαι</foreign>), or The National Assembly of Women, B.C. 392. It is levelled against the vain attempts to restore the Athenian state by cut-and-dried constitutions.</p>
 <p>(11) <title>Plutus</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πλοῦτος</foreign>), or The God of Wealth. The blind god is restored to sight, and better times are brought about. This play was acted first in B.C. 408, then in 388 in a revised form suitable to the time, and dispensing with chorus and parabasis. This play marks the transition to the Middle Comedy. See <ref type="cross" target="crosscomoedia">Comoedia</ref>.</p>
 <p>In the opinion of the ancients, Aristophanes holds a middle place between Cratinus and Eupolis, being neither so rough as the former nor so mild as the latter, but combining the severity of the one with the grace of the other. What was 
<pb n="128" /><cb />
 thought of him in his own time is evident from Plato's <title>Symposium</title>, where he is numbered among the noblest of men; and an epigram attributed to that philosopher says that the Graces, looking for an enduring shrine, found it in the soul of Aristophanes. He unites understanding, feeling, and fancy in a degree possessed by few poets of antiquity. His keen glance penetrates the many evils of his time and their most hidden causes; his scorn for all that is base, and his patriotic spirit, burning to bring back the grand days of Marathon, urge him on, without respect of persons or regard for self, to drag the faults he sees into daylight, and lash them with stinging sarcasm; while his inexhaustible fancy invents ever new and original materials, which he manipulates with perfect mastery of language and technical skill. If his jokes are often coarse and actually indecent, the fact must be imputed to the character of the Old Comedy and the licentiousness of the Dionysiac festival, during which the plays were acted. No literature has anything to compare with these comedies. Ancient scholars, recognizing their great importance, bestowed infinite pains in commenting on them, and valuable relics of their writings are enshrined in the existing collections of scholia.</p>
 <p>The principal MS. of Aristophanes is that of Ravenna, which contains the eleven extant plays. Next in importance is the Codex Venetus Marcianus of nearly the same date, but which lacks the <title>Acharnians, Thesmophoriazusae, Ecclesiazusae</title>, and <title>Lysistraté.</title> Both of these are probably derived from one Alexandrian archetype. The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> of Aristophanes is that of Aldus <bibl default="NO">(Venice, 1498)</bibl>, containing nine plays, to which Junta added two more <bibl default="NO">(1515)</bibl>.

 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Aristophanes the Grammarian</hi> (or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Scholar</hi>) of Byzantium, born about B.C. 260, went in his early youth to Alexandria, and was there a pupil of Zenodotus and Callimachus. On the death of Apollonius of Rhodes, Aristophanes, when past his sixtieth year, was appointed to be chief librarian, and died at the age of seventy-seven. His fame was eclipsed by that of his pupil Aristarchus, but he still passed for one of the ablest grammarians and critics of antiquity, distinguished by industry, learning, and sound judgment. In addition to the Homeric poems, which formed his favourite study, and of which he was the first to attempt a really critical text, he devoted his labours to Hesiod; the lyric poets, especially Alcaeus and Pindar; and the tragic and comic poets, Aristophanes and Menander in particular. The received introductions to the plays of the tragedians and Aristophanes are in their best parts derived from him. He was also the author of a large and much-quoted work of a lexicographical character, considerable fragments of which still survive.

<div2 id="crossaristoteles" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Aristotĕles">Aristoteles</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀριστοτέλης</foreign>). A great philosopher, the son of Nicomachus, court physician to Philip II. of Macedon, and born in B.C. 384 at Stagira, a small town in the Thracian Chalcidicé. He received from his father a training in the natural science of the day; but his philosophical education was obtained in Athens, where he was a pupil and companion of Plato during the last twenty years of the latter's life (367-347). His mind was, however, of too exact and unimaginative a type to accept the mystical idealism of Plato's later years, and we find him gradually developing a system of philosophy of his own, distinct from, and often antagonistic to, that of his teacher, whose doctrines he nevertheless always treated with pious respect, even when controverting them. In the later years of his association with Plato and the Academy he began to lecture on his own account, treating especially the subject of rhetoric. At the death of Plato the pre-eminent ability of Aristotle would seem to have designated him to succeed to the leadership of the Academy, but his divergence from his master's teaching was too great to make this possible. At the invitation of his friend Hermeas, ruler of Atarneus and Assos in Mysia, he repaired to his court, where he spent several years, and married his niece and adopted daughter Pythias. His son Nicomachus, however, was the offspring of a later union with Herpyllis, said to have been a slave, but to whom he testifies the warmest gratitude in his will. From 344 to 342 he was again in Athens, but in the latter year he accepted an invitation from King Philip to undertake the oversight of the education of his son Alexander. It is not too fanciful to trace, in the lofty views of the future conqueror, and his passionate love for the Homeric poems, the influence of his three years' association with the great philosopher. Aristotle did not forget, in this influential position, the town of his birth, but obtained from Alexander that Stagira, which had been destroyed by Philip, should be rebuilt. On Alexander's accession to the throne of Macedon in 335, Aristotle removed to Athens, and established his school in the gymnasium known as the Lyceum, from whose shady walks (<foreign lang="greek">περίπατοι</foreign>) his pupils became known as Peripatetics. He is said to have given two classes of lectures: the more abstruse discussions (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκροαματικά</foreign>) in the morning for an inner circle of advanced pupils, and the popular discourses (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξωτερικά</foreign>) in the evening for the general body of lovers of knowledge. At the death of Alexander, in 323, the anti-Macedonian party in Athens recovered a temporary ascendency, and Aristotle was involved in an accusation for impiety, to escape which he fled to Chalcis in Euboea, in order, as he said, “that the Athenians might not for a second time commit a sin against philosophy.” Here he died soon after, in 322, of a stomach complaint. A grave recently <bibl default="NO">(1891)</bibl> excavated at Chalcis, by the explorers of the American School at Athens, is identified with considerable probability as that of Aristotle. His will, perhaps genuine, is preserved to us in Diogenes Laertius, v. 1. A statuette in the Mattei Palace and a life-size statue in the Villa Spada at Rome reproduce the keen features of the profound thinker. His character, if we may judge from the tone of his writings and from the provisions of his will, was mild and generous; and the slanderous reports found in such writers as Athenaeus may be dismissed as utterly without foundation. 
<pb n="129" /><cb />
 The many-sided activity of Aristotle's mind and his prodigious industry are shown in the extent and variety of his writings, which embraced, according to Diogenes Laertius, 146 works in 400 books. Another list, which seems to rest on the authority of the Peripatetic Andronicus, who in the time of Cicero published a new edition of Aristotle's works, gives the number of books as 1000. <figure id="fig.00129">
<head orig="Head of Aristotle.">Head of Aristotle.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p>The history of his writings, if a widely accepted tradition be true, is a romantic one. After the death of Theophrastus, who had succeeded to the leadership of the Peripatetic School, his library, including the works of Aristotle, is said to have passed into the hands of his pupil Neleus of Scepsis in the Troad. The heirs of Neleus, to protect the books from the literary greed of the Attalids of Pergamus, concealed them in a vault, where they were injured by dampness and the ravages of moths and worms. In this hiding-place they were discovered about the year B.C. 100 by <ref type="cross" target="crossapellicon">Apellicon</ref> (q.v.), a rich book-lover, and conveyed to Athens, whence they were taken to Rome after the capture of Athens by Sulla in B.C. 86. In Rome they soon attracted the attention of scholars, and the new edition then prepared by Andronicus (see above) gave a fresh impetus to the study of Aristotle and of philosophy in general. Strangely enough, the list of works in Diogenes Laertius, mentioned above, does not seem to contain any of the forty treatises in our Aristotle, and it is not impossible that the whole catalogue is a list of forgeries, compiled at a time when the real works were lost to sight. The greater part of what has come down to us under the name of Aristotle is undoubtedly genuine.</p>
 <p>The works of Aristotle fall naturally under three heads: I. Dialogues and other works of a popular character. II. Collections of facts and material for scientific treatment. III. Systematic works. Among his writings of a popular character the only one which we possess of any consequence is the interesting tract <title>On the Polity of the Athenians</title>, recently discovered in some Egyptian papyri, and edited by Kenyon under the auspices of the British Museum <bibl default="NO">(London, 1891)</bibl>. It is written in a clear and easy style, and sheds a flood of new light on Athenian political history, and especially on the Constitution in Aristotle's own time. Of the works of the second class nothing worthy of mention has been preserved. The systematic treatises are <cb /> marked by a severe plainness of style, with none of the golden flow of language which the ancients praised in Aristotle. This may be due to the fact that these works were not, in most cases, published by Aristotle himself or during his lifetime, but were edited after his death, from unfinished MSS., by Eudemus, Nicomachus, or Theophrastus.</p>
 <p>Aristotle's systematic treatises may be grouped in several divisions, in accordance with the subjects discussed, as follows: I. Logic. II. Natural Science. III. Psychology and Metaphysics. IV. Ethics. V. Politics. VI. Rhetoric.</p>
 <p>I. The writings on the general subject of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Logic</hi> were included by the later Peripatetics under the name of <title>Organon</title>, or Instrument, as having to do with reasoning, the chief instrument of dialectic and scientific investigation. They embrace (1) the <title>Categories</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Κατηγορίαι</foreign>), treating of the ten fundamental forms of predicating existence (probably not by Aristotle himself, but by one of his pupils).</p>
 <p>(2) <title>On Interpretation</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας</foreign>), dealing with the forms and parts of the sentence.</p>
 <p>(3) <title>Prior</title> and <title>Posterior Analytics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀναλυτικὰ Πρότερα</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">Ὕστερα</foreign>), containing (<seg lang="la">a</seg>) the doctrine of scientific proof and (<seg lang="la">b</seg>) of cognition or knowledge in general.</p>
 <p>(4) The <title>Topics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Τοπικά</foreign>), on the art of dialectic.</p>
 <p>(5) The <title>Sophistical Refutations</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Σοφιστικοὶ Ἔλεγχοι</foreign>), an examination of the fallacies of the Sophists, then in such vogue. All of the most important of Aristotle's works in the domain of Logic have come down to us, and they include the most enduring contribution which the great aualyst has made to human thought. The science of deductive reasoning has made no essential progress since his day. II. The works in the department of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Natural Science</hi> are (1) the <title>Physics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Φυσικὴ Ἀκρόασις</foreign>). This is not a treatise on physics in the modern sense of the term, but is happily styled by Hegel the “metaphysics of physics.” It treats of the principles of existence, of matter and form, explaining the fundamental conceptions in accordance with which we look at the phenomena of nature.</p>
 <p>(2) <title>On the Heavens</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Οὐρανοῦ</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(3) <title>On Generation and Decay</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Γενέσεως καὶ Φθορᾶς</foreign>), discussing the pairs of opposites, hot and cold, and wet and dry, and how their different combinations produce the four elements of fire, air, earth, and water.</p>
 <p>(4) <title>Meteorology</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Μετεωρολογικά</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(5) <title>Researches about Animals</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Αἱ περὶ τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(6) <title>On the Parts of Animals</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ζῴων Μορίων</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(7) <title>On the Generation of Animals</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ζῴων Γενέσεως</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(8) <title>On Locomotion of Animals</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Πορείας Ζῴων</foreign>).</p>
 <p>(9) A number of shorter works are usually classed together under the head of <title>Parva Naturalia.</title> They treat of sense and sensation, youth and age, and other phenomena of life. The treatises <title>On Plants, On the Universe, On Motion, On Respiration, On Colour, On Physiognomy, On Strange Statements</title>, and the collection of various scientific <title>Problems</title>, are all of doubtful authenticity. The above-mentioned works exhibit an astonishing breadth of observation in natural history. The <title>Researches about Animals</title> shows an acquaintance with almost five hundred different species, and the observations on the purpose and adaptation of the organs of various creatures are characterized by remarkable insight. III. <hi rend="SmallCaps">Psychology and Metaphysics</hi>. (1) <title>On the Soul</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ τῆς Ψυχῆς</foreign>). This treatise might fairly be classed with the works on natural science, as it does not deal with psychology in the modern sense, but with the physiology of the vital principle in animals generally.
 
<pb n="130" /><cb /></p>
 <p>(2) The <title>Metaphysics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Μεταφυσικά</foreign>), as the name indicates, forms the highest step in Aristotle's system, and deals with the first principles of all existence. Here he grapples with the deepest questions of philosophy, but with less clear and satisfactory results than he reaches in many of his discussions. His doctrine of mind (<foreign lang="greek">νοῦς</foreign>), or the godhead, as the power that moves the starry heavens, is not sufficient to account for the structure of the universe or the origin of existing things. <hi rend="SmallCaps">IV. Ethics</hi>. The ethical works of Aristotle embrace (1) the <title>Nicomachean Ethics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἠθικὰ Νικομάχεια</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(2) the <title>Eudemean Ethics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἠθικὰ Εὐδήμεια</foreign>);</p>
 <p>(3) the so-called <title>Magna Moralia</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἠθικὰ Μεγάλα</foreign>). The foundation principles of the Aristotelian system of morals appear alike in all of these works, but it is probable that the first alone is the work of the philosopher himself. He teaches that happiness is the highest good, and that this is found in an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. Virtue is a permanent state of the soul, and consists in the mean between the too much (<foreign lang="greek">ὑπερβολή</foreign>) and the too little (<foreign lang="greek">ἔλλειψις</foreign>). The <title>Nicomachean Ethics</title> is one of the most interesting of Aristotle's works, and his descriptions of some of the virtuous characters (see bk. iv.) are exceedingly impressive. <hi rend="SmallCaps">V. Politics</hi>. Closely connected with the <title>Ethics</title> is the <title>Politics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Πολιτικά</foreign>). The best ordering of the State was, to Aristotle's mind, the worthiest problem for the philosopher; and though his treatment of the subject was not brought to a logical conclusion, yet the work contains much valuable information and abounds in interesting remarks. The <title>Economics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Οἰκονομικά</foreign>) is probably the work of some later writer of the Peripatetic School. <hi rend="SmallCaps">VI. Rhetoric</hi>. The rhetorical works include (1) the <title>Poetics</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Περὶ Ποιητικῆς</foreign>), and</p>
 <p>(2) the <title>Art of Rhetoric</title> (<foreign lang="greek">Τέχνη Ῥητορική</foreign>). The first of these, though insignificant in length, has received more consideration in recent years than almost any other work of the author. The famous definition of tragedy in chap. vi., the discussion of the parts of tragedy in chap. xii., and the distinction between epic and tragic poetry in chap. xxvi. are passages of the greatest interest and value. The celebrated doctrine of the <foreign lang="greek">κάθαρσις</foreign> effected by tragedy (vi. 2) has given rise to much discussion, but has not yet been satisfactorily explained. The doctrine of the three “unities” of tragedy, upon which so much stress has been laid by the French critics, was first promulgated by Aristotle in this work. The <title>Rhetoric</title> treats of oratorical proof, and its leading elements, together with an interesting discussion (bk. iii.) of style—all marked by the author's usual clear and exhaustive treatment.</p>
 <p>In reviewing the works of Aristotle we are at a loss whether to admire most his vast and accurate observation of nature, his profound acquaintance with the literature of his day, or his deep and penetrating insight, his keen analysis, and his unfailing good sense. In his love for research and his critical tendency he may be regarded as the forerunner of the Alexandrian Age which was soon to open. His style, though so concise as sometimes to be obscure, is often a model of condensed energy, and his occasional illustrations are marvellously appropriate. His influence on the course of human thought since his day has been almost boundless. In antiquity he was the most honoured philosopher, while the early Christian writers compared Plato and Aristotle to Moses and Christ. He was the oracle <cb /> of the Middle Ages, when his writings, through his followers, the schoolmen, were almost all that saved Europe from utter barbarism. The Arabians, in the reign of the calif Al Mamun (A.D. 813), began to translate his works, which became the foundation of Saracenic culture, and were brought by them to the knowledge of Western Europe through the medium of Latin versions from the Arabic. In Arabic tradition Aristotle is the “wisest man,” just as his pupil Ishkander (Alexander) is the hero of warlike fable. The Roman Catholic Church almost canonized him, and his philosophical system, as modified by the great Dominicans Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, lies at the basis of Catholic theology to-day. But when the Renaissance gave back to Europe the knowledge of Plato, the popularity of Aristotle declined. Plato's perfection of form, and the fact that he wrote for the enlightened public generally, rather than for an inner circle of special students, no doubt contributed to this result. The Reformers, who regarded Aristotle as the bulwark of the Papacy, attacked him bitterly, and by the middle of the eighteenth century he had been almost set aside. It was reserved for the nineteenth century, through the labours of Schleiermacher, Spengel, Brandis, and others, to find the key to the true historical appreciation of the value of Aristotle.</p>
 <p>The influence of Aristotle on the vocabulary of modern philosophy is worthy of especial notice. A large number of terms which are in constant use to-day are derived from him, either directly or through the medium of Latin equivalents. Some of these are: <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρχή</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ὑποκείμενον</foreign>), <seg lang="la">matter</seg> (<seg lang="la">materies</seg>=<foreign lang="greek">ὕλη</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">form, end, final cause, faculty</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">δύναμις</foreign>), <seg lang="la">energy, category, predicament, habit, mean, extreme, quintessence, metaphysics</seg>, etc.</p>

<head orig="Arma, Armatūra">Arma, Armatura</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ὅπλα, ἔντεα, τεύχεα</foreign>). Arms, armour. The weapons of attack and defence employed by the Greeks of historic times are essentially the same as those with which the Homeric heroes appear equipped in an earlier age. The changes gradually introduced, especially after the Persian Wars, tended to make the armour lighter and to give greater power of movement to the combatants. For defensive armour they used a helmet (<foreign lang="greek">κόρυς, κυνέη</foreign>); a cuirass (<foreign lang="greek">θώραξ</foreign>) (see <ref type="cross" target="crossthorax">Thorax</ref>); a girdle (<foreign lang="greek">ζώνη</foreign>) of leather or felt, covering the lower part of the body, and reaching down to the middle of the thighs. Sometimes this consisted of narrow strips called <foreign lang="greek">πτέρυγες</foreign> (wings) arranged either in single or double rows, and covered with metal. Sometimes it was a complete coat plated with bands of metal. The greaves (<foreign lang="greek">κνημῖδες</foreign>) covered the front part of the legs from the ankles to just above the knee, and consisted of flexible metal plates or leather fastened behind with buckles. The weapons of defence were completed by the shield.</p>
 <p>For offensive weapons they had, besides the sword (<foreign lang="greek">ξίφος</foreign>), the lance (<foreign lang="greek">δόρυ</foreign>), five to seven feet long. This was of iron, sometimes broader, sometimes narrower, and sometimes hooked and with an iron joint on the butt end which served to fix the spear more easily in the ground, or could be used as an offensive weapon when the regular head was broken off. The cavalry used a shorter lance (<foreign lang="greek">πάλτον</foreign>) for hurling as well as thrusting; this was much shorter than the Macedonian <foreign lang="greek">σάρισσα</foreign>. The other weapons of attack were javelins (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκόντια</foreign>) of different sizes, the longer kinds of which were hurled by means of a thong, bows and arrows (see <ref type="cross" target="crossarcus">Arcus</ref>), and slings. On the equipment of the different kinds of troops, see <ref type="cross" target="crossgymnetae">Gymnetae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshippeis">Hippeis</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshoplitae">Hoplitae</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspeltastae">Peltastae</ref>.</p>
 <p>Among the Romans the full equipment of defensive armour similarly consisted of helmet (<seg lang="la">cassis, galea</seg>), cuirass (see <ref type="cross" target="crosslorica">Lorica</ref>), greaves (<seg lang="la">ocrea</seg>), and shield (<seg lang="la">clipeus, scutum</seg>). With regard to the greaves, it must be noted that in later times the infantry wore them only on the right leg, which was unprotected by the shield.</p>
 <p>Besides the sword (<seg lang="la">ensis, gladius</seg>), the horse and foot of the legion alike used, as an offensive weapon, the lance (see <ref type="cross" target="crosshasta">Hasta</ref>). It was only the light-armed troops that fought with javelins and slings. Then the <seg lang="la">pilum</seg> (q. v.) was introduced, first for a part and finally for the whole of the legion. This was the missile which the Romans hurled at the commencement of a battle before <cb /> coming to close quarters with their swords. Bows were not a national weapon with the Romans, and were only used by their allies. See <ref type="cross" target="crossexercitus">Exercitus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosslegio">Legio</ref>.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρμενία</foreign>). A country of Asia, lying between Asia Minor and the Caspian Sea, in a lofty table-land, backed by the chain of the Caucasus, watered by the rivers Cyrus and Araxes, and containing the sources of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, the latter of which divides the country into two unequal parts, which were called Maior and Minor. The people of Armenia were one of the most ancient families of that branch of the human race which is called Caucasian. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossindo-european-languages">Indo-European Languages</ref>.) They were conquered by the Assyrians and Persians, and were at a later time subject to the Greek kings of Syria. When Antiochus the Great (q. v.) was defeated by the Romans (B.C. 190), the country regained its independence, and was at this period divided into the two kingdoms of Armenia Maior and Minor. Ultimately, Armenia Minor was made a Roman province by Trajan; and Armenia Maior, after being a perpetual object of contention between the Romans and the Parthians, was subjected to the revived Persian Empire by its first king, Artaxerxes, in A.D. 226.

 <p> The Latinized form of <title>Hermann</title>, “the chieftain.” Son of Sigimer, and chief of the tribe of the Cherusci, who inhabited the country to the north of the Hartz Mountains, now forming the south of Hanover and Brunswick. He was born in B.C. 18; and in his youth he led the Cherusci as auxiliaries of the Roman legions in Germany, where he learned the Roman language, was admitted to the freedom of the city, and enrolled among the equites. In A.D. 9, Arminius persuaded his countrymen to rise against the Romans, who were now masters of this part of Germany. His attempt was crowned with success. Quintilius Varus, who was stationed in the country with three legions, was destroyed, with almost all his troops (see <ref type="cross" target="crossvarus">Varus</ref>); and the Romans had to relinquish all their possessions beyond the Rhine. In A.D. 14, Arminius had to defend his country against Germanicus. At first he was successful, but Germanicus made good his retreat to the Rhine. It was in the course of this campaign that Thusnelda, the wife of Arminius, fell into the hands of the Romans. In A.D. 16, Arminius was defeated by Germanicus, and his country was probably only saved from subjection by the jealousy of Tiberius, who recalled Germanicus in the <cb /> following year. At length Arminius aimed at absolute power, and was in consequence cut off by his own relations in the thirty-seventh year of his age, A.D. 19. A colossal statue of Arminius by Bandel was erected in August, 1875, near Detmold in Germany.

 <p> An earnest. The word <seg lang="la">arrabo</seg> is Semitic, and occurs (<foreign lang="greek">ἀρραβών</foreign>, <title>LXX.</title>) in Gen. xxxviii. 17-20, of a ring, bracelets, and staff given as a pledge for the price, and the corresponding verb in Hebrew several times. The Phoenician traders probably brought word and custom to Greece, and Plautus probably followed in this a Greek original.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">τὰ ἀρρηφόρια</foreign>). A festival which, according to the various ways in which the name is written (for we find <foreign lang="greek">ἐρσηφόρια</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐρρηφόρια</foreign>), is attributed to different deities. The first form is derived from <foreign lang="greek">ἄρρητα</foreign>, and thus would indicate a festival at which mysterious things were carried about. The other name would point to Ersé or Hersé, who was believed to be a daughter of Cecrops, and whose worship was intimately connected with that of Athené. But, even admitting the latter, we still have sufficient ground for believing that the festival was solemnized, in a higher sense, in honour of Athené. It was held at Athens, in the month of Scitophorion. See Mommsen, <title>Heortologie</title>, pp. 443 foll.

<head orig="Arriānus">Arrianus</head>

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossflavius">Flavius</ref>. A Greek author, who wrote chiefly on philosophy and history. He was born at Nicomedia in Bithynia, towards the end of the first century A.D., and was a pupil of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus. He lived under the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius, enjoying a high reputation for culture and ability, which procured him the citizenship of Rome and Athens, and high offices of state, such as the governorship of Cappadocia under Hadrian, A.D. 136, and the consulship under Antoninus. His last years were spent in his native town, where he filled the office of priest to Demeter, and died at an advanced age. From the likeness of his character to that of the <cb /> famous Athenian, he was nicknamed “Xenophon Junior.” Of his philosophical works we have still the first half (four books) of the <title>Discourses of Epictetus</title>, a leading authority for the tenets of that philosopher and the Stoical ethics; and the handbook called the <title>Encheiridion of Epictetus</title>, a short manual of morality, which on account of its pithy and practical precepts became a great favourite with Pagans and Christians, had a commentary written on it by Simplicius in the sixth century, and after the revival of learning was long used as a school-book. Of his numerous historical writings we possess the chief one, the <title>Anabasis of Alexander</title>, in seven books. This is a complete history of that conqueror from his accession to his death, drawn from the best sources, especially Ptolemy and Aristobulus, and modelled on Xenophon, of whom we are reminded by the very title and the number of books, though it has none of Xenophon's charm. It is the best work on Alexander that has survived from antiquity. To this we should add the <title>Indica</title>, a short work on India, written in the Ionic dialect, and especially valuable for its abstract of Nearchus's report of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus to the Persian Gulf; also the description of another coasting voyage, the <title>Periplus Ponti Euxini</title>, and a trifling treatise on hunting, the <title>Cynegeticus.</title> A work on tactics wrongly ascribed to him is probably from the hand of Aelian the Tactician. Of his other histories—e. g. of the successors of Alexander, of Trajan's battles with the Parthians, of his own native country till its absorption into the Empire, and the campaign against the Alani during his command in Cappadocia—we have only abstracts or fragments. The best edition of the <title>Anabasis</title> is that of Krüger <bibl default="NO">(1848)</bibl>. There is an English translation by Chinnock <bibl default="NO">(1893)</bibl>.

 <p>(12) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phraātes III.</hi>, son of the preceding, lived at the time of the war between the Romans and Mithridates of Pontus, by both of whom he was courted. He was murdered by his two sons, Mithridates and Orodes.</p>
 <p>(13) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Mithridātes III.</hi>, son of the preceding, was expelled from the throne on account of his cruelty, and was succeeded by his brother Orodes.</p>
 <p>(14) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Orōdes I.</hi>, brother of the preceding, was the Parthian king whose general Surenas defeated Crassus and the Romans, B.C. 53. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosscrassus">Crassus</ref>.) After the death of Crassus, Orodes gave the command of the army to his son Pacorus, who invaded Syria both in 51 and 50, but was in each year driven back by Cassius. In 40, the Parthians again invaded Syria, under the command of Pacorus and Labienus, but were defeated in 39 by Ventidius Bassus, one of Antony's legates. In 38, Pacorus once more invaded Syria, but was completely defeated and fell in the battle. This defeat was a severe blow to the aged king, Orodes, who shortly afterwards surrendered the crown to his son Phraates during his lifetime.</p>
 <p>(15) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phraātes IV</hi>. was a cruel tyrant. In 36, Antony invaded Parthia, but was obliged to retreat after losing a great part of his army. A few years afterwards Phraates was driven out of the country by his subjects, and Tiridates proclaimed king in his stead. Phraates, however, was soon restored by the Scythians, and Tiridates fled to Augustus, carrying with him the youngest son of Phraates. Augustus restored his son to Phraates, on condition of his surrendering the Roman standards and prisoners taken in the war with Crassus and Antony. They were given up in 20, and their restoration was celebrated not only by the poets, but by festivals and commemorative monuments. Phraates also sent to Augustus as hostages his four sons. In A.D. 2, Phraates was poisoned by his wife Thermusa and her son Phraataces.</p>
 <p>(16) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Phraatăces</hi> reigned only a short time, as he was expelled by his subjects on account of his crimes. The Parthian nobles then elected as king Orodes, who was of the family of the Arsacidae.</p>
 <p>(17) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Orōdes II</hi>. also reigned only a short time, as he was killed by the Parthians on account of his cruelty. Upon his death the Parthians applied to the Romans for Vonones, one of the sons of Phraates IV., who was accordingly granted to them.</p>
 <p>(18) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Vonōnes I.</hi>, son of Phraates IV., was also disliked by his subjects, who therefore invited Artabanus, king of Media, to take possession of the kingdom. Artabanus drove Vonones out of Parthia, who resided first in Armenia, next in Syria, and subsequently in Cilicia. He was put to death in A.D. 19.</p>
 <p>(19) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Artabānus III</hi>. obtained the Parthian kingdom soon after the expulsion of Vonones, <cb /> about A.D. 16. Artabanus was involved in hostilities with the Romans, and was expelled more than once by his subjects.

He carried on war with the Romans, but was defeated by Domitius Corbulo, and at length made peace with the Romans on condition that Tiridates should receive Armenia as a gift from the Roman emperor. Accordingly Tiridates came to Rome in 63, and obtained from Nero the Armenian crown. (24) <ref type="cross" target="crosspacorus">Pacŏrus</ref> succeeded his father, Vologeses I., and was a contemporary of Domitian and Trajan. (25) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Chosroës</hi> or <hi rend="SmallCaps">Osroës</hi> succeeded his brother Pacorus during the reign of Trajan. His conquest of Armenia occasioned the invasion of Parthia by Trajan, who stripped it of many of its provinces, and made the Parthians for a time subject to Rome. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstraianus">Traianus</ref>.) Upon the death of Trajan, in A.D. 117, Hadrian relinquished the conquests of Trajan, and made the Euphrates, as before, the eastern boundary of the Roman Empire. (26) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Vologēses II</hi>. succeeded his father, Chosroës, and reigned from about A.D. 122 to 149. (27) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Vologēses III</hi>. was defeated by the generals of the emperor Verus, and purchased peace by ceding Mesopotamia to the Romans. From this time to the downfall of the Parthian Empire there is great confusion in the list of kings.

Thus ended the Parthian Empire of the Arsacidae, after it had existed 476 years.

<head orig="Arsinŏë">Arsinoe</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρσινόη</foreign>). (1) The daughter of Meleager, and mother of Ptolemy I. of Egypt, by Philip, father of Alexander. During her pregnancy she was married to Lagus.</p>
 <p>(2) The daughter of Ptolemy I. of Egypt and Berenicé. She married Lysimachus, king of Thrace, who was already advanced in years, by whom she had several children. Lysimachus, setting out for Asia, left her in Macedouia, with two sons, Lysimachus and Philip, a part of the fruits of their union. This monarch having been slain in an expedition, Ptolemy Ceraunus seized on Macedonia, but could not take the city of Cassandria, where Arsinoé had taken refuge with her children. He therefore offered her his hand in marriage, and with much difficulty obtained her consent. But no sooner had he been admitted into the city for the purpose of celebrating the nuptials, than he caused her two sons to be slain, and exiled Arsinoé herself to Samothrace. From this island she soon took her departure to wed Ptolemy Philadelphus, her own brother, the first instance of this kind of union, and which became afterwards so common in the time of the Ptolemies. Although many years older than Ptolemy, she nevertheless inspired him with such a passion that, after her death, he gave her name to one of the nomes of Egypt (Arsinoïtis), and to several cities both in that country and elsewhere. He even gave orders to have a temple erected to her, but his own death and that of the architect prevented the fulfilment of his wishes. It was intended to have had the ceiling of loadstone, and the statue of iron, in order that the latter might appear to be suspended in the air ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34. 14" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xxxiv. 14</bibl>).</p>
 <p>(3) A daughter of Lysimachus, king of Thrace, and the earlier wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus. She became by him the mother of Ptolemy III. (Euergetes), Lysimachus, and Berenicé. After Ptolemy's union with Arsinoé, his own sister, she was banished to Coptos. The charge brought against her was a design to overthrow her rival.</p>
 <p>(4) Daughter of Ptolemy III. and Berenicé, married Ptolemy Philopator, her brother. Her husband subsequently having become enamoured of Agathoclea, and being completely ruled by this woman and her brothers, was induced, at their instigation, to order Arsinoé to be put to death.</p>
 <p>(5) A daughter of Ptolemy Auletes, proclaimed queen by Ganymedes, when Caesar attacked Alexandria. She was conquered, and brought in triumph to Rome; but, as this proved displeasing to the people, she was set at liberty. Subsequently, at the instigation of her younger sister Cleopatra , she was put to death by the orders of Antony, in the Temple of Artemis at Miletus.

She is armed, as he is, with bow and arrows, which, like him, and often together with him, she wields against monsters and giants; hence the paean was chanted to her as well as to him. Like those of Apollo, the shafts of Artemis were regarded as the cause of sudden death, especially to maidens and wives. But she was also a <cb /> beneficent and helpful deity. As Apollo is the luminous god of day, she with her torch is a goddess of light by night, and in course of time becomes identified with all possible goddesses of moon and night. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossselene">Selené</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosshecate">Hecaté</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbendis">Bendis</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossbritomartis">Britomartis</ref>.) Her proper domain is that of nature, with its hills and valleys, woods, meadows, rivers, and fountains; there, amid her nymphs, herself the fairest and tallest, she is a mighty huntress, sometimes chasing wild animals, sometimes dancing, playing, or bathing with her companions. Her favourite haunt was thought to be the mountains and forests of Arcadia, where, in many spots, she had sanctuaries, consecrated hunting-grounds, and sacred animals. To her, as goddess of the forest and the chase, all beasts of the woods and fields—in fact, all game—were dear and sacred; but her favourite animal was held all over Greece <figure id="fig.00136">
<head orig="Diana of Versailles. (Louvre.)">Diana of Versailles. (Louvre.)</head>
</figure> to be the hind. From this sacred animal and the hunting of it, the month which the other Greeks called Artemision or Artemisios (March-April) was named by the Athenians Elaphebolion (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐλαφηβολιών</foreign>), and her festival as goddess of game and hunting, at which deer or cakes in the shape of deer were offered up, Elaphebolia. As goddess of the chase, she had also some influence in war, and the Spartans before battle sought her favour by the gift of a she-goat. Miltiades, too, before the battle of Marathon, had vowed to her as many goats as there should be enemies fallen on the field; but the number proving so great that the vow could not be kept, five hundred goats were sacrificed at each anniversary of the victory in the month of Boedromion. Again, she was much worshipped as the goddess of the moon. At Amarynthus in Euboea the whole island kept holiday to her with processions and prize-fights. At Munychia in Attica, at full moon in the month of Munychion (April-May), large round loaves or cakes, decked all around with lights as a symbol of her own luminary, were borne in procession and presented to her; and at the same time was solemnized the festival of the victory of Salamis in 
<pb n="137" /><cb />
 Cyprus, because on that occasion the goddess had shone in her full glory on the Greeks. An ancient shrine of the Moon-goddess at Brauron in Attica was held in such veneration that the Brauronia, originally a merely local festival, was afterwards made a public ceremony, to which Athens itself sent deputies every five years, and a precinct was dedicated to “Artemis of Brauron” on the Acropolis itself. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacropolis">Acropolis</ref>.) At this feast the girls between five and ten years of age, clad in saffron-coloured garments, were conducted by their mothers in procession to the goddess and commended to her care; for Artemis is also a protectress of youth, especially those of her own sex. As such she patronized a nurses' festival at Sparta in a temple outside the town, to which little boys were brought by their nurses; while the Ionians at their <ref type="cross" target="crossapaturia">Apaturia</ref> (q.v.) presented her with the hair of boys. Almost everywhere young girls revered the virgin goddess as the guardian of their maiden years, and before marriage they offered up to her a lock of their hair, their girdle, and their maiden garment. She was also worshipped in many parts as the goddess of good repute, especially in youths and maidens, and was regarded as an enemy of all disorderly doings. With her attributes as the goddess of the moon, and as the promoter of healthy development, especially in the female frame, is connected the notion of her assisting in childbirth. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossilithyia">Ilithyia</ref>.) In early times human sacrifices had been offered to Artemis. A relic of this was the yearly custom observed at Sparta of flogging the boys till they bled at the altar of a deity not unknown elsewhere and named Artemis Orthia (the upright), probably from her stiff posture in the antiquated wooden image. At Sparta, as in other places, the ancient image was looked upon as the same which Iphigenia and Orestes brought away from Tauris (the Crimea)—viz., that of the Tanric Artemis, a Scythian deity who was identified with Artemis because of the human sacrifices common in her worship. The Artemis of Ephesus, too, so greatly honoured by all the Ionians of Asia (Acts, xix. 28), is no Greek divinity, but Asiatic. <figure id="fig.00137">
<head orig="Ancient Representation of the Ephesian Artemis.">Ancient Representation of the Ephesian Artemis.</head>
</figure> This is sufficiently shown by the fact that eunuchs were employed in her worship— a practice quite foreign to Greek ideas. The Greek colonists identified her with their own Artemis, because she was goddess of the moon and a power of nature, present in mountains, woods, and marshy places, nourishing life in plants, animals, and men. But, unlike Artemis, she was not regarded as a virgin, but as a mother and foster-mother, as is clearly shown by the multitude of breasts in the effigy. Her worship, frantic and fanatical after the manner of Asia, was traced back to the Amazons. A number of other deities native to Asia were also worshipped by the Greeks under the name of Artemis.</p>
 <p>Artemis appears in works of art as the ideal of austere <cb /> maiden beauty—tall of stature, with bow and quiver on her shoulder, or torch in her hand, and generally leading or carrying a hind, or riding in a chariot drawn by hinds. Her commonest character is that of a huntress. In earlier times the figure is fuller and stronger and the clothing more complete; in later works she is represented as more slender and lighter of foot, the hair loose, the dress girt high, the feet protected by the Cretan shoe. The most celebrated of her existing statues is the Diana of Versailles, from Hadrian's villa at Tibur. On the identification of Artemis with the Italian Diana, see <ref type="cross" target="crossdiana">Diana</ref>.

<div2 id="crossartemisia" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Artemisia">Artemisia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀρτεμισία</foreign>). (1) The daughter of Lygdamis of Halicarnassus, reigned over Halicarnassus, and also over Cos and other adjacent islands. She joined the fleet of Xerxes, when he invaded Greece, with five vessels, the best equipped of the whole fleet after those of the Sidonians; and she displayed so much valour and skill at the battle of Salamis as to elicit from Xerxes the wellknown remark that the men had acted like women in the fight and the women like men. The Athenians, indignant that a woman should appear in arms against them, offered a reward of 10,000 drachmae to any one who should take her prisoner. She, however, escaped after the action ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 99" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 99</bibl>; viii. 88<bibl n="Hdt.  93" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod., 93</bibl>). If we are to believe Ptolemy Hephaestion, a writer who mixed up many fables with some truth, Artemisia subsequently conceived an attachment for a youth of Abydos, named Dardanus; but, not meeting with a return for her passion, she put out his eyes while he slept, and then threw herself down from the Lover's Leap at the promontory of Leucaté.</p>
 <p>(2) Another queen of Caria, not to be confounded with the preceding. She was the daughter of Hecatomnus, king of Caria, and married her brother Mausolus, a species of union sanctioned by the customs of the country. She lost her husband, who was remarkable for personal beauty, B.C. 365, and she became, in consequence, a prey to the deepest affliction. A splendid tomb was erected to his memory, called Mausoleum (<foreign lang="greek">Μαυσωλεῖον</foreign>, scil. <foreign lang="greek">μνημεῖιον</foreign>, i. e. “tomb of Mausolus”), and the most noted writers of the day were invited to attend a literary contest, in which ample rewards were to be bestowed on those who should celebrate with most ability the praises of the deceased. Among the individuals who came together on that occasion were, according to Aulus Gellius (x. 18), Theopompus, Theodectes, Naucrites, and even Isocrates. The prize was won by Theopompus. Valerius Maximus and Aulus Gellius relate a marvellous story concerning the excessive grief of Artemisia. They say that she actually mixed the ashes of her husband with water and drank them off ( <bibl n="Max.  4. 6" default="NO">Max.iv. 6</bibl>). The grief of Artemisia, poignant though it was, did not cause her to neglect the care of her dominions: she conquered the island of Rhodes, and gained possession of some Greek cities on the mainland; and yet it is said that she died of grief two years after the loss of her husband.

 <p> or <hi rend="bold">Amianthus</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἄσβεστος, ἀμιάντος</foreign>). A mineral obtained by the ancients from India, Cyprus, and Euboea. It was well adapted for making the wicks of lamps, because indestructible by fire; and hence the Greeks, who used it for this purpose, gave it the name <foreign lang="greek">ἄσβεστος</foreign>, which means inextinguishable. Pausanias mentions that the golden lamp which burned day and night in the temple of Athené Polias at Athens had a wick of this substance.</p>
 <p>It was also spun and woven into cloth. Thus manufactured, it was used for napkins (<foreign lang="greek">χειρεκμαγεῖα, χειρόμακτρα</foreign>), which were never washed, but cleansed in a much more effective manner, whenever they required it, by being thrown into the fire.</p>
 <p>Another use to which asbestine cloth was applied was to preserve the remains of dead bodies burned in the funeral pile. But the expense of this kind of cloth was so great that it could only be used at the obsequies of persons of the most exalted rank. The testimony of Pliny has been corroborated by the discovery of pieces of the cloth in ancient Roman or Italian sepulchres. The most remarkable specimen of this kind was found at Rome, A.D. 1702, in a marble sarcophagus, enveloping a skull and bones, and in size about five feet by six and a half. It is now in the Vatican.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀσεβείας γραφή</foreign>). One of the many forms prescribed by the Attic laws for the impeachment of impiety. This crime was apparently as ill-defined at Athens, and therefore as liable to be made the pretext for persecution, as it has been in all other countries in which the civil power has attempted to reach offences so much beyond the natural limits of its jurisdiction. The occasions, however, upon which the Athenian accuser professed to come forward may be classed as, first, breaches of the ceremonial law of public worship; and, secondly, indications of that which in analogous cases of modern times would be called heterodoxy or heresy. The former comprehended encroachment upon consecrated grounds, the plunder or other injury of temples, the violation of asylums, the interruption of sacrifices and 
<pb n="140" /><cb />
 festivals, the mutilation of statues of the gods, the introduction of deities not acknowledged by the state, etc.</p>
 <p>The heretical delinquencies may be exemplified by the expulsion of Protagoras for writing that “he could not learn whether the gods existed or not”; in the persecution of Anaxagoras—like that of Galileo, in after-times, for impugning the received opinions about the sun—and the condemnation of Socrates for not holding the objects of the public worship to be gods. Any citizen in the enjoyment of free civic rights might bring the accusation, and the Archon Basileus was the magistrate who conducted the examination.

<head orig="Asia">Asia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσία</foreign>), in the poets <hi rend="bold">Asis</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσίς</foreign>). One of the three great divisions which the ancients made of the known world. It was first used by the Greeks for the western part of Asia Minor, especially the plains watered by the river Caÿster, where the Ionian colonists first settled; and thence, as their geographical knowledge advanced, they extended it to the whole country. The southern part of the continent was supposed to extend much farther to the east than it really does, while to the north and northeast parts, which were quite unknown, much too small an extent was assigned. The different opinions about the boundaries of Asia on the side of Africa are mentioned under <ref type="cross" target="crossafrica">Africa;</ref> on the side of Europe the boundary was formed by the river Tanais (Don), the Palus Maeotis (Sea of Azof), Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea), Propontis (Sea of Marmora), and the Aegean (Archipelago). The most general division of Asia was into two parts, which were different at different times, and known by different names. To the earliest Greek colonists the river Halys, the eastern boundary of the Lydian kingdom, formed a natural division between <hi rend="SmallCaps">Upper</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lower Asia;</hi> and afterwards the Euphrates was adopted as a more natural boundary. Another division was made by the Taurus into <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia intra Taurum</hi>, i. e. the part of Asia north and north west of the Taurus, and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia extra Taurum</hi>, all the rest of the continent. The division ultimately adopted, but apparently not till the fourth century of our era, was that of <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia Maior</hi> and <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia Minor</hi>. (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia Maior</hi> was the part of the continent east of the Tanaïs, the Euxine, an imaginary line drawn from the Euxine to Trapezus (Trebizond), to the Gulf of Issus and the Mediterranean; thus it included the countries of Sarmatia Asiatica, with all the Scythian tribes to the east, Colchis, Iberia, Albania, Armenia, Syria, Arabia, <cb /> Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Media, Susiana, Persia, Ariana, Hyrcania, Margiana, Bactriana, Sogdiana, India, the land of the Sinae, and Serica; respecting which, see the several articles.</p>
 <p>(2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia Minor</hi> (Anatolia) was the peniusula on the extreme west of Asia, bounded by the Euxine, Aegean, and Mediterranean on the north, west, and south; and on the east by the mountains on the west of the upper course of the Euphrates. It was divided into Mysia, Lydia, and Caria, on the west; Lycia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia, on the south; Bithynia, Paphlagonia, and Pontus, on the north; and Phrygia, Pisidia, Galatia, and Cappadocia, in the centre.</p>
 <p>(3) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Asia Propria</hi>, or simply <ref type="cross" target="crossasia">Asia</ref>, the Roman province formed out of the kingdom of Pergamus, which was bequeathed to the Romans by Attalus III. (B.C. 130), and the Greek cities on the western coast, and the adjacent islands, with Rhodes.

<head orig="Aspasia">Aspasia</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀσπασία</foreign>). (1) A celebrated woman, a native of Miletus. She came as an adventuress to Athens, in the time of Pericles, and, by the combined charms of her person, manners, and conversation, completely won the affection and esteem of that distinguished statesman. Her station had freed her from the restraints which custom laid on the education of the Athenian matron, and she had enriched her mind with accomplishments which were rare even among men. Her acquaintance with Pericles seems to have begun while he was still united to a lady of high birth, and we can hardly doubt that it was Aspasia who first disturbed this union, although it is said to have been dissolved by mutual consent. But after parting from his wife, who had borne him two sons, Pericles attached himself to Aspasia by the most intimate relation which the laws permitted him to contract with a foreign woman; and she acquired an ascendency over him which soon became notorious, and furnished the comic poets with an inexhaustible fund of ridicule and his enemies with a ground for serious charges. The Samian War was ascribed to her interposition on behalf of her birthplace, and rumours were set afloat which represented her as ministering to the vices of Pericles by the most odious and degrading of offices. There was, perhaps, as little foundation for this report <figure id="fig.00141">
<head orig="Aspasia. (Vatican.)">Aspasia. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> as for a similar one in which Phidias was implicated ( <title>Pericl.</title> 13); though among all the imputations brought against Pericles, this is that which it is the most difficult clearly to refute. But we are inclined to believe that it may have arisen from the peculiar nature of Aspasia's private circles, which, with a bold neglect of established usage, were composed not only of the most intelligent and accomplished men to be found at Athens, but also of matrons, who, it is said, were brought by their husbands to listen to her conversation. This must have been highly instructive as well as brilliant, since Plato did not hesitate to describe her as the preceptress of Socrates, and to assert in the <title>Menexenus</title> that she both formed the rhetoric of Pericles and composed <cb /> one of his most admired harangues, the celebrated funeral oration. The innovation, which drew women of free birth and good standing into her company for such a purpose, must, even where the truth was understood, have surprised and offended many, and it was liable to the grossest misconstruction. And if her female friends were sometimes seen watching the progress of the works of Phidias, it was easy, through his intimacy with Pericles, to connect this fact with a calumny of the same kind.</p>
 <p>There was another rumour still more dangerous, which grew out of the character of the persons who were admitted to the society of Pericles and Aspasia. No persons were more welcome at the house of Pericles than such as were distinguished by philosophical studies, and especially by the profession of new philosophical tenets. The mere presence of Anaxagoras, Zeno, Protagoras, and other celebrated men, who were known to hold doctrines very remote from the religious conceptions of the vulgar, was sufficient to make a circle in which they were familiar pass for a school of impiety. Such were the materials out of which the comic poet Hermippus formed a criminal prosecution against Aspasia. His indictment included two heads: an offence against religion, and that of corrupting Athenian women to gratify the passions of Pericles. The danger was averted; but it seems that Pericles, who pleaded her cause, found need of his most strenuous exertions to save Aspasia, and that he even descended, in her behalf, to tears and entreaties, which no similar emergency of his own could ever draw from him.</p>
 <p>After the death of Pericles, Aspasia attached herself to a young man of obscure birth, named Lysicles, who rose through her influence in moulding his character to some of the highest employments in the Republic. (See Plut. <title>Pericl.;</title>  <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2. 6." default="NO" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Mem.</title>ii. 6.</bibl>) </p>
 <p>(2) Daughter of Hermotimus, and a native of Phocaea in Asia Minor. She was so remarkable for her beauty that a satrap of Persia carried her off and made her a present to Cyrus the Younger. Her modest deportment soon won the affections of the prince, who lived with her as with a lawful wife. Her name at first was Milto (vermilion), which had been given her in early life on account of the brilliancy of her complexion. Cyrus, however, changed it to Aspasia, calling her thus after the mistress of Pericles. After the death of the prince she fell into the hands of Artaxerxes, who for a long time vainly sought to gain her affections. She only yielded at last to his suit through absolute necessity. When the monarch declared his son Darius his successor, the latter, as it was customary in Persia for an heir to ask a favour of him who had declared him such, requested Aspasia of his father. Aspasia was accordingly sent for, and, contrary to the king's expectation, made choice of Darius. Artaxerxes therefore gave her up, in accordance with established custom, but soon took her away again, and made her a priestess of Artemis at Ecbatana, or of the goddess whom the Persians called Anaïtis. This station required her to pass the rest of her days in chastity ( <title>Artax.</title>). Justin, however, says (x. 1) that Artaxerxes made her one of the priestesses of the sun.

The country properly so called, in the narrowest sense, was a district of Asia, extending along the east side of the Tigris, which divided it on the west and northwest from Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and bounded on the north and east by Mount Niphates and Mount Zagrus, which separated it from Armenia and Media, and on the southeast by Susiana. It was watered by several streams flowing into the Tigris from the east, two of which, the Lycus or Zabatus (Great Zab) and the Caprus or Zabas (Little Zab), divided the country into three parts. The district between the upper Tigris and the Lycus , called Atturia, was probably the most ancient seat of the monarchy, containing the capital, Nineveh or Ninus. The Lycus and the Little Zab bounded the finest portion, called Adiabené. The district southeast of the Little Zab contained the two subdivisions Apolloniatis and Sittacené. In a wider sense the name Assyria was used to designate the whole country watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, including Mesopotamia and Babylonia; and in a still more extended application it meant the whole Assyrian Empire, one of the first great states of which we have any record.</p>

In 1872 the late Mr. George Smith, of the British Museum, discovered a series of tablets containing an epic in twelve books, one of which relates to the legend of the Deluge, and bears a very striking resemblance to the account given in the Old Testament. In both accounts the Deluge is a punishment for human sins; in both, the builder of an ark gathers into it his family and the beasts of the field; in both, the ark rests upon a mountain; in both, peace between God and man is restored; and in both, a sign of the restoration is the appearance of the rainbow. Many other interesting resemblances to portions of the Book of Genesis are contained in the Assyrian tablets. The hymns and prayers are likewise beautiful and poetic.</p>

It has been learned that the Assyrians were acquainted with glass; that they employed the arch in building; that they used the lens as a magnifying instrument; and had, among other mechanical appliances, the lever and the roller.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Religion</hi>.—The religion of Assyria was simpler than that of the Babylonians, although polytheistic in character. The national deity was Assur, regarded as the founder 
<pb n="144" /><cb />
 of the nation. Beside him there are two principal triads, with many minor deities. The first triad is known as the Nature Triad (Ann “the Progenitor,” Bel “the Lord of the World,” Hea “the Lord of the Sea, Rivers, and Fountains”). The second triad is the Celestial Triad (Sin the Moon-god, Shamas the Sun-god, Istar the Stargoddess). Minor gods are Merodach or Marduk, son of Hea; Nebo the god of learning, who possesses many of the attributes of the Greek <ref type="cross" target="crosshermes">Hermes</ref> (q.v.); and Nergal and Nusku the war-gods. (See 2 Kings, xvii. 30.)</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">History</hi>.—Ancient accounts of Assyrian history are those of <ref type="cross" target="crossberosus">Berosus</ref> (q.v.), a Graeco-Chaldean priest, who wrote at Babylon, where he had access to the inscriptional records, about B.C. 268; of Herodotus; and of Ctesias of Cnidus, physician to the Persian king Artaxerxes Mnemon (B.C. 405). The narrative of Berosus has met with much confirmation from recent excavations and explorations. In the Bible narrative we are told that Nineveh was founded from Babylonia. “Out of that land [Babylonia] he [Nimrod] went forth into Assyria” (Gen. x. 11)—and this statement is fully confirmed by the results of recent explorations. The earliest inscriptions found on the bricks from Assur (Kileh-Shergat), the ancient capital, give to the first rulers of the land the Akkadian title of Patesi, or “high-priest of the city of Assur,” and to the city itself the Akkadian name of Pal-bi-ki. The next notice of Assyria does not occur until the Assyrian king Pul, or Tiglath-pileser II., invaded Palestine, and was bought off by Menahem, king of Israel (B.C. 738). In the same reign we find the Jewish king Jehoahaz (Ahaz) becoming a vassal of the court of Assyria, and the tribes beyond Jordan carried away captive (B.C. 734). In B.C. 722, Samaria is captured by Sargon the Tartan, who had usurped the throne from his weak master, Shalmaneser IV. The next reference to Assyria is that of the siege and capture of Jerusalem by Sargon (Isaiah, x., xi., xx.), and the siege of Ashdod (B.C. 712-711). This event is now proved to be distinct from the siege by Sennacherib in B.C. 701, which terminated apparently in a disaster for the Assyrian army. The last mention of Assyria is the record of the murder of Sennacherib by his sons in B.C. 681, and the accession of his faithful son Esar-haddon, the most powerful of all the Assyrian monarchs, for he carried his arms as far as the Mediterranean and conquered Egypt. Little credit is to be attached to the expedition of Holofernes recorded in the apocryphal Book of Judith.</p>
 <p>After this the Empire appears to have gradually decayed, until at last, in the reign of Assur-banipal or Sardanapalus, or that of Esar-haddon II. (Sarakos), a league for its destruction was formed between Nabopolassar, governor of Babylon, and Cyaxares, king of Media, which was strengthened by the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar, son of the former, to Nitocris, daughter of the latter. The <cb /> war and siege are said to have been interrupted by an invasion of the Scythians, which drew off Cyaxares; but at length Nineveh was taken and destroyed about B.C. 605, or, according to Rawlinson, 625. In the time of Darius Hystaspes Assyria rebelled without success in conjunction with Media. In the time of Herodotus the capital had ceased to exist; and when Xenophon passed it the very name was forgotten, though he testifies to the extent of the deserted city, and asserts the height of the ruined walls to be 150 feet. An inconsiderable town seems to have existed on its ruins in the reign of Claudius; and the last notice we have of Nineveh in the classics is in Tacitus.</p>
 <p>The fanciful history related by Ctesias is now found to be based on distorted Graeco-Persian traditions; and though the writer managed to make the ancient world give credit to him in preference to Herodotus, his work is now proved to be very untrustworthy. According to him, for thirty generations after Ninyas the kings led a life of luxury and indolence in their palace; the last of them, Sardanapalus, made a vigorous defence against Ar<figure id="fig.00144">
<head orig="Assyrian Dwellings. (Relief from Kouyunjik.)">Assyrian Dwellings. (Relief from Kouyunjik.)</head>
</figure> baces, the rebel governor of Media, but, finding it impossible to defend Nineveh, he set fire to his palace, and burned himself with all his treasures. This event took place 1306 years after Ninus. Now, the above account represents Nineveh to have perished nearly three centuries before the real date, which was about B.C. 606, and is utterly incompatible with Scripture. Herodotus assigns to the Empire a duration of 520 years, and Berosus of 526. In order to reconcile these conflicting accounts, historians have supposed that Nineveh was twice destroyed, but this supposition is now generally rejected. However, that part of Nineveh was actually destroyed by fire is proved by the condition of the slabs and statues found in its ruins, which show the action of intense heat.</p>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀστρονομία</foreign>) and <hi rend="bold">Astrologia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀστρολογία</foreign>). These terms were at first synonymous expressions among the ancients, both signifying “the science of the stars.” But afterwards astrology came to mean that part of the science which deals with the supposed influence of the stars on the destinies of men. Among the Greeks, astronomy, the origin of which they themselves ascribed to the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, was for centuries the subject of philosophical speculation without a sufficient groundwork in observation, because mathematics and mechanics had not reached the requisite degree of perfection. The list of observing astronomers opens with Eudoxus of Cnidus in the first half of the fourth century B.C., who assumed that the earth was spherical, and tried to explain the phenomena of the heavens by a complicated theory of concentric spheres. Aristotle, too, maintained and proved the spherical form of the earth, which he took to be the immovable centre of the universe. Astronomy was first raised into a real science after B.C. 300 at Rhodes and Alexandria, in the Museum of which town the first observatory was built; and Aristyllus and Timochares determined the places of the fixed stars with comparative accuracy, though as yet with very rude apparatus. A great step in advance was taken by Aristarchus of Samos, who observed the summer solstice at Alexandria in B.C. 279, maintained the earth's rotation on her axis and revolution round the sun, and made an attempt, by no means contemptible, to ascertain the size and distance of the sun and moon. His successor Eratosthenes also rendered essential service to the progress of the science; thus, he came very near 
<pb n="146" /><cb />
 to determining the exact obliquity of the ecliptic. The true founder of scientific astronomy, and the greatest independent observer of antiquity, was Hipparchus of Nicaea (in the second century B.C.), who discovered the precession of the equinoxes, and determined the length of the solar year (at 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, 12 seconds), as well as the time of the moon's revolution, and the magnitude and distances of the heavenly bodies. The last important astronomer of antiquity, and the greatest after Hipparchus, is Claudius Ptolemaeus in the second century A.D. In his chief work, commonly known by its Arabic name of <title>Almagest</title>, he digested the discoveries of his predecessors, especially Hipparchus, and his own into a formal system, which passed current all through the Middle Ages. According to it the earth is a sphere resting motionless in the middle of the equally spherical universe, while the sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars roll at various distances around her.</p>
 <p>The Romans regarded astronomy as an idle speculation, and gave little attention to it. When Iulius Caesar reformed the Roman calendar he was obliged to bring an astronomer, Sosigenes, from Alexandria to help him.</p>
 <p><hi rend="SmallCaps">Astrology</hi>, in the narrower sense of the word, and applied to predictions based upon the observation of the heavenly bodies, arose among the Chaldaeans, and in Greece did not come into vogue until after the time of Alexander the Great. In Rome the professional astrologers were called Chaldaei, or Mathematici, the latter name referring to the astronomical calculations which they made. In the Republican period they were known, but held in utter contempt. In B.C. 139 their unpopularity was so great that they were expelled from Rome and Italy. But in the turbulent times of the civil wars their reputation rose considerably, and still more under the Empire, when the most extensive demands were made upon their science. They were, indeed, repeatedly driven out of Italy and involved in trials for treason (<seg lang="la">maiestas</seg>); but this only enhanced the consideration in which they were held, the more so as they were frequently taken into counsel by the emperors and the members of the imperial family. In later times all that the Chaldaeans were forbidden to do was to consult the stars on questions referring to the emperor's life, which was made a criminal offence. The Christian emperors (but none before them) issued many prohibitions against all consultation of astrologers whatever.</p>
 <p>In the practice of their art they used calendars written on tablets, in which were set down for every day the motion and relative distances of the stars, whether lucky or unlucky. By another set of tablets they made their calculations of every hour in detail, noting the hour of a person's birth and the relative position of the constellation dominant at the time. In accordance with this they determined the fortunes of him who was born at the hour in question. By a similar process they ascertained the times that were favourable or unfavourable to any undertaking. Among the lucky stars were Iupiter, Venus, and Luna; among the unlucky, Saturn and Mars were the chief. Mercury was lucky or unlucky, according to circumstances.</p>

 <p>(1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Arcadian Version</hi>. Atalanta, daughter of Zeus and Clymené, was exposed by her father, who had desired male offspring only. She was suckled by a bear, until she was found and brought up by a party of hunters. Under their care she grew up to be a huntress—keen, swift, and beautiful. She took part in the Calydonian boarhunt, was the first who struck the boar, and received from Meleager the head and skin of the beast as the prize of victory. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossmeleager">Meleager</ref>.) She is also associated with the voyage of the Argonauts. She turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of her numerous suitors; but at last she propitiated the wrath of Aphrodité by returning the faithful love of the beautiful Milanion, who had followed her persistently, and suffered and struggled for her. Their son was Parthenopaeus, one of the Seven against Thebes. Swinburne's poem, <title>Atalanta in Calydon</title>, gives a magnificent setting to the story. 
<pb n="147" /><cb />
 (2) <hi rend="SmallCaps">The Boeotian Version</hi>. Atalanta was the daughter of Schoenens, son of Athamas, and distinguished for beauty and swiftness of foot. An oracle warned her against marriage, and she accordingly lived a lonely life in the forest. She met the addresses of her suitors by challenging them to race with her, overtaking them in the race and spearing them in the back. She was at length beaten, however, by Hippomenes, who during the race dropped on the ground three golden apples given him by Aphrodité. Atalanta stooped down to pick up the apples, and thus lost the race. Hippomenes forgot to render thanks to Aphrodité, and the goddess in anger caused the pair in their passion to profane the sanctuary of Cybelé, where they were changed into lions. See W. S. Landor's <title>Hippomenes and Atalanta.</title>

<head orig="Até">Ate</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄτη</foreign>). According to Homer, the daughter of Zeus; according to Hesiod, of Eris (or Strife). She personifies infatuation, the infatuation being generally held to imply guilt as its cause and evil as its consequence. At first she dwelt on Olympus; but after she had entrapped Zeus himself into his rash oath on the occasion of the birth of <ref type="cross" target="crossheracles">Heracles</ref> (q.v.), he hurled her down to earth. Here she pursues her mission of evil, walking lightly over men's heads, but never touching the ground. Behind her go the Litai (Prayers), the lame, wrinkled, squinting daughters of Zeus. The Litai, if called upon, heal the hurts inflicted by Até; but they bring fresh evil upon the stubborn. In later times Até is transformed into an avenger of unrighteousness, like Diké, the Erinyes, and Nemesis.

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossgaius">Gaius</ref>. A Roman jurist of the age of Augustus and Tiberius, who was born about B.C. 30, and died about A.D. 22. Unlike his contemporary Antistius <ref type="cross" target="crosslabeo">Labeo</ref> (q.v.), he recommended himself to the ruling powers by his submissive attitude. He was rewarded by many tokens of distinction; among others, by the consulship, to which he was elected in A.D. 5, before attaining the legal age. As a jurist (again unlike Antistius) he represented the conservative tendency, and so became the founder of a special school called the <title>Sabiniani</title>, after his pupil Masurius Sabinus, and opposed in its theory of legal interpretation to the radical school of Proculus.

Athamas, as the murderer of his son, was obliged to flee from Boeotia, and settled in Thessaly. Hence we have Athamantiades, son of Athamas, i. e. Palaemon; and Athamantis, daughter of Athamas, i. e.

<div2 id="crossathanasius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Athanasius">Athanasius</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθανάσιος</foreign>). A Christian bishop of the fourth century. He was a native of Egypt, and a deacon of the Church of Alexandria under Alexander the Bishop, whom he succeeded in his dignity A.D. 326. Previous to his obtaining this high office he had been private secretary to Alexander, and had also led for some time an ascetic life with the renowned St. Anthony. Alexander had also taken him to the council at Nice, where he gained the highest esteem of the fathers by the talent which he displayed in the Arian controversy. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossarius">Arius</ref>.) He had a great share in the decrees passed here, and thereby drew on himself the hatred of the Arians. On his advancement to the prelacy he dedicated all his time and talents to the doctrine of the Trinity, and resolutely refused the request of Constantine for the restoration of Arius to the Catholic communion. In revenge for this refusal, the Arian party brought several accusations against him before the emperor. Of these he was acquitted in the first instance; but, on a new charge of having detained ships at Alexandria, laden with corn for Constantinople, either from conviction or policy, he was found guilty and banished to Gaul. Here he remained in exile eighteen months, or, as some accounts say, upwards of two years, his see in the meantime being unoccupied.</p>
 <p>On the death of Constantine he was recalled, and restored to his functions by Constantius; but the Arian party made new complaints against him, and he was condemned by 90 Arian bishops assembled at On the opposite side, 100 orthodox bishops, assembled at Alexandria, declared him innocent; and Pope Iulius confirmed this finding, in conjunction with more than 300 bishops assembled at Sardis from the East and West. In consequence of this, he returned a second time to his diocese. But when Constans, emperor of the West, died, and Constantius became master of the whole Empire, the Arians again ventured to rise 
<pb n="148" /><cb />
 up against Athanasius. They condemned him in the councils of Arles and Milan, and, as the worthy patriarch refused to listen to anything but an express command of the emperor, when he was one day preparing to celebrate a festival in the church, a body of soldiers suddenly rushed in to make him prisoner. The surrounding priests and monks, however, placed him in security. Athanasius, displaced for a third time, fled into the deserts of Egypt. His enemies pursued him even here, and set a price on his head. To relieve the hermits, who dwelt in these solitary places and who would not betray his retreat, from suffering on his account, he went into those parts of the desert which were entirely uninhabited. He was followed by a faithful servant, who, at the risk of his life, supplied him with the means of subsistence. In this undisturbed spot Athanasius composed many writings, full of eloquence, to strengthen the faith of the believers or expose the falsehoods of his enemies. When Julian the Apostate ascended the throne, he allowed the orthodox bishops to return to their churches. Athanasius, therefore, returned after an absence of six years. The mildness which he exercised towards his enemies was imitated in Gaul, Spain, Italy, and Greece, and restored peace to the Church. But this peace was interrupted by the complaints of the heathen, whose temples the zeal of Athanasius kept always empty. They excited the emperor against him, and he was obliged to fly to the Thebaïs to save his life. The death of the emperor and the accession of Jovian again brought him back; but on Valens becoming emperor eight months after, and the Arians recovering their superiority, he was once more compelled to fly. He concealed himself in the tomb of his father, where he remained four months, until Valens, moved by the pressing entreaties and threats of the Alexandrians, allowed him to return. From this period he remained undisturbed in his office until he died, in A.D. 373.</p>
 <p>Of the forty-six years of his official life, he spent twenty in banishment, and the greater part of the remainder in defending the Nicene Creed. Athanasius is one of the greatest men of which the Church can boast. His deep mind, his noble heart, his invincible courage, his living faith, his unbounded benevolence, sincere humility, lofty eloquence, and strictly virtuous life, gained the honour and love of all. His writings are on polemical, historical, and moral subjects. The polemical treat chiefly of the doctrines of the Trinity, the incarnation of Christ, and the divinity of the Holy Spirit. The historical ones are of the greatest importance for the history of the Church. In all his writings the style is distinguished, considering the age in which they were produced, for clearness and moderation. His apology, addressed to the emperor Constantine, is a masterpiece. The creed which bears his name is now generally allowed not to have been his. It was first printed in Greek in 1540, and several times afterwards to 1671. It has been questioned whether this creed was ever received by the Greek and Oriental Churches. In America the Episcopal Church has rejected it. The best edition of Athanasius is in the <title>Patrologia Graeco-Latina</title> of Migne <bibl default="NO">(1860)</bibl>. His epistles and some of his orations were translated with notes by J. H. Newman <bibl default="NO">(1842)</bibl>.

<head orig="Athēnae">Athenae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθῆναι</foreign>). The chief city of Attica. The long southeastern triangle of the northern peninsula of Greece, which terminates in the abrupt <cb /> promontory of Sunium (mod. Cávo Colónnais), has its most interesting and important division, topographically as well as historically, on the western side, facing the Saronic Gulf. Here, at a point midway between Sunium and the promontory that faces Salamis, the low Cape Zoster terminates the Anhydros range, a lower continuation of Hymettus. The long continuous ridge of Anhydros and Hymettus (1027 metres at its greatest height) extends, in a slightly northeasterly direction, towards the range of Pentelé (<foreign lang="greek">Πεντέλη</foreign>), the ancient Brilessos (<foreign lang="greek">Βριλησσός</foreign>) or Pentelicon (<foreign lang="greek">Πεντελικόν</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">ὄρος</foreign>, Lat. Mons Pentelicus), from which it is separated by the pass through which the modern railway runs southeasterly towards the ancient mines of Laurium, near Sunium. The Pentelicus range (1086.6 metres high) extends northwest and southeast, and forms with Hymettus and Anhydros a well-nigh continuous dividing-wall between the eastern plain of Attica, the Mesogaea (<foreign lang="greek">Μεσόγαια</foreign>), and the middle plain; while the plain of Marathon in the northeast is approachable from the Mesogaea only by a narrow way between Pentelicus and the sea towards Euboea, and from the middle plain by two difficult mountain ways between Pentelicus and Parnes. This last range (1412 metres high) lies to the northwest of Pentelicus and extends nearly east and west. Passable only by way of Decelea (mod. Tatóï) in the east and Phylé in the west, it effectually cuts off Attica from Boeotia. In its furthest extent towards the west, where it continues in the Cithaeron range, it divides the western Attic plain, the Eleusinian, from Boeotia. The middle Attic plain is separated from the Eleusinian by a lower mountain mass, Aegaleos (<foreign lang="greek">Αἰγάλεως</foreign>) or Corydallos (<foreign lang="greek">Κορυδαλλός</foreign>) (467 metres high), which, leaving easy way between itself and Parnes, continues southwest, broken midway by the pass of Daphné, till it terminates in “the rocky brow which looks o'er sea-born Salamis.” Within these natural ramparts lies that which we may call <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg> the Attic plain, a great V-shaped recess open towards the sea. Its more important internal features, which, taken in connection with its enclosed character on the one hand and its free access to the sea on the other, rendered it an ideal theatre for the development of a Greek state, we must now examine in detail.</p>
 <p>From the offshoots of Parnes and Pentelicus in the northeast rises the most considerable waterway of the plain—the Cephissus, which afforded in ancient as in modern times a perennial source of irrigation for the fields of the Attic farmer. As it approaches the sea, below the heights of the city, it seems to have been met by another stream from the east—the Ilissus, which, rising from Hymettus, is in modern times, owing to the denudation of its parent mountain, a much more insignificant stream than in ancient times, hardly more than a dry bed in summer. Hence the difficulty of determining its entire course. The Eridanus mentioned by ancient authors seems to have been a stream from the delicious and wholesome fountain of Kaisariané (<foreign lang="greek">Καισαριανή</foreign>, anc. <foreign lang="greek">Κυλλοῦ πήρα</foreign>), southeast of the sources of the Ilissus, into which the stream emptied east of the city.</p>
 <p>Between the Cephissus and the Ilissus, about midway of the plain, a short range of hills, formed like the other heights of the plain of bluish-gray limestone and bearing to-day the name Tourkovoún 
<pb n="149" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00149">
<head orig="Plan of Athens.">Plan of Athens.</head>
</figure> (<foreign lang="greek">Τουρκοβούνι</foreign>, “Turk Mountain,” anc. perh. <foreign lang="greek">Ἀγχεσμός</foreign>) (339 metres high), terminates at the southwest in the bold separate peak of Lycabettus (277 metres high), from the pyramidal summit of which, crowned by a chapel of St. George, one commands the most splendid view of the Attic plain, the gulf with its islands, and the Peloponnesian mountains beyond. Some 1000 paces to the southwest of this height, too sharp and steep for habitation, rises a double group of hills of about half the height of Lycabettus. The first and highest of these is the famous Acropolis, the citadel of Athens (156 metres high). Under its western brow <figure id="fig.00149.2">
<head orig="View of the Acropolis in 1890. (From a photograph.)">Plan of Athens.</head>
</figure> <cb /> lies the lower rock of the Areopagus (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄρειος πάγος</foreign>, “Mars' Hill”) (115 metres high). From northwest to south of this extends the group of the Museum (<foreign lang="greek">Μουσεῖον</foreign>, “Muses' Hill”), the Pnyx, and the “Nymphs' Hill” (so called from an inscription), separated by depressions. The highest point is at the southeast extremity of the group, in the summit of the Museum (147 metres high), crowned by the monument of the Syrian Antiochus Philopappus. This triple group of hills seems to have been called collectively in ancient times Pnyx (<foreign lang="greek">Πνύξ</foreign>, “conglomeration”).</p>
 <p>Lycabettus, the Acropolis, and the Pnyx were 
<pb n="150" /><cb />
 manifestly formed by the action of water, which, forcing its way east and west, left the hard bluegray limestone projecting in three great protuberances, “like bones of a wasted body,” as Plato says.</p>
 <p>Between four and five English miles southwest of the Acropolis we find as outpost on the sea the rocky peninsula of Acté or Munichia, which, originally an island, like Salamis, was gradually united to the plain by the soil washed from above. North of it lies the secure landlocked harbour of Piraeus (<foreign lang="greek">Πειραιεύς</foreign>); east, the larger open roadstead of Phalerum (<foreign lang="greek">Φάληρον</foreign>), the earlier port of Athens, into which the Cephissus and Ilissus drain, and which is terminated on the southeast by Cape Colias (<foreign lang="greek">Κωλιὰς ἄκρα</foreign>).</p>
 <p>If we examine the soil of the plain from the sea inland, we find that the sandy coast is succeeded by a swampy alluvial strip, the Halipedon (<foreign lang="greek">Ἁλίπεδον</foreign>, “salt-plain” or “sea-plain”). This again gives place to the plain proper, which, though “light of soil” and requiring diligent cultivation, is yet the natural home of the olive, and is not ill adapted to the growth of wheat and vegetables. The stony foot-hills above the plain (<foreign lang="greek">Φελλεύς</foreign>) were terraced and utilized for the cultivation of the vine; while the fragrant mountain-plants, particularly of purple Hymettus, furnished pasturage not only for sheep, but for the bees that have made Attic honey proverbial. The fig-tree, too, was made to flourish so well in the plain that Attic figs were as famous as the oil and honey from the same region.</p>
 <p>To these resources we must add the abundance of potter's-clay, and the wealth of material for the architect and the sculptor afforded by the quarries of Pentelicus, Hymettus, and Eleusis, as well as by those of the hills of the city and the heights of Piraeus.</p>
 <p>In his efforts to wring from the soil its uttermost, the farmer was aided by a climate exceptionally favourable. In the Attic year there are, on the average, not more than thirty-five days on which the sun does not show itself; and though the north winds from snowy Parnes render the winter cold most penetrating, their steady breath by day during the greater part of the year, alternating with the equally steady sea-breeze by night, combined with a wonderful purity and dryness of air, gave to Attica—and still gives to her, though in a less degree—a climate at once physically and mentally exhilarating. Justly, then, might “the children of Erechtheus” be called “blessed of old, and children of the happy gods,” “lightly walking through brightest and clearest air,” where the goddess of all fertility “irrigated the soil from the streams of ever-flowing Cephissus, and breathed over them temperate breezes.”</p>
 <p>We turn now to the development of the little city which grew up in the midst of this exceptional environment.</p>
 <p>As in the case of other ancient Grecian settlements, so in that of Athens we find an avoidance of immediate proximity to the sea, such as would have been obtained by a settlement on the height of the Piraeus. The natural centre for the development of a town neither remote from the sea nor yet immediately accessible from it—such, too, as to be commanded by a natural asylum in the event of hostile inroads—is afforded, in the case of Athens, by the group of hills below Lycabettus. Not only do we find here a central and isolated position in <cb /> a plain set apart from the rest of the world by nature, but also, within a narrow compass, arable land with a water-supply, the material for the primitive artisan, and an airy and wholesome position for habitation upon a foundation of native rock, thus leaving the cultivable area unencumbered.</p>
 <p>It is not of special moment to us, in tracing the material development of the little community which has done more than any other towards the promotion of civilization, whether we give to the earliest inhabitants any other name than Athenians. The term Pelasgian itself needs interpretation; and, so far as any precise knowledge goes, we might as well regard these early occupants of the “land unsacked” as quite as truly an outgrowth of “the ground itself” as their symbolic cicada. It is evident from the mere consideration of their environment that we must accept the view of Thucydides, that Attica was exceptionally stable in population, and trace, so far as possible, the gradual accretions upon the primitive nucleus, by whatever name we choose to designate it.</p>
 <p>The earliest and most permanent traces of human habitation to be found at Athens are the foundations of houses cut in the rock of the group of hills designated by the general name of Pnyx. These are extensive enough to warrant the belief that this region, which in historical times lay waste for the most part, was the seat of a thriving town, according to the conditions of that primitive period. Whether the remarkable rock-cuttings and the semicircular Pelasgic wall upon the hill called <seg lang="la">par excellence</seg> Pnyx be the monuments of a prehistoric worship of the primeval god of the sunny sky of Greece as well as of its stormier phenomena, Zeus Hypsistos, or whether we are to see here, as has been the prevailing fashion, the place of the Athenian popular assembly (that which under the former supposition is the altar becoming under the latter the famous bema, from which the orators “shook th' arsenal and fulmin'd over Greece”), to any one who has been upon the ground the extreme antiquity of these imposing works is at once obvious. To the early period under discussion seem to belong also the rock-hewn chambers, one of which is traditionally known as the “Prison of Socrates”—an impossible designation.</p>
 <p>We cannot suppose that the inhabitants of this first rock-city, or Cranaa (<foreign lang="greek">Κρανάα</foreign>), concerned themselves with the sea, if at all, beyond the demands of their daily existence, which would hardly lead them beyond fishery. It was only enterprising accretions from without that could utilize and develop the entire resources of nature.</p>
 <p>Further traces of the early city are to be found in the ancient names, which, attached to the several districts in and about the later city, maintained themselves, not only in the mouth of the people, but in public records, through the entire history of Athens. Among the most certainly distinguishable of these primitive divisions (<foreign lang="greek">δῆμοι</foreign>) is that known, as far back as we can trace, as Ceramicus (<foreign lang="greek">Κεραμεικός</foreign>), so called from the potter's-clay which here furnished abundant material for one of the earliest of human industries. This region stretches northward from the rocky brow of the Areopagus. Melité (<foreign lang="greek">Μελίτη</foreign>) seems to have lain to the south of Ceramicus, and to have embraced the Hill of the Nymphs as well as the Areopagus. Collytus (<foreign lang="greek">Κολ-</foreign> 
<pb n="151" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00151">
<head orig="The Theseum.">The Theseum.</head>
</figure></p>
 <p><foreign lang="greek">λυτός</foreign>) stretched to the northeast of the Acropolis, bordering on the west not only upon Ceramicus, but also upon Melité, as seems proved by a mention of a boundary-stone in Strabo. Diomea (<foreign lang="greek">Διόμεια</foreign>) may be placed next to Collytus, and between the Acropolis and Lycabettus. Ceriadae (<foreign lang="greek">Κειριάδαι</foreign>), within the border of which, just below the precipice of the Nymphs' Hill, lay the depression, formed partly by nature, partly by quarrying, called the Barathrum (<foreign lang="greek">Βάραθρον</foreign>), adjoined Melité on the west; while Coelé (<foreign lang="greek">Κοίλη</foreign>), consonant with its name, occupied the gully between the Hill of the Nymphs and the bed of the Ilissus. The core of these ancient districts is the rock-city in Melité. To the north of Ceramicus, and, apparently, at all times outside the city limits, lay Colonos Hippios, called from its hill (<foreign lang="greek">κολωνός</foreign>).</p>
 <p>While the ancient city thus maintained itself in the little inland district just described, those influences were beginning to make themselves felt from the coast which were to govern the destiny of the future state. The Phoenician traders appear to have established their customary trading-posts at an early date not merely on Salamis (which has preserved its Phoenician name), but also on the coast opposite and on the heights of the Piraeus and Phalerum. Ancient rock-cuttings in the citadel of Piraeus seem to attest early settlement there. It was, indeed, such a position as we know, not only from Thucydides, but also from various material remains, to have been most likely to be chosen by these early navigators of the Mediterranean, and mediators between Orient and Occident. To this source, a mixed Oriental coast-settlement in which Phoenicians played the leading part, appears to be due the addition of Aphrodité and Heracles (Astarté and Melkart) to the primitive native worship of Zeus and the Nymphs, “daughters of aegisholding Zeus,” whose cult attached to springs and water-courses. The ritual of these two foreign <cb /> deities, as carried on in the historical period, certainly points to a very early introduction of their worship. As to the primitive worship of Zeus, reference has already been made to what may, not improbably, be deemed his primeval sanctuary on the Pnyx; concerning a second early seat of his worship, not far removed, we are better informed. Southeast of the Acropolis, above the fountain Callirrhoë and the bed of the Ilissus, was shown in ancient times an opening in the rock into which, according to the legend, the last vestiges of Deucalion's flood had sunk. Here Deucalion was said to have “built the ancient sanctuary of Olympian Zeus,” whose worship remained fixed at this spot through all the subsequent history of the city. Cleft rock and spring are fit emblems of the worship of Zeus and his daughters at this spot by the primeval Cranai.</p>
 <p>The gradual influences of the influx into Attica, both overland from the north and oversea from the west, may be traced in the gods added to the Athenian pantheon. The Minyan Artemis, the Pelasgic Hermes, the Thracian Ares who gave his name to the Areopagus, Hephaestus the handicraftsman's god, gradually encroached upon the domain of the older cults; while Poseidon gained a seat at Phalerum, and later disputed, according to the legend, the possession of the land with Athené, the intellectual development of the old Oriental mother-goddess, who retained her guardianship of the olive-tree even after she had resigned her care of the fields to Eleusinian Demeter.</p>
 <p>The incursions from the north and from the sea, which gradually brought in these new divinities, forced the growing state of the Cranai to take up a securer position on the rock of the Acropolis, which, falling off precipitously on all sides except the west, readily lent itself to the fortifications which the early inhabitants of Greece knew so 
<pb n="152" /><cb />
 well how to build, and which we can understand now that the ruins of Tiryns and Mycenae, as well as the Acropolis itself, have been submitted to careful excavation and study. Here, on the top of the rock, which was levelled and provided with retaining-walls, as well as with a surrounding fortification, was established the ancient Polis (<foreign lang="greek">Πόλις</foreign>, a term long retained as the official designation of the Acropolis), the seat of the worship of Zeus Polieus. Here, on the north side, where we now see the ruins of the later Erechtheum, were the old sanctuary of the local daemon Erechtheus and the palace of the royal race of the Cecropid and Erechtheid kings, the foundations of which, as well as of private dwellings of the same epoch, have been traced. Up to this palace led from the north a stairway, unearthed in the recent excavations, and in the enclosure west of the present Erechtheum was the sacred olive-tree, the gift of Athené, and <figure id="fig.00152">
<head orig="Ruins of the Olympeium.">Ruins of the Olympeium.</head>
</figure> hard by it the tomb of Cecrops, both under the protection of the old local nymph Pandrosos (Cecropium and Pandroseum). Under the northwest brow of the Acropolis, below the “long rocks” (<foreign lang="greek">μακραὶ πέτραι</foreign>), was the grotto of Pan; and still farther to the west, within the modern bastion of Odysseus, a spring called Clepsydra (<foreign lang="greek">Κλεψύδρα</foreign>, “she that hides her water”), popularly supposed to pass underground to Phalerum. This spring was and still is approached from above by a remarkable fortified winding stairway cut in the rock. Under the south face of the Acropolis were a cave and spring, with which the worship of the healer Asclepius came to be associated; and in the southwest spur of the sacred rock, whence Aegeus was said to have flung himself down, Athené was established as goddess of victory  (<foreign lang="greek">Νίκη</foreign>), worshipped in an uncouth primitive idol with the sacrifice of a perfect cow, as so beautifully represented on <cb /> the marble balustrade about the later Ionic temple.</p>
 <p>Thus by the sacred olive and the hollow in the rock with its mysterious trident-mark—where the waves could be heard when the south-wind blew— flourished the old priestly and kingly race, hemmed in not only by the wall of the Polis proper, but also, as it seems, by a lower wall enclosing the skirts of the Acropolis, and called from its nine gates Enneapylon (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐννεάπυλον</foreign>), the area within which and below the ramparts of the citadel was known as the Pelargicon (<foreign lang="greek">τὸ Πελαργικόν</foreign>). The main entrance was then, as it has always been perforce, at the west end of the citadel, a fortified way winding up towards the right, the ancient warrior's exposed side, below the bastion of Athené Niké.</p>
 <p>The Ionians who immigrated from across the Aegean brought in the Delian Apollo, the god of Ionic colonization and civilization. This new and important factor in the Athenian state established itself south of the Acropolis in what Thucydides regarded as old Athens, in the region called Cydathenaeum (<foreign lang="greek">Κυδαθήναιον</foreign>), extending some 2000 metres around the southeast flank of the Acropolis and up towards Lycabettus. Under the south face of the Acropolis, close to the later Dionysiac Theatre, the northern Dionysus of Eleutherae was established in the Lenaeum, near the sanctuary of the “public” Aphrodité (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀφροδίτη πάνδημος</foreign>). To the south of this seems to have lain the old marketplace, the <foreign lang="greek">ἀγορά</foreign> of the Ionic <foreign lang="greek">ἄστυ</foreign>. Here was established the first town-hall—the Prytaneum or Basileum—by which, under the auspices of Themis, the “sceptre-bearing” kings administered justice. The solemn court of murder, so soon as the taking of human life came to be recognized as a state offence, was established on the Areopagus, in a 
<pb n="153" /><cb />
 cleft beneath which the Eumenides (“the gracious”) —as the avengers of blood, the Erinyes, were here called—were solemnly worshipped. The bodies of the executed, as well as purificatory offerings and offscourings, were thrown into the deep recess of the Barathrum. Thus the highest priesthood was associated with the Acropolis, while the king came down to preside in his political function over the Ionic nobility of Cydathenaeum. The Thesean nobles, true to their Ionic instinct, encouraged closer intercourse with the sea, and Cydathenaeum was linked by a high-road to Phalerum, whence they trafficked abroad; whereas the influence of the Tyrian traders seems to have made itself felt upon the Cranaan city of Melité by a way leading up from the Salaminian Strait.</p>
 <p>In the meantime the germ of the later city was rapidly maturing in the industrial settlement northwest of the Acropolis in Ceramicus, which seems to have kept pace in its development with the growing opposition of the lower classes to the encroachments and extortions of the Ionic nobility. After the period of ferment followed by the Solonian legislation, at the opening of the sixth century, came the first great period of the Athenian state—the democratic despotism of the Pisistratidae.</p>
 <p>The centre of gravity of the city now shifted to the point at which it remained ever afterwards— to the centre of the settlement of the Ceramicus, which rapidly outgrew in importance the effete Cydathenaeum. Here was established the altar of the Twelve Gods, from which, as from the golden milestone of Rome, distances were reckoned; and here, too, was the focus of Athenian <foreign lang="greek">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign>. On the Acropolis, Pisistratus probably built the temple of Athené Polias, “the old temple,” on the site between the later Parthenon and Erechtheum, where its plan has lately been made out. From this period, too, we date the institution of the great Panathenaea and the carrying of the sacred ship from the outer Ceramicus around and into the citadel. Thus did Pisistratus add new glory to the cult of his patron goddess. Upon the terrace above Callirrhoë, Pisistratus began a great temple to Olympian Zeus, but did not carry out his ambitious design. He also built in, or led an aqueduct from, Callirrhoë, which thus became Enneacrunos (<foreign lang="greek">Ἐννεάκρουνος</foreign>, “the fountain with nine pipes”), and long continued to be, as it had been, the main water supply of the town. The encouragement, if not the introduction, of the Dionysiac worship, which bore such abundant fruit in the succeeding century, seems also to have been an object of especial care to Pisistratus.</p>
 <p>Close upon the downfall of the Pisistratidean tyrannis and the struggles of the Clisthenean reform came the Persian wars and the sack of the Acropolis by the barbarians. The remains of the ruined shrines of the pre-Persian period, with curious painted pediments of soft stone, and the statues of Parian marble, executed by artists under the patronage of the Pisistratidae, are among the most precious treasures brought to light by the excavation of the Acropolis.</p>
 <p>The wide-reaching schemes of naval empire which sprang from the fertile brain of Themistocles, who fostered the growth of the Athenian navy and first saw the strategic importance of the Piraeus, were destined never to be fully realized. <cb /> Before the Persian wars, Themistocles had caused the Piraeus to be fully fortified and made a strong naval station, invested with heavy fortress-walls about the citadel of Munichia, and with its harbours (Cantharos, the largest, Munichia, and Zea) narrowed and easily closed. After the devastation of the city, he whose merit it was that he “fastened the city to the Piraeus, the land to the sea,” would fain have made the Piraeus the centre of the new city-development—impregnable by land and sea. But the machinations of the Peloponnesians necessitated the hurried fortification of the old site with an effective wall, and thus enabled the conservative party of Aristides and Cimon to carry out their design of maintaining the “wheel-shaped” city about the Acropolis, with a separate porttown and naval station at the Piraeus.</p>
 <p>The Themistoclean wall, the successor of older fortifications, passed, as well as can be made out, over the Pnyx hill from the Barathrum to the peak of the Museum, skirted the Ilissus, which lay like a moat without it to the south, curved southeast of the Acropolis, coming around towards the northeast, so as to avoid the foot of Lycabettus, and finally passed from east to west across the plain, taking in the little water-courses from Lycabettus, and finally bending about to the point from which we started. It included Collytus and Diomea, cut Melité in twain, formed an “inner” and an “outer” Ceramicus, and excluded Coelé. The dimensions of the space thus enclosed were about 2000 metres east and west by 1500 metres north and south, the Acropolis lying some 500 metres nearer the south side. Of the gates, we note two in Melité—the Melitid Gate (<foreign lang="greek">Μελιτίδες πύλαι</foreign>) and the “Gate of the Horsemen” (<foreign lang="greek">Ἱππάδες πύλαι</foreign>); then the gate on the south leading to Phalerum (<foreign lang="greek">Ἰτωνίαι πύλαι</foreign>); the Gate of Diochares (<foreign lang="greek">Διοχάρους πύλαι</foreign>) and the Diomean Gate (<foreign lang="greek">Διομῂς πύλη</foreign>) in the east; the Acharnian Gate (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀχαρνικὴ πύλη</foreign>) in the north; and the Dipylon (<foreign lang="greek">Δίπυλον</foreign>), the most important, between the inner and outer Ceramici, where considerable remains of the ancient foundations are still to be seen. South of the last was the Piraic Gate (<foreign lang="greek">Πειραϊκὴ πύλη</foreign>).</p>
 <p>To unite the city thus fortified with the Piraeus, the Long Walls were begun, about B.C. 460—a northern, run from the Hill of the Nymphs to Munichia, and a southern, connecting the city with Phalerum. Between these, under Pericles, a second Piraic Wall was built, parallel to the northern, completing the system and linking city and port by a long double fortification—the <foreign lang="greek">σκέλη</foreign>, or “legs.”</p>
 <p>Without and near the gates, particularly the Dipylon, the dead were interred; and public funerals were solemnized over the ashes of military heroes in the outer Ceramicus. Beautiful remains of the tombs of the period succeeding the Periclean, but bearing abundant traces of the Phidian art, have been fortunately preserved to us near the Dipylon, and form one of the most striking monuments of the ancient city.</p>
 <p>To the Cimonian period seems to belong the imposing temple, the best preserved of all Greek buildings of classical times, on the hill overlooking the Ceramicus from the west—the so-called Theseum, not improbably to be named the Heracleum.</p>
 <p>On the Acropolis, in connection with a new and extensive plan of walling, levelling, and enlargement of area, preparations seem to have been made 
<pb n="154" /><cb />
 by Cimon for an imposing new temple on the site now occupied by the Parthenon. Here not only was the irregular edge of the precipice raised and reinforced by a high wall outside the Pelasgian rampart supporting a deep inner grading, but a heavy foundation was built up from the bed-rock as support for a great temple structure, destined not to be completed according to the original design. On the north side, also, the plateau of the Acropolis was built up and walled, drums of columns and portions of architraves being freely used in the construction of the wall, and architectural fragments, inscribed marble tablets, and even statues employed as grading material. The bastion of Niké was also newly fortified. Though the nature of Cimon's whole undertaking was decorative rather than strategic, it might yet be truly said that the Acropolis was walled by the Pelasgians and Cimon.</p>
 <p>Pericles, having at his disposal the treasures of the Attic League, which were transferred to Athens (B.C. 454) and apparently kept in the Opisthodomos—as the “ancient” Pisistratidean temple of the Polias, commonly called from its length the Hecatompedon (<foreign lang="greek">Ἑκατόμπεδον</foreign>), and apparently rebuilt, at least in part, on its original site, was henceforth termed—reared upon Cimon's foundation the new and magnificent Doric Parthenon (dedicated B.C. 438). The architecture was intrusted to Ictinus and the sculpture to Phidias, whose chryselephantine statue of the Parthenos adorned the room to which alone the term Parthenon (“the virgin's chamber”) strictly applied. The Propylaea (q. v.), a massive ornamental entrance to the Acropolis, in which the Doric and Ionic styles were happily blended, rose under the guidance of the brilliant architect Mnesicles; and, <figure id="fig.00154">
<head orig="The Acropolis and the Wall of Themistocles.">The Acropolis and the Wall of Themistocles.</head>
</figure> <cb /> although never completed according to the architect's design, it remained among the greatest wonders of the city.</p>
 <p>Of the host of statues of all kinds which fast thronged the Acropolis, particularly during the fifth century—among them the great bronze statue of Athené as champion (<foreign lang="greek">πρόμαχος</foreign>), the bronze figure of the Wooden Horse, the heifer of Myron, and many others mentioned by ancient writers—we can take but passing notice. Their number was constantly increasing down to the times of the Roman Empire.</p>
 <p>Some time in the period covered by the first Athenian empire the stately little Ionic temple of Athené Niké seems to have been reared upon the southwest bastion of the Acropolis, and surrounded on three sides with the exquisite marble balustrade, fragments of which are still preserved on the Acropolis.</p>
 <p>The new Erechtheum, with its famous porch of the Maidens or Caryatides, was in course of construction at the close of the fifth century. See p. 112.</p>
 <p>The agora of the inner Ceramicus, bounded on the south by the abrupt brow of the Areopagus, under which stood the statues of the Eponymi, the namesake-heroes of the ten Clisthenean tribes, seems to have been divided by a line of stone Hermae into a northern and a southern half. About the southern half stood various public buildings, the Council-hall (<foreign lang="greek">Βουλευτήριον</foreign>), the Royal Stoa (<foreign lang="greek">Στοὰ Βασίλειος</foreign>), the Painted Stoa (<foreign lang="greek">Στοὰ ποικίλη</foreign>), the Metroön, the temple of Apollo Patroös, as well as the altar of the Twelve Gods and the statues of the democratic heroes Harmodius and Aristogiton. In its wider extent the agora of Ceramicus is bounded on the west by the hill of the so-called Theseum, and on the east 
<pb n="155" /><cb /> <figure id="fig.00155">

</figure>
 by the gate of Athené Archegetis. Its chief existing monument is the later Stoa of Attalus, king of Pergamos. The mention of these public works needs to be complemented by a word in regard to private structures. The dwelling-houses of the city during the period of Athenian greatness stood in striking contrast with the public structures. Built along narrow, irregular, and ill-kept streets, they gave but little indication of the social position <figure id="fig.00155.2">
<head orig="The Acropolis. View Taken from the Olympieum.—Evening Effect.">The Acropolis. View Taken from the Olympieum.—Evening Effect.</head>
</figure> <cb /> or wealth of their occupants. In this respect the old city seems to have been inferior to the Piraeus, which was better laid out and contained more sumptuous private buildings. At all times, however, in both towns, houses and house-furniture were, for the most part, extremely simple, and the bustling open-air life of the male population was not conducive to private luxury. See <ref type="cross" target="crossdomus">Domus</ref>.</p>
 <p>The Long Walls, destroyed at the close of the Peloponnesian War, were re-erected at the birth of the new Athenian empire, under which, and during the subsequent period of the Hellenistic successors of Alexander, the state received further adornment. Lycurgus completed the great stone theatre within the Lenaeum, overlapping the ancient Orchestra or “dancing-ring,” traces of which are still discernible. The Street of the Tripods, winding about the southeastern foot of the <ref type="cross" target="crossacropolis">Acropolis, is still marked by the delicate choragic monument</ref> (q.v.) of Lysicrates (B.C. 334). The Stoa of Eumenes lies 
<pb n="156" /><cb />
 to the west of the great theatre. The eastern side of the market of Ceramicus is marked by the great stone bazaar of Attalus, previously noticed. Building was carried on by Antiochus Epiphanes till his death (in B.C. 164) upon the site of the old sanctuary of Zeus on the Ilissus, where Hadrian finally reared his colossal Corinthian temple, the few remaining columns of which (the <foreign lang="greek">στῦλοι</foreign>) are one of the most prominent Athenian landmarks. Near it, towards the Acropolis, Hadrian set the gate, still standing, which should separate, according to its inscription, “the Athens of Theseus” from “the Athens of Hadrian.” An octagonal tower with waterclock within and weather-vane on the summit, and bearing on its several faces reliefs representing the winds (Horologium or “Tower of the Winds”), was erected by Andronicus Cyrrhestes (q. v.) southeast of the agora, where it still stands. The famous Herodes Atticus built, in honour of his dead wife Regilla, the great Odeum, adjoining the Stoa of Eumenes, under the southwestern slope of the Acropolis. These are among the most prominent monuments of the later Greek and the GraecoRoman period that still attract the visitor to the ancient site.</p>
 <p>The subsequent history of the monuments is one of rapine, defacement, and destruction. The traces of the Valerian wall, forming a great loop north of the Acropolis, and the mediaeval and modern fortifications, that have been removed from the approach to the Acropolis, are melancholy witnesses to barbarian invasion, mediaeval slavery, and the struggle of reawakening liberty. The archives of the story of the material growth and development of the Athens that has influenced the world had been laid up for a curious posterity long before these structures arose.</p>

<head orig="Athēné">Athene</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀθήνη</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Pallas Athēné.</hi> A Greek goddess, identified with the Roman Minerva. According to the story most generally current, she was the daughter of Zeus, who had swallowed his first wife, Metis (Counsel), the daughter of Oceanus, in the fear that she would bring forth a son stronger than himself. Hephaestus (or, according to another version, Prometheus) clave open the head of Zeus with an axe, on which Athené sprang forth in full armour, the goddess of eternal virginity. But her ancient epithet <foreign lang="greek">Τριτογένεια</foreign> (born of Triton, or the roaring flood) points to water—that is, to Oceanus —as the source of her being. Oceanus was, according to Homer, the origin of all things and of all deities. The worship of Athené and the story of her birth were accordingly connected with many brooks and lakes in various regions—especially in Boeotia, Thessalia, and Libya—to which the name Triton was attached.</p>
 <p>From the first, Athené took a very prominent place in the Greek popular religion. The Homeric hymns represent her as the favourite of her father, who refuses her nothing. When solemn oaths were to be taken, they joined her name with those of Zeus and Apollo, in a way which shows that the three deities represent the embodiment of all divine authority. With the exception of the two gods just mentioned, there is no other deity whose original character as a power of nature underwent so remarkable an ethical development. Both conceptions of Athené, the natural and the ethical, were intimately connected in the religion of Attica, whose capital, Athens, was named after Athené and was the most important seat of her worship. Athené was originally the maiden daughter of the god of heaven; the clear transparent aether, whose purity is always breaking forth in unveiled brilliancy through the clouds that surround it. As a deity of the sky, she, with Zeus, is the mistress of thunder and lightning. Like Zeus, she carries the <ref type="cross" target="crossaegis">aegis</ref> (q.v.) with the Gorgon 's head, the symbol 
<pb n="157" /><cb />
 of the tempest and its terrors. In many statues, accordingly, she is represented as hurling the thunder-bolt. But she also sends down from sky to earth light and warmth and fruitful dew, and with them prosperity to fields and plants. A whole series of fables and usages, belonging especially to the Athenian religion, represent her as the helper and protector of agriculture. The two deities Erechtheus and Erichthonius, honoured in Attica as powers of the fruitful soil, are her fosterchildren. She was worshipped with Erechtheus in the temple named after him the Erechtheum, the oldest sanctuary on the Athenian Acropolis. The names of her earliest priestesses, the daughters of Cecrops—Aglaurus, Pandrosus, and Hersé—signify the bright air, the dew, and the rain, and are mere personifications of their qualities, of such value to the Athenian territory.</p>
 <p>The sowing season was opened in Attica by three sacred services of ploughing. Of these, two were in honour of Athené as inventress of the plough, while the third took place in honour of Demeter. It was Athené, also, who had taught men how to attach oxen to the yoke; above all, she had given them the olive-tree, the treasure of Attica. This tree she had made to grow out of the rock of the citadel, when disputing the possession of the land with Poseidon. Several festivals, having reference to these functions of the goddess, were celebrated in Attica—the Callynteria and Plynteria, the Scirophoria, the Arrhephoria or Hersephoria, and the Oschophoria, which were common to Athené with Dionysus. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossdionysia">Dionysia</ref>.) Even her chief feast, the Panathenaea, was originally a harvest festival. It is significant that the presentation of the <foreign lang="greek">πέπλος</foreign> or mantle, the chief offering at the celebration, took place in the sowing season. But afterwards more was made of the intellectual gifts bestowed by the goddess.</p>
 <p>Athené was very generally regarded as the goddess of war—an idea which in ancient times was the prevailing one. It was connected with the fact that, like her father, Zeus, she was supposed to be able to send storms and bad weather. In this capacity she appears in story as the true friend of all bold warriors, such as Perseus, Bellerophon, Iason, Heracles, Diomedes, and Odysseus. But her courage is a wise courage, not a blind rashness like that of Ares; and she is always represented, accordingly, as getting the better of him. In this connection she was honoured in Athenian worship mainly as a protector and defender; thus (to take a striking example), she was worshipped on the citadel of Athens under the name of <foreign lang="greek">Πρόμαχος</foreign>, “champion,” “protector.” But she was also a goddess of victory. As the personification of victory (Athené Niké) she had a second and especial temple on the Athenian Acropolis. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossacropolis">Acropolis</ref>.) And the great statues in the temples represented her, like Zeus, with Niké in her outstretched hand. The occupations of peace, however, formed the main sphere of her activity. Like all the other deities who were supposed to dispense the blessings of nature, she is the protectress of growing children; and, as the goddess of the clear sky and of pure air, she bestows health and keeps off sickness. Further, she is (with Zeus) the patroness of the Athenian <foreign lang="greek">φρατρίαι</foreign> or unions of kinsfolk. At Athens and Sparta she protects the popular and deliberative assemblies; in many places, and especially at <cb /> Athens, the whole State is under her care (Athené Polias, Poliuchus). Elsewhere she presides over the larger unions of kindred peoples. The festival of Athené Itonia at Coronea was a confederate festival of all Boeotia. Under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Παναχαΐς</foreign> she was worshipped as the goddess of the Achaean League.</p>
 <p>Speaking broadly, Athené represents human wit and cleverness, and presides over the whole moral and intellectual side of human life. From her are derived all the productions of wisdom and understanding, every art and science, whether of war or of peace. A number of discoveries, of the most <figure id="fig.00157">
<head orig="Athené. (Vatican Museum.)">Athene. (Vatican Museum.)</head>
</figure> various kinds, is ascribed to her. It has been already mentioned that she was credited with the invention of the plough and the yoke. She was often associated with Poseidon as the inventress of horse-taming and ship-building. In the Athenian story she teaches Erichthonius to fasten his horses to the chariot. In the Corinthian story she teaches Bellerophon to subdue Pegasus. At Lindus in Rhodes she was worshipped as the goddess who helped Danaüs to build the first fifty-oared ship. In the fable of the Argonauts it is she who instructs the builders of the first ship, the Argo. Even in Homer all the productions of women's 
<pb n="158" /><cb />
 art, as of spinning and weaving, are characterized as “works of Athené.” Many a <foreign lang="greek">Παλλάδιον</foreign>, or statue of Pallas, bore a spindle and distaff in its left hand. As the mistress and protectress of arts and handiwork, she was worshipped at the Chalkeia, or Feast of Smiths, under the title of <foreign lang="greek">Ἐργάνη</foreign>. Under this name, too, she is mentioned in several inscriptions found on the Acropolis. Her genius covers the field of music and dancing. She is inventor of the flute and the trumpet, as well as of the Pyrrhic war-dance, in which she was said to have been the earliest performer, at the celebration of the victory of the Gods over the Giants.</p>
 <p>It was <ref type="cross" target="crossphidias">Phidias</ref> (q.v.) who finally fixed the typical representation of Athené in works of art. Among his numerous statues of her, three —the most celebrated —were set up on the Acropolis of Athens. These were: (1) The colossal statue of Athené Parthenos, wrought in ivory and gold, thirty feet in height (with the pedestal), and standing in the Parthenon. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossparthenon">Parthenon</ref>.) The goddess was represented wearing a long robe falling down to the feet, and on her breast was the aegis with the Gorgon 's head. A helmet was on her head; in one hand she bore a Victory, six feet in height, in the other a lance, which leaned against a shield adorned with scenes from the battles of the Amazons with the Giants.</p>
 <p>(2) The bronze statue of Athené Promachos, erected from the proceeds of the spoils taken at Marathon, and standing between the Propylaea and the Erechtheum. The proportions of this statue were so gigantic that the gleaming point of the lance and the crest of the helmet were visible to seamen on approaching the Piraeus from Sunium.</p>
 <p>(3) The Lemnian Pallas, so named because it had been dedicated by the Athenian colonists in Lemnos. The attractions of this statue won for it the name of “the Beautiful.” Like the second, it was of bronze; being a representation of Athené as the goddess of peace, it was without a helmet.

<head orig="Athlētae">Athletae</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀθληταί, ἀθλητῆρες</foreign>). A term in strictness applied to those who contended for prizes (<foreign lang="greek">ἆθλα</foreign>) in the games which required strength, skill, and agility of body, in contradistinction to 
<pb n="159" /><cb />
 those who engaged in equestrian and musical contests; though in a general sense it is found extended even to these.</p>
 <p>The contests of the athletae were in running, wrestling, boxing, the pentathlon, and the pancratium. Details of these will be found in the separate articles Lucta; <ref type="cross" target="crosspancratium">Pancratium</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspentathlon">Pentathlon</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crosspugilatus">Pugilatus</ref>; <ref type="cross" target="crossstadium">Stadium</ref>.</p>
 <p>In early times in Greece, athletic games were held occasionally at festivals in honour of the gods and heroes, but especially at the funerals of distinguished men; thus in the <title>Iliad</title> (xxiii.) games are held at the funeral of Patroclus. But the warriors, as a rule, do not appear to have trained especially for the games; since, as part of their general education, they had been instructed in gymnastics. In this department, Grecian legend told how Heracles, Peleus, and Theseus had been celebrated, as were also Castor and Pollux; but in the Homeric Age there were few who made athletics as such their especial business, though we must not forget the passage ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 8. 164" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>viii. 164</bibl>) where Euryalus reproaches Odysseus as not being “like an athlete.” Games were becoming fairly frequent, and the special skill required in the contests was gradually demanding increased application to the different branches of athletics.</p>
 <p>In the next age, athletics became the national Hellenic sport, and never ceased to be so till the latest times of the ancient world; for, in the first instance, they satisfied the artistic instinct of the Greeks, as they developed the human frame in strength and beauty. But as it was the national sport, like horse-racing in England, every department tended to become more and more professionalized. The great festivals collected together the greatest concourses of the members of the Hellenic race; and the emulation to succeed before the immense gatherings of their countrymen, and the extravagant honours and rewards bestowed by the cities on their citizens when victorious, rendered victory in the games the most coveted distinction a Greek could acquire; so that every means was resorted to in order to attain the strength and skill necessary for success.</p>
 <p>Euripides (<title>Autol.</title> Frag. 1) speaks with bitter contempt of the athletes, who, he says, are the greatest of the countless evils of Hellas, who are slaves to their belly, a degenerate lot, useless in war, unable to bear old age or misfortune—for their training is not an ennobling training.</p>
 <p>The athletic contests, just as are the “weights” in the ring in this country, were divided into “light” (<foreign lang="greek">κοῦφα</foreign>) and “heavy” (<foreign lang="greek">βαρέα</foreign>) or “violent” (<foreign lang="greek">βίαια</foreign>). See Aristot. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5. 4" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Pol.</title>v. 4</bibl><bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 7" default="NO" valid="yes"> Pol., 7</bibl> foll.; Galen. vi. 487, K.; <title>Gymn.</title> 3.</p>
 <p>The training in each of the two main classes became severer and severer as time went on; for more and more striking performances were expected. We hear of a rule that the competitors at Olympia had to swear that they had diligently devoted ten months to the recognized special training in athletics (Pausan. v. 24, 9). This was to maintain that common system of athletic training which prevailed in all Hellenic wrestling-schools. The ordinary gymnastic master who taught the youths bodily exercises as a branch of general education was called <foreign lang="greek">παιδοτρίβης</foreign>, and he who trained those who were intending to compete in the games was the <foreign lang="greek">γυμναστής</foreign>; but this distinction disappeared in later times. The <foreign lang="greek">γυμναστής</foreign> was in constant <cb /> supervision of his pupils, followed them to the games (Pausan. v. 6, 8), where he made all necessary preparations for their contest, and during the struggle stood by with words of encouragement or reproach ( <title>Gymn.</title> 20). Just as a physician, a trainer required implicit obedience in those for whom he prescribed (Epictet. <title>Enchir.</title> 29). Subordinate to him was the <foreign lang="greek">ἀλείπτης</foreign>, who originally, as his name indicates, looked to the anointing of the body; but often, especially in later times, took much more upon himself, became confused with the <foreign lang="greek">παιδοτρίβης</foreign>, and used to prescribe the course of diet to be eaten, and even how it was to be eaten. The diet of athletes is said to have been fresh cheese, dried figs, and wheat; but Dromeus of Stymphalus, or, according to others, a trainer called Pythagoras, introduced a meat diet. However, it is very unlikely that the athletes were ever trained on anything but meat. Pork was the principal meat used, though we find also beef and goat's flesh. Fish was considered bad. They probably drank water and not wine after their exercises, as the latter was dangerous; and they had to abstain from all cakes. The bread they ate was of a particular kind, slightly leavened and hardly baked at all. The usual course was to eat bread for the morning meal and meat for the evening. After the morning meal their exercises continued till the evening, interrupted only by a few intervals (Galen. vi. 168-169). Those who submitted to the severest training (<foreign lang="greek">βίαιος τροφή, ἀναγκαιοφαγία, ἀδηφαγία</foreign>) had to eat enormous masses of meat after the day's exercise: two minae (=2 2/3 lbs.) was a very small amount for an athlete, who generally slept it off late into the next day (Galen. i. 28, K.), though we sometimes hear of athletes promoting digestion by walking ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 11.  283" default="NO" valid="yes">Plin. <title>H. N.</title>xi. 283</bibl>). Many athletes did really eat vast quantities of food; so much, in fact, that their appetite became proverbial ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 34" default="NO" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title>, 34</bibl>).</p>
 <p>The exercises which athletes went through were the ordinary ones of the palaestra and those required for the games; though we sometimes find athletes going through exercises which were not departments of competition, merely in order to increase their strength, such as putting heavy weights, bending bars of iron, wrenching back the necks of bulls, knocking suspended bags of sand backwards and forwards by blows of their fists (<foreign lang="greek">κωρυκοβολία</foreign>), and also working with a mattock. The athletes practised, as a rule, each for a separate event. Hence the one-sidedness even of their physical training, and the fact that those who trained for that event which comprised the most varied exertions (such as the pentathlon), were justly considered to have the best-proportioned frames. But sometimes the athletes attempted more than one; for it was considered a great honour to be victorious at Olympia in both wrestling and in the pancratium on the same day. There were only seven such victors besides their mythic predecessor, Heracles. A certain Polites conquered on the same day in the three different kinds of races—the stadion, the diaulos, and the dolichos (Pausan. vi. 13, 3).</p>
 <p>Victors in the principal games were called <foreign lang="greek">ἱερονῖκαι</foreign>; those in the separate games, <foreign lang="greek">ὀλυμπιονῖκαι</foreign>, etc.; and those who were successful in all four games were the <foreign lang="greek">περιοδονῖκαι</foreign>. In Roman times, however, we find this latter term applied to celebrated athletes who had been victors in a great 
<pb n="160" /><cb />
 number of games, even though they were not the four great ones. Another strange title of distinguished athletes at Rome was <foreign lang="greek">παραδοξονίκης</foreign>, which was strictly applied to those who conquered in both wrestling and the pancratium.</p>
 <p>In early times, the athletes used to practise in the gymnasium, where the young men who had made some progress in gymnastics, and were advanced from the palaestra, went through their ordinary unprofessional exercises. In Roman times we find the athletes frequenting the palaestrae, the gymnasia, <seg lang="la">xysti</seg> (covered places for use in bad weather), and the stadia. There were also exercising places in the great Roman <ref type="cross" target="crossbalneae">balneae</ref> (q.v.).</p>
 <p>Originally the athletes used to contend with a girdle around their loins (<foreign lang="greek">διάζωμα, περίζωμα</foreign>, or simply <foreign lang="greek">ζῶμα</foreign>), according to the custom of the Spartans; but very soon it became the custom to contend naked. It was professional for Roman athletes to wear their hair tied up in a knot called <seg lang="la">cirrus.</seg> The Greek as well as the Roman athletes used sometimes to shave off their hair in that tonsure which Aristophanes called “the bowl crop” (<foreign lang="greek">σκαφίον</foreign>, <title>Thesm.</title> 838). Further, they occasionally wore a cap (<seg lang="la">galericulum</seg>); and as their wonderful style of boxing consisted in swinging round their arms and not striking out straight from the shoulder, they used to wear guards for the ears (<foreign lang="greek">ἀμφωτίδες</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ἐπωτίδες</foreign>). For the battered ears of ancient boxers, see <title>Protag.</title> 342 B; <bibl n="Mart.  7. 32" default="NO" valid="yes">Mart.vii. 32</bibl><bibl n="Mart.  5." default="NO" valid="yes">Mart., 5.</bibl></p>
 <p>He who took to the profession of an athlete seldom abandoned it before his thirty-fifth year, which was considered the age at which he was in the prime of manhood; but if he had never won a victory by that time he generally gave up the business. A successful athlete continued to contend in the games till his strength failed ( <title>Cat. Mai.</title> 4); and, as might be expected, in many cases, as he advanced in years, became a trainer of younger men: e. g. Iccus (Pausan. vi. 10, 5).</p>
 <p>To be an Olympic victor, said Cicero, was esteemed by the Greeks a greater glory than a triumph at Rome. And indeed, the victorious Greek athlete used to have a kind of triumphal entry into the town his victory had ennobled. Surrounded by a large crowd, sometimes with a grand procession of chariots, clad in a purple mantle like a king, he drove into the city through a breach made in the wall for his chariot to pass through—a symbol that cities which possessed such citizens had no need of walls ( <bibl n="Luc. Symp. 2. 5" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Symp.</title>ii. 5</bibl>). Then followed the banquet, during which the victor heard his praises sung by a lyrical chorus and in the verse of the greatest poets of the day. Contests which involved the honour of such a triumphal entry were technically called <foreign lang="greek">ἀγῶνες εἰσελαστικοί</foreign>, which in early times were the four great festivals only; but in Imperial Rome this privilege was extended to other games ( <title>Epist.</title> x. 119, 120). Solid material rewards, too, were given. Even as reduced by Solon, the money reward which the Athenians gave the victor in the Olympic games was 500 drachmae, and 100 to the victor in any of the other games; sometimes he received maintenance in the Prytaneum and the honour of the first seat in the assemblies and theatre (<foreign lang="greek">προεδρία</foreign>, Xenophan. <title>Frag.</title> 2, 7, ed. Bergk). Statues were often erected to him in his native city and at Olympia. In fact, Plato goes so far as to say ( <bibl n="Plato Rep. 5. 465" default="NO"> <title>Rep.</title>v. 465</bibl>D) that the victor at the <cb /> Olympic games enjoyed a blessed life (<foreign lang="greek">βίος μακαριστός</foreign>).</p>
 <p>Yet among the many judgments passed by the ancients on the athletes we can find scarcely any that are favourable. Allusion has been made to the strictures of Xenophanes and Euripides, who attack them for their uselessness to the state and for their want of cultivation. Even from the physical point of view their training appeared to thoughtful men of science utterly bad. Plato sees in the athletes a habit of body which is sleepy and very subject to disease, which is too highly and extravagantly trained, and which unfits them for social or political duties. They are without information, cultivation, or grace of manner; hard and brutal, all violence and fierceness (ib. 410, 411). Aristotle declares that the habit of body of athletes is not suitable for that vigorous physical condition which a citizen should have, nor for health and the procreation of children. It is too one-sided, and the discipline which developes it is too severe. Plutarch disapproves of the <foreign lang="greek">ἰσχὺς παλαιστική</foreign> and of athletic training generally.</p>
 <p>We must now hastily review the rise of athletic games at Rome. Exhibitions of gladiators, not of athletes, were the national sport. Cicero says to M. Marius of the athletic contests exhibited by Pompeius in B.C. 55, “Why should I think you regretted not having seen the athletes, when you have despised the gladiators?” A certain kind of athletics had indeed been indigenous in Italy from the earliest times ( <bibl n="Liv.  1. 35" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.i. 35</bibl>), and we hear of contests in wrestling and boxing at the Roman games; but the whole practice was utterly unsystematic (cf.  <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 45" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>45</bibl>), and so quite unlike the elaborate manner in which it was cultivated in Greece. It was from Greece that the scientific practice of athletics came. In B.C. 186 M. Fulvius Nobilior gave the first exhibition of professional Greek athletes at Rome ( <bibl n="Liv.  39. 22" default="NO" valid="yes">Liv.xxxix. 22</bibl>). We do not, however, hear of a similar exhibition again till Sulla 's time, but there were a few others during the last century of the Republic. Varro complains,<figure id="fig.00160">

<pb n="161" /><cb />
 indeed, of there being a gymnasium at every villa (<title>R. R.</title> ii. 1, 1); but this was probably for medicinally prescribed exercises (<seg lang="la">iatraliptice</seg>), not regular athletics. But it was not till the Actian games were established by Augustus, and other periodic games (Dio Cass. li. 1) which comprised gymnastic contests in their programme, that athletics got a steady footing among the Romans. From that time these <title>certamina Graeca</title>, as they were called ( <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14. 21" default="NO" valid="yes">Tac. <title>Ann.</title>xiv. 21</bibl>), became more and more popular. Nero in A.D. 60 built a gymnasium and instituted a new set of games called Neronia, of which athletics formed a part, as they did also of the important Agon Capitolinus established by Domitian in A.D. 86, who further built a magnificent stadium for athletics in the Campus Martius, large enough to hold 30,000 spectators ( <bibl n="Suet. Dom. 4" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Dom.</title>4</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Dom. 5" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. Dom., 5</bibl>; Friedländer, p. 466). After this, athletics gradually attained increased prominence in the Roman games, till finally, in the fifth century, they supplanted the gladiatorial shows.</p>
 <p>It is highly noticeable, however, that the names of the athletes which are preserved in inscriptions are almost all Greek; not more than four or five being Roman (Friedländer, p. 472). Everything connected with athletics, technical terms and all, are Greek (cf. <bibl n="Juv.  3. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">Juv.iii. 68</bibl>). The reason is that for a long time it was considered quite unbecoming the Roman dignity to be an athlete. The nakedness of the Greeks offended the Roman sense of propriety ( <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 4. 33" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. <title>Tusc.</title>iv. 33</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 70" default="NO" valid="yes">Cic. Tusc., 70</bibl>). The Romans saw the uselessness for war of the athletic training, for they themselves had been, as Polybius says (i. 6, 6), “the true athletes in the feats of war, trained in contests with the Samnites and Gauls.”</p>
 <p>Like all other classes in the community under the Roman Empire, the athletes crystallized into societies or guilds (<foreign lang="greek">σύνοδοι</foreign>). They were well organized, had presidents called Xystarchi, and used to make provincial tours and give exhibitions (Friedländer, p. 475). The chief of these societies in the second century was that of the Herculanei (cf. <title>C. I. G.</title> 5906 foll.), who had their own special gymnasium, with its council-chamber (<seg lang="la">curia</seg>, Orelli, 2588), its records, its temple, and its president, who bore the title of <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχιερεύς</foreign>, and who was also overseer of the imperial baths.</p>
 <p>On athletics generally, the chief ancient work is Philostratus's <foreign lang="greek">Γυμναστικός</foreign> (see Kayser's Teubner text, ii. 261-293).

Partial <foreign lang="greek">ἀτιμία</foreign> involved only the forfeiture of some few rights, as, for instance, the right of pleading in court. Public debtors were suspended from their civic functions till they discharged their debt to the State.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄτλας</foreign>). “Bearer” or “Endurer.” The son of the Titan Iapetus and Clymené (or, according to another account, Asia), brother of Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. In Homer ( <bibl n="Homer Od. 1. 52" default="NO"> <title>Od.</title>i. 52</bibl>) he is called “the thinker of mischief,” who knows the depths of the whole sea, and has under his care the pillars which hold heaven and earth asunder. In Hesiod he stands at the western end of the earth, near where the Hesperides dwell, holding the broad heaven on his head and unwearied hands. To this condition he is forced by Zeus, according to a later version, as a punishment for the part which he took in the battle with the Titans. By the ocean nymph Pleioné he is father of the Pleiades, and by Aethra of the Hyades. In Homer, the nymph Calypso is also his daughter, <figure id="fig.00162">

As their knowledge of the West extended, the Greeks transferred the abode of Atlas to the African mountain of the same name. Local stories of a mountain which supported the heaven would, no doubt, encourage the identification. In later times, Atlas was represented as a wealthy king, and owner of the garden of the Hesperides. Perseus, with the head of Medusa, turned him into a rocky mountain for his inhospitality. In works of art he is represented as carrying the heaven, or (after the earth was discovered to be spherical) the terrestrial globe.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀτρεύς</foreign>). The son of Pelops and Hippodamia, grandson of Tantalus, and brother of Thyestes and Nicippé. He was first married to Cleola, by whom he became the father of Plisthenes; then to Aeropé, the widow of his son Plisthenes, who was the mother of Agamemnon, Menelaüs, and Anaxibia, either by Plisthenes or by Atreus; and lastly to Pelopia, the daughter of his brother Thyestes. The awful fate of the house of Pelops afforded materials to the tragic poets of Greece. In consequence of the murder of their half-brother Chrysippus, Atreus and Thyestes were obliged to take to flight. They were hospitably received at Mycenae; and, after the death of Eurystheus, Atreus became king of Mycenae. Thyestes seduced Aeropé, the wife of Atreus, and was in consequence banished by his brother. From his place of exile he sent Plisthenes, the son of Atreus, whom he had brought up as his own child, with orders to slay Atreus; but Plisthenes fell by the hands of Atreus, who did not know that he was his own son. In order to take revenge, Atreus, pretending to be reconciled to Thyestes, recalled him to Mycenae, killed his two sons, and placed their flesh before their father at a banquet, who unwittingly partook of the dreadful meal. Thyestes fled with horror, and the gods cursed Atreus and his house. The kingdom of Atreus was now visited by famine, and the oracle advised Atreus to call back Thyestes. Atreus, who went out in search of him, came to King Thesprotus, where he married his third wife, Pelopia, the daughter of Thyestes, whom Atreus believed to be a daughter of Thesprotus. Pelopia was at the time with child by her own father. This child, Aegisthus, afterwards slew Atreus, because the latter had commanded him to slay his own father, Thyestes. The oldest accounts of the Pelopidae do not mention the horrible stories that are generally connected with them.

<div2 id="crossattica" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Attĭca">Attica</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἀττική</foreign>). A division of Greece, in the form of a triangle, two sides of which are washed by the Aegaean Sea, while the third is separated from Boeotia on the north by the mountains Cithaeron and Parnes. Megaris, which bounds it on the northwest, was formerly a part of Attica. In ancient times it was called Acté and Acticé, or the “coast-land” (<foreign lang="greek">ἀκτή</foreign>), from which the later form, Attica, is said to have been derived. According to tradition, it derived its name from Atthis, the <cb /> daughter of the mythical king Cranaüs; and old-fashioned etymologists found in it the root which appears in that of the goddess Athené. Attica is divided by many ancient writers into three districts. (1) The Highlands, the northeast of the country.</p>
 <p>(2) The Plain, the northwest of the country, including both the plain round Athens and the plain round Eleusis, and extending south to the promontory Zoster.</p>
 <p>(3) The Seacoast District, the south part of the country, terminating in the promontory Sunium. Besides these three divisions, we also read of</p>
 <p>(4) the Midland District, still called Mesogia, an undulating plain in the middle of the country. The soil of Attica is not very fertile. The greater part of it is not adapted for growing corn; but it produces olives, figs, and grapes, especially the two former, in great perfection. The country is dry; the chief river is the Cephissus, rising in Parnes and flowing through the Athenian plain. The abundance of wild flowers in the country made the honey of Mount Hymettus very celebrated in antiquity. Excellent marble was obtained from the quarries of Pentelicus, northeast of Athens, and a considerable supply of silver from the mines of Laurium near Sunium. The territory of Attica, including the island of Salamis, which belonged to it, contained between 700 and 800 square miles; and the population in its flourishing period was probably about 500,000, of which nearly four fifths were slaves.</p>
 <p>Attica is said to have been originally inhabited by Pelasgians. Its most ancient political division was into twelve independent States, attributed to Cecrops, who, according to some legends, came from Egypt. Subsequently Ion, the grandson of Hellen, divided the people into four tribes, Geleoutes, Hopletes, Argades, and Aegicores; and Theseus, who united the twelve independent States of Attica into one political body and made Athens the capital, again divided the nation into three classes, the Eupatridae, Geomori, and Demiurgi. Clisthenes (B.C. 510) abolished the old tribes and created ten new ones, according to a geographical division; these tribes were subdivided into demes or townships.

 <p>A Roman of an old and wealthy equestrian family, born B.C. 109. He received a good education in boyhood and youth, and went in the year B.C. 88 to Athens, where he lived until 65, devoting himself entirely to study, 
<pb n="164" /><cb />
 and much respected by the citizens for his generosity and cultivated refinement. In 65, he returned to Rome, to take possession of the inheritance left him by his uncle and adoptive father, Q. Caecilius. He now became Q. Caecilius Pomponianus. From this time onward he lived on terms of intimacy with men like Cicero, Hortensius, and Cornelius Nepos (who wrote a life of him which we still possess). He avoided public life and the strife of parties. This fact, in addition to his general amiability and good nature, enabled him during the Civil Wars to keep on the best of terms with the leaders of the conflicting parties—Cicero, Brutus, and Antonius. He died after a painful illness, of voluntary starvation, in the year B.C. 32.</p>
 <p>Atticus was the author of several works, the most considerable of which was a history (<title>Liber Annalis</title>) dedicated to Cicero. This gave a short epitome of the bare events of Roman history down to B.C. 54, arranged according to the series of consuls and other magistrates, with contemporaneous notices. But his most important contribution to Latin literature was his edition of the letters which he had received from Cicero. He also did great service by setting his numerous slaves to work copying the writings of his contemporaries. In philosophy, he was an Epicurean. The fragments of the <title>Liber Annalis</title> will be found in Peter, <title>Hist. Frag.</title> 214.

<div2 id="crossattila" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 
<head orig="Attĭla">Attila</head>

 <p> (in German, Etzel). The son of Mundzuck, or, as he is less correctly called, Mandras, a Hun of royal descent, who succeeded his uncle Rugilas in A.D. 433, and shared the supreme authority with his brother Bleda. These two leaders of the barbarians who had settled in Scythia and Hungary threatened the Eastern Empire, and twice compelled Theodosius II. (q. v.) to purchase peace. Their power was feared by all the nations of Europe and Asia. The Huns themselves esteemed Attila their bravest warrior and most skilful general; while he gave out that he had found the sword of their tutelar god, the Scythian Mars, the possession of which was supposed to convey a title to the whole earth. He caused his brother Bleda to be murdered (A.D. 444); and when he announced that it had been done by the command of God, the murder was celebrated as a victory. Being now sole master of a warlike people, his unbounded ambition made him the terror of all nations; and he became, as he called himself, “the Scourge of God” for the chastisement of the human race. In a short time he extended his dominion over all the people of Germany and Scythia, and the Eastern and Western emperors paid him tribute. The Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Gepidae, and a part of the Franks united under his banners, so that some historians assure us that his army amounted to 700,000 men. His portrait, as given by Jornandes, was that of a modern Calmuc, with a large head, swarthy complexion, flat nose, small sunken eyes, and a short square body. His looks were fierce, his gait proud, and his deportment stern and haughty; yet he was merciful to a suppliant foe, and ruled his own people with justice and lenity.</p>
 <p>Having heard a rumour of the riches and power of Persia, he directed his march thither, but was defeated on the plains of Armenia, and fell back to satisfy his desire for plunder in the dominions of the Emperor of the East. He found a pretext <cb /> for war, went over to Illyricum, and laid waste all the countries from the Euxine to the Adriatic. The emperor Theodosius collected an army to oppose his progress; but in three bloody battles Fortune declared herself for the barbarians, and Constantinople was indebted to the strength of its walls and to the ignorance of the enemy in the art of besieging, for its preservation. Theodosius was at the mercy of the victor, and was compelled to purchase peace. A scheme was laid in the court of Theodosius to assassinate Attila under the cover of a solemn embassy, which intention he discovered; and, without violating the laws of hospitality in the persons of the ambassadors, wisely preferred a heavy ransom for the principal agent in the plot, and a new treaty at the expense of fresh payments. On the accession of Marcian, Attila demanded tribute, which was refused; and, although much exasperated, he resolved first to turn his arms against the Western emperor Valentinian, whose licentious sister Honoria, in revenge for being banished for an intrigue with her chamberlain, sent an offer of herself to Attila. The Hun, perceiving the pretence this proposal supplied, preceded his irruptions into Gaul by demanding Honoria in marriage, with a share of the imperial patrimony. Being refused, he affected to be satisfied, and pretended he was only about to enter Gaul to make war upon Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. He accordingly crossed the Rhine, A.D. 450, with a prodigious host, and marked his way with pillage and desolation, until completely defeated by Theodoric and the famous Aëtius in the bloody battle of Châlons (451). He, however, recruited his forces, and passed the Alps the next year, invading Italy and spreading his ravages over all Lombardy. This visitation was the origin of the famous republic of Venice, which was founded by the fugitives who fled at the terror of his name. Valentinian, unable to avert the storm, repaired from Ravenna to Rome, whence he sent the prelate Leo with a solemn deputation to avert the wrath of Attila, who consented to leave Italy on receiving a vast sum as the dowry of Honoria and an annual tribute. He did not much longer survive these transactions; and his death was singular, he being found dead, in consequence of suffocation from a broken bloodvessel, on the night of his marriage with a beautiful young virgin named Hilda (453). His body was enclosed in three coffins—the first of gold, the second of silver, and the third of iron. The captives who had made the grave were strangled, in order that the place of interment might be kept concealed from his foes.

<head orig="Attis">Attis</head>

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄττις</foreign>) or <hi rend="bold">Atys</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">Ἄτυς</foreign>). A mythological personage in the worship of the Phrygian goddess Cybelé-Agdistis. The son of this goddess, so ran the story, had been mutilated by the gods in terror at his gigantic strength, and from his blood sprang the almond-tree. After eating its fruit, Nana, daughter of the river Sangarius, brought forth a boy, whom she exposed. He was brought up first among the wild goats of the forests, and afterwards by some shepherds, and grew up so beautiful that Agdistis fell in love with him. Wishing to wed the daughter of the king of Pessinus in Phrygia, he was driven to madness by the goddess. He then fled to the mountains, and destroyed his manhood at the foot of a pine-tree, which received his 
<pb n="165" /><cb />
 spirit, while from his blood sprang violets to garland the tree. Agdistis besought Zeus that the body of her beloved one might know no corruption. Her prayer was heard; a tomb to Attis was raised on Mount Dindymus in the sanctuary of Cybelé, the priests of which had to undergo emasculation for Attis's sake. A festival of several days was held in honour of Attis and Cybelé in the beginning of spring. A pine-tree, felled in the forest, was covered with violets, and carried to the shrine of Cybelé as a symbol of the departed Attis. Then, amid tumultuous music and rites of wildest sorrow, they sought and mourned for Attis on the mountains. On the third day he was found again, the image of the goddess was purified from the contagion of death, and a feast of joy was celebrated, as wild as had been the days of sorrow. The poem of <ref type="cross" target="crosscatullus">Catullus</ref> (q.v.) which deals with the story of Attis, in galliambic metre, is one of the weirdest and most powerful productions in all literature. With regard to it, see Ellis's Catullus <bibl default="NO">(2d ed. 1889)</bibl>, and Grant <bibl default="NO">Allen's <title>Attis</title> (1893)</bibl>.

<head orig="Auctio">Auctio</head>

 <p> signifies generally “an increasing, an enhancement,” and hence the name is applied to a public sale of goods, at which persons bid against one another. As a species, <seg lang="la">auctio</seg> signifies a public sale of goods by the owner or his agent, or a sale of goods of a deceased person for the purpose of dividing the money among those entitled to it, which was called <seg lang="la">auctio hereditaria.</seg> The sale was sometimes conducted by an <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg>, or by a <seg lang="la">magister auctionis;</seg> and the time, place, and conditions of sale were announced either by a public notice (<seg lang="la">tabula, album</seg>), or by a crier (<seg lang="la">praeco</seg>).</p>
 <p>The usual phrases to express the notification of a sale are <seg lang="la">auctionem proscribere, praedicare;</seg> and to determine on a sale, <seg lang="la">auctionem constituere.</seg> The purchasers (<seg lang="la">emptores</seg>), when assembled, were sometimes <cb /> said <seg lang="la">ad tabulam adesse.</seg> The phrases signifying to bid are <seg lang="la">liceri, licitari</seg>, which was done either by word of mouth or by such significant hints as are known to all people who have attended an auction. The property was said to be knocked down (<seg lang="la">addici</seg>) to the purchaser. An entry was made in the books of the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> of the sale and the money due, and credit was given in the same books to the purchaser when he paid the money (<seg lang="la">expensa pecunia lata, accepta relata</seg>). Thus the book of the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> might be used as evidence for the purchaser, both of his having made a purchase and having paid for the thing purchased. If the money was not paid according to the conditions of sale, the <seg lang="la">argentarius</seg> could sue for it.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">praeco</seg> or crier seems to have acted the part of the modern auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings and amusing the company. Slaves, when sold by auction, were placed on a stone or other elevated thing, and hence the phrase <seg lang="la">homo de lapide emptus.</seg> It was usual to put up a spear (<seg lang="la">hasta</seg>) in auctions—a symbol derived, it is said, from the ancient practice of selling under a spear the booty acquired in war. The term <seg lang="la">asta publica</seg> is used in Italy at the present time to signify an auction. By the auctio, the Quiritary ownership in the thing sold was transferred to the purchaser.

 <p> A diviner by means of birds. The derivation of the word is uncertain. Some ancient grammarians derived it from <seg lang="la">avis</seg> and <seg lang="la">gero</seg> (Festus, s. v. <seg lang="la">augur;</seg> <title>ad Verg. Aen.</title> v. 523), in support of which we may mention the analogy of <seg lang="la">au-spex</seg> and <hi rend="italic">au-ceps</hi>, and the ancient forms <hi rend="italic">auger</hi> and <hi rend="italic">augeratus</hi> quoted by Priscian, i. 6. 36; and this derivation is now accepted by Mommsen, Marquardt, Bouché-Leclercq, and others. Of modern suggestions may be mentioned that of Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, connecting the word with the Umbrian <hi rend="italic">uhtur=auctor</hi> (cf. <seg lang="la">ius est augurum cum auctoritate conjunctum</seg>, <title>De Leg.</title> ii. 12, 31; and Nissen, <title>Das Templum</title>, p. 5); and that of Vaniček, from <seg lang="la">avis</seg> and the root <hi rend="italic">gar</hi> (found in Sanskrit and in <foreign lang="greek">γηρύειν</foreign>, <seg lang="la">garrire</seg>). Fick, and apparently Kuntze, connect it with <seg lang="la">augeo, augustus</seg> (cf. <seg lang="la">augustum augurium</seg> in Ennius), and take it to mean “assistant”; while Lange and Bréal see in the word the root <hi rend="italic">gush</hi> (as in <foreign lang="greek">γεύω</foreign>), and understand by it “an appreciator.” By Greek writers on Roman affairs, the augurs are called <foreign lang="greek">αὔγουρες, οἰωνοπόλοι, οἰωνοσκόποι, οἰωνισταί, οἰωνομάντεις, οἱ ἐπ οἰωνοῖς ἱερεῖς</foreign>.</p>
 <p>The augurs at Rome formed a priestly <seg lang="la">collegium</seg>, traditionally said to have been founded by Romulus, and in the most ancient times no transaction took place, either of a private or a public nature, without consulting the auspices, and hence we find the question asked in a well-known passage of Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 6.41" default="NO" valid="yes">vi. 41, 4</bibl>), “Auspiciis hanc urbem conditam esse, auspiciis bello ac pace, domi militiaeque omnia geri, quis est, qui ignoret?” But the private augur seems to have fallen into contempt. Thus Cicero, while arguing in favour of divination in general, follows Ennius in classing the <title>Marsus augur</title> with other impostors (<title>de Div.</title> i. 58, 132).</p>
 <p>The public augurs, on the other hand, are of great importance in Roman history. The collegium originally consisted of three patricians, of whom the king was one. During the regal period the number was doubled; in B.C. 300 it was raised to nine (four patricians and five plebeians); and in the last century of the Republic, under Sulla , to <figure id="fig.00166">
<head orig="Augur with Lituus. (Bas-relief in Museum, Florence.)">Augur with Lituus. (Bas-relief in Museum, Florence.)</head>
</figure> fifteen, and finally by Iulius Caesar to sixteen, a number which continued unaltered under the Empire. It can be shown that the college of augurs continued to exist until the end of the fourth century A.D. The office was, on account of its political importance, much sought after, and only filled by persons of high birth and distinguished merit. It was held for life, an augur not being precluded from holding other temporal or spiritual dignities. Vacancies in the collegium were originally filled <cb /> up by co-optation; but after B.C. 104 the office was elective, the tribes choosing one of the caudidates previously nominated. An <seg lang="la">augurium</seg> had to be taken before the augur entered upon his duties. In all probability the augurs ranked according to seniority, and the senior augur presided over the business of the collegium.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">insignia</seg> of the office were the <seg lang="la">trabea</seg>, a state dress with a purple border, and the <seg lang="la">lituus</seg> (q. v.), a staff without knots and curved at the top.</p>
 <p>The science of Roman angury was based chiefly on written tradition. This was contained partly in the <title>Libri Augurales</title>, the oldest manual of technical practice, and partly in the <title>Commenturii Augurales</title>, a collection of answers given in certain cases to the inquiries of the Senate. In ancient times the chief duty of the augurs was to observe, when commissioned by a magistrate to do so, the omens given by birds, and to mark out the <seg lang="la">templum</seg> or consecrated space within which the observation took place. The proceeding was as follows: immediately after midnight, or at the dawn of the day on which the official act was to take place, the augur, in the presence of the magistrate, selected an elevated spot with as wide a view as was obtainable. Taking his station here, he drew with his staff two straight lines cutting one another, the one from north to south, the other from east to west. Then to each of these straight lines he drew two parallel lines, thus forming a rectangular figure, which he consecrated according to a prescribed form of words. This space, as well as the space corresponding to it in the sky, was called a <seg lang="la">templum.</seg> (See <ref type="cross" target="crosstemplum">Templum</ref>.) At the point of intersection in the centre of the rectangle was erected the <seg lang="la">tabernaculum.</seg> This was a square tent, with its entrance looking south. Here the augur sat down, asked the gods for a sign according to a prescribed formula, and waited for the answer. Complete quiet, a clear sky, and an absence of wind were necessary conditions of the observation. The least noise was sufficient to disturb it, unless indeed the noise was occasioned by omens of terror (<seg lang="la">dirae</seg>), supposing the augur to have observed them, or to intend doing so. As he looked south the augur had the east on his left, the west on his right. Accordingly, the Romans regarded signs on the left side as of prosperous omen, signs on the right side as unlucky—the east being deemed the region of light, the west that of darkness. The reverse was the case in ancient Greece, where the observer looked northwards. In his observation of birds the augur did not confine himself to noticing their flight. The birds were distinguished as <seg lang="la">alites</seg> and <seg lang="la">oscines.</seg> The <seg lang="la">alites</seg> included birds like eagles and vultures, which gave signs by their manner of flying. The <seg lang="la">oscines</seg> were birds which gave signs by their cry as well as their flight, such as ravens, owls, and crows. There were also birds which were held sacred to particular gods, and the mere appearance of which was an omen of good or evil. The augur's report was expressed in the words <seg lang="la">aves admittunt</seg>, “the birds allow it”; or <seg lang="la">alio die</seg>, “on another day,” i. e. “the augury is postponed.” The magistrate was bound by this report. The science of augury included other kinds of auspices besides the observation of birds, a cumbrous process which had dropped out of use in the Ciceronian age. These were: (1) Signs in the sky (<seg lang="la">ex caelo</seg>). The most important and decisive were 
<pb n="167" /><cb />
 thunder and lightning. Lightning was a favourable omen if it appeared to the left of the augur, and flashed to the right; unfavourable, if it flashed from right to left. In certain cases, as, for example, that of the assembling of the Comitia, a storm was taken as an absolute prohibition of the meeting.</p>
 <p>(2) Signs from the behaviour of chickens while eating. It was a good omen if the chicken rushed eagerly out of its cage at its food, and dropped a bit out of its beak; an unfavourable omen if it was unwilling, or refused altogether, to leave its cage, or flew away, or declined its food. This clear and simple method of getting omens was generally adopted by armies in the field, the chickens being taken about in charge of a special functionary (<seg lang="la">pullarius</seg>).</p>
 <p>(3) Signs given by the cries or motion of animals, as reptiles and quadrupeds, in their course over a given piece of ground (<seg lang="la">signa pedestria</seg> or <seg lang="la">ex quadrupedibus</seg>).</p>
 <p>(4) Signs given by phenomena of terror (<seg lang="la">signa ex diris</seg>). These might consist in disturbances of the act of <hi rend="italic">auspicatio</hi>, such as the falling of an object, a noise, a stumble, a slip in the recitation of the formula; or a disturbance occurring in the course of public business, such as, for instance, an epileptic seizure taking place in the public assembly—an event which broke up the meeting.</p>
 <p>The two last-mentioned classes of signs were generally not asked for, because the former were usually, the latter always, unlucky. If they made their appearance unasked, they could not be passed over, if the observer saw them or wished to see them. Every official was expected to take auspices on entering upon his office, and on every occasion of performing an official act. Thus the words <seg lang="la">imperium</seg> and <seg lang="la">auspicium</seg> were often virtually synonymous. The <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg> were further divided, according to the dignity of the magistrate, into <seg lang="la">maxima</seg> and <seg lang="la">minora.</seg> The greatest <seg lang="la">auspicia</seg> were those which were taken by the king, dictator, consuls, praetors, and censors; the lesser were taken by aediles and quaestors. If two magistrates, though <seg lang="la">collegae</seg> (colleagues), were of unequal dignity—assuming, for instance, that a consul and a praetor were in the same camp—the higher officer alone had the right of taking the auspices. If the <seg lang="la">collegae</seg> were equal, the auspices <cb /> passed from one to the other at stated times. No public act, whether of peace or war (crossing a river, for instance, or fighting a battle), could be undertaken without auspices. They were especially necessary at the election of all officials, the entry upon all offices, at all Comitia, and at the departure of a general for war. They had, further, to be taken on the actual day and at the actual place of the given undertaking.</p>
 <p>The augurs always continued in possession of important functions. In certain places in the city, for instance on the Arx, and at the meetingplace of the Comitia, there were permanent posts of observation for taking the regular auspices. These places were put under the care of the augurs. Their boundaries might not be altered, nor the view which they commanded interfered with. The augurs had authority to prevent the erection of buildings which would do this. They had also the power of consecrating priests, as well as of inangurating a part of the localities intended for religious purposes, and the places where public business was carried on. They were always present at the Comitia, and were authorized, if the signs which they saw or which were reported to them justified the proceeding, to announce the fact and postpone the business. If the constitutional character of a public act was called in question, the college of augurs had the exclusive power of deciding whether there was a flaw (<seg lang="la">vitium</seg>), in it, or not. If there were, the act was necessarily <figure id="fig.00167.2">
<head orig="Augur wearing the Trabea. (British Museum.)">Augur wearing the Trabea. (British Museum.)</head>
</figure> annulled. The dress of the augur was usually the <seg lang="la">praetexta</seg> (q. v.), but sometimes (possibly on military expeditions) the <seg lang="la">trabea</seg>, as in the accompanying illustration.</p>
 <p>By the end of the republican period the augurs, and the whole business of the auspices, had ceased to be regarded as deserving serious attention.</p>

The modern town still contains many Roman remains, the most important of which are the town gates and a triumphal arch. In all, seventy cities in different parts of the Roman Empire were named Augusta, among them London (Londinium), which was sometimes styled Augusta Trinobantia from the British tribe, the Trinobantes ( <bibl n="Tac.

 <p> <ref type="cross" target="crossaurelius">Aurelius</ref>. One of the most renowned Fathers of the Christian Church, was born at Tagasté, a city of Africa, November 13th, A.D. 354, during the reign of the emperor Constantius II. He has related his own life in the work to which he gave the title of <title>Confessiones</title>, and it is from this source, together with the <title>Retractationes</title>, some of his letters, and the <title>Vita Possidii</title> of the semi-Pelagian Gennadius, that we derive our principal information respecting him. His parents sent him to Carthage to complete his education, but he disappointed their expectations by his neglect of serious study and his devotion to pleasure, for in his sixteenth year he became very fond of women. For fifteen years he was connected with one, by whom he had a son. He left her only when he changed his whole course of life. A book of Cicero's, the <title>Hortensius</title>, which has not come down to our times, led him to the study of philosophy; and when he found that this did not satisfy his feelings, he went over to the sect of the Manichaeans. He was one of their disciples for nine years; but, after having obtained a correct knowledge of their doctrines, he left them, and departed from Africa <cb /> to Rome, and thence to Milan, where he announced himself as a teacher of rhetoric. St. Ambrose was bishop of this city, and his discourses converted Augustine to the orthodox faith. The reading of St. Paul's epistles wrought an entire change in his life and character. The Catholic Church has a festival (May 3) in commemoration of this event. He retired into solitude, wrote there many books, and prepared himself for baptism, which he received in the thirty-third year of his age, together with his son Adeodatus, from the hands of Ambrose. He returned to Africa, sold his estate, and gave the proceeds to the poor, retaining only enough to support him in a moderate manner. As he was once present in the church at Hippo, the bishop, who was a very old man, signified a desire to consecrate a priest to assist and succeed him. At the desire of the people, Augustine entered upon the holy office, preached with extraordinary success, and, in the year 395, became bishop of Hippo. He entered into a warm controversy with Pelagius concerning the doctrines of freewill, of grace, and of predestination, and wrote a book concerning them. Augustine maintained that men were justified merely through grace, and not through good works. He died August 28th, A.D. 430, while Hippo was besieged by the Vandals.</p>
 <p>There have been Fathers of the Church more learned—masters of a better language and a purer taste; but none have ever more powerfully touched the human heart and warmed it towards religion. Painters have therefore given him for a symbol a flaming heart. Augustine is one of the most voluminous of the Christian writers. His works, in Migne's <title>Patrologia Latina</title>, fill 16 volumes (xxxii.xlvii.). The first of these contains the works which he wrote before he was a priest, and his <title>Retractationes</title> and <title>Confessiones;</title> the former a critical review of his own writings, and the latter a curious and interesting picture of his life. The remainder of these volumes consist of a treatise <title>On the City of God (De Civitate Dei)</title>; commentaries on Scripture; epistles on a great variety of subjects, doctrinal, moral, and personal; sermons and homilies; treatises on various points of discipline; and elaborate arguments against heretics. With the exception of those of Aristotle, no writings contributed more than Angustine's to encourage the spirit of subtle disputation which distinguished the scholastic ages. They exhibit much facility of invention and strength of reasoning, with more argument than eloquence and more wit than learning. Erasmus calls Augustine a writer of obscure subtlety, who requires in the reader acute penetration, close attention, and quick recollection, and by no means repays him for the application of all these requisites. It was St. Augustine who finally established the vocabulary of ecclesiastical Latinity, setting the stamp of his authority upon the new coinages that fill the pages of Tertullian.</p>

 <p> The first Roman emperor, was born on the 23d of September, B.C. 63, and was the son of C. Octavius, by Atia, a daughter of Iulia, the sister of C. Iulius Caesar. His original name was Octavius, and after his adoption by his great-uncle, C. Iulius Caesar Octavianus, Augustus being only a title given him by the Senate and the people in B.C. 27 to express their veneration for him. He was pursuing his studies at Apollonia when the news reached him of his uncle's murder at Rome, in March, 44. He forthwith set out for Italy, and upon landing was received with enthusiasm by the troops. He first joined the republican party in order to crush Antony, against whom he fought at Mutina in conjunction with the two consuls, C. Vibius Pansa and Hirtius. Antony was defeated, and obliged to retreat across the Alps; and the death of the two consuls gave Augustus the command of all their troops. He now returned to Rome, and compelled the Senate to elect him consul, and shortly afterwards he became reconciled to Antony. It was agreed that the Roman world should be divided between Augustus, Antony, and Lepidus, under the title of <seg lang="la">triumviri rei publicae constituendae</seg>, and that this arrangement should last for the next five years. They published a <seg lang="la">proscriptio</seg>, or list of all their enemies whose lives were to be sacrificed and their property confiscated; upwards of 2000 equites and 300 senators were thus put to death, among them Cicero. Soon afterwards, Augustus and Antony crossed over to Greece, and defeated Brutus and Cassius at the decisive battle of Philippi, in B.C. 42, by which the hopes of the republican party were ruined.</p>
 <p>Augustus returned to Italy, where a new war awaited him (B.C. 41), excited by Fulvia, the wife of Antony. She was supported by L. Antonius, <cb /> the consul and brother of the triumvir, who threw himself into the fortified town of Perusia, which Augustus succeeded in taking in 40. Antony now made preparations for war, but the death of Fulvia led to a reconciliation between the triumvirs, who concluded a peace at Brundusium. A new division of the provinces was again made: Augustus obtained all the parts of the Empire west of the town of Scodra in Illyricum, Antony the east provinces, and Lepidus Africa. Antony married Octavia, the sister of Augustus, in order to cement their alliance. In B.C. 36, Augustus conquered Sex. Pompey, who had held possession of Sicily for many years with a powerful fleet. Lepidus, who had landed in Sicily to support Augustus, was degraded by him, stripped of his power, and sent to Rome, where he resided for the remainder of his life, being allowed to retain the dignity of Pontifex Maximus. Meantime, Antony had repudiated Octavia, on account of his love for Cleopatra , and had alienated the minds of the Roman people by his arbitrary conduct. The Senate declared war against Cleopatra ; and in September, B.C. 31, the fleet of Augustus gained a brilliant victory over Antony's near Actium in Acarnania. In the following year (30), Augustus sailed to Egypt. Antony and Cleopatra , who had escaped in safety from Actium, put an end to their lives. Augustus now became the undisputed master of the Roman world, but he declined all honours and distinctions which were likely to remind the Romans of kingly power. On the death of Lepidus, in B.C. 12, he be<figure id="fig.00169">
<head orig="Augustus Caesar.">Augustus Caesar.</head>
</figure> came pontifex maximus. On those state matters which he did not choose to be discussed in public he consulted his personal friends, Maecenas, M. Agrippa, M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, and Asinius Pollio. The wars of Augustus were chiefly undertaken to protect the frontiers of the Roman dominions. Most of them were carried on by his relations and friends, but several he conducted in person, as when, in 27, he attacked the warlike Cantabri and Astures in Spain. In 20, he went to Syria, where he received from Phraates, the Parthian monarch, the standards and prisoners which had been taken from Crassus and Antony. He died at Nola, on the 19th of August, A.D. 14, at the age of seventy-six. His last wife was Livia, who had been previously the wife of Tiberius Nero. He had no children by Livia, and only a daughter, Iulia, by his former wife Scribonia. Iulia had married Agrippa, and her two sons, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, were destined by Augustus as his successors. On the death of these two youths, Augustus was persuaded to adopt Tiberius, the son of Livia by her former husband, and to make him his colleague and successor.

 <p>Augustus is described as having been something below the middle size, but extremely well proportioned ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 79" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>79</bibl>). His hair was inclined to curl, and of a yellowish-brown; his eyes were

 bright and lively; but the general expression of his countenance was remarkably calm and mild. His health was throughout his life delicate, yet the constant attention which he paid to it, and his strict temperance in eating and drinking, enabled him to reach the full age of man. As a seducer, adulterer, and sensualist, his character was like that of his uncle ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 69" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>69</bibl><bibl n="Suet. Aug. 71" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. Aug., 71</bibl>). In his literary qualifications, without at all rivalling the attainments of Iulius Caesar, he was on a level with most Romans of distinction of his time; and it is said that both in speaking and writing his style was eminent for its perfect plainness and propriety ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 68" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>68</bibl> foll.). His speeches on any public <figure id="fig.00170">
<head orig="Statue of Augustus. (Vatican.)">Statue of Augustus. (Vatican.)</head>
</figure> occasion were composed beforehand, and recited from memory; in fact, so careful was he not to commit himself by any inconsiderate expression, that even when discussing any important subject with his own wife, he wrote down what he had to say, and read it before her. Like his uncle, he was somewhat tinged with superstition. He was deficient in military talent; but in every species of artful policy, in clearly seeing, and steadily and dispassionately following his own interest, and in <cb /> turning to advantage all the weaknesses of others, his ability has been rarely equalled. His deliberate cruelty, his repeated treachery, and his sacrifice of every duty and every feeling to the purposes of his ambition, speak for themselves; and yet it would be unjust to ascribe to a politic premeditation all the popular actions of his reign. Good is in itself so much more delightful than evil that he was doubtless not insensible to the pleasure of kind and beneficent actions, and perhaps sincerely rejoiced that they were no longer incompatible with his interests.</p>
 <p>Among the various arts to which Augustus resorted to gain the good-will of his people, and perhaps to render them forgetful of their former freedom, one of the most remarkable was the encouragement which he extended to learning, and the patronage which he so liberally bestowed on all by whom it was cultivated. To this noble protection of literature he was prompted not less by taste and inclination than by sound policy; and in his patronage of the learned, his usual artifice had probably a smaller share than in those other parts of his conduct by which he acquired the favourable opinion of the world. Augustus was, in fact, himself an excellent judge of composition, and a true critic in poetry; so that his patronage was never misplaced, or lavished on those whose writings might have tended to corrupt the taste and learning of the age. The court of Augustus thus became a school of culture, where men of genius acquired that delicacy of taste, elevation of sentiment, and purity of expression which characterize the writers of the age. To Maecenas, the favourite minister of the emperor, the honour is due of having most successfully followed out the views of Augustus for promoting the interests of literature; but it is wrong to give Maecenas the credit, as some have done, of first having turned the attention of Augustus to the patronage of literature. On the contrary, he appears largely to have acted from the orders, or to have followed the example, of his imperial master.</p>
 <p>Augustus was buried in a mausoleum, whose remains are still to be seen at Rome on the Via de' Pontefici. It was a pyramidal tower, 328 feet in height, covered with white marble, surmounted by a statue of the emperor, and divided into three stories by receding steps, each story being planted with cypress-trees. Before this structure was set the tablet of bronze containing the <seg lang="la">index rerum a se gestarum</seg>, which he had had prepared ( <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 101" default="NO" valid="yes">Suet. <title>Aug.</title>101</bibl>). A copy of this important inscription was found in modern times on the inside of the <seg lang="la">antae</seg> of a temple at Ancyra (now Angora), in Galatia, and has been published in fac-simile by Prof. Mommsen, with a commentary. It is reproduced in the illustration on page 171.</p>

 <p> (1) <hi rend="SmallCaps">Lucius Domitius</hi>. A Roman emperor (A.D. 270-275), distinguished for his military abilities and severity of character, was the son of a peasant, born about A.D. 212 in the territory of Sirmium in Illyria. His father occupied a small farm, the property of Aurelius, a rich senator. The son enlisted in the troops as a common soldier, successively rose to the rank of centurion, tribune, prefect of a legion, inspector of the camp, general, or, as it was then called, duke of a frontier; and at length, during the Gothic War, exercised the important office of commanderin-chief of the cavalry. In every station he distinguished himself by matchless valour, rigid discipline, and successful leadership. Theoclius affirms that in one day he killed forty-eight Sarmatians, and in several subsequent engagements nine hundred and fifty. This heroic valour was admired by the soldiers, and celebrated in their rude songs, the burden of which was “<title>Mille, mille, mille, mille, mille, mille, occidit.</title>” At length Valerian II. raised him to the consulship, and his good fortune was further favoured by a wealthy and noble marriage. His next elevation was to the throne, Claudius II., on his death-bed, having recommended Aurelian to the troops of Illyricum. The reign of this monarch lasted only four years and about nine months; but every instant of that short period was filled by some memorable achievement. He put an end to the Gothic War, chastised the Germans who invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Spain, and Britain out of the hands of Tetricus, and destroyed the proud monarchy which <ref type="cross" target="crosszenobia">Zenobia</ref> (q.v.) had erected in the East on the ruins of the afflicted Empire. Owing to the ungenerous excuse of the queen that she had waged war by the advice of her ministers, her secretary, the celebrated <ref type="cross" target="crosslonginus">Longinus</ref> (q.v.), was put to death by the victor; but, after having graced <cb /> his triumphal entry into Rome, Zenobia herself was presented with a villa near Tibur, and allowed to spend the remainder of her days as a Roman matron.</p>
 <p>On his return to Rome, he surrounded the city with a new line of walls. He abandoned Dacia, which had been first conquered by Trajan, and made the southern bank of the Danube, as in the time of Augustus, the boundary of the Empire. He was killed by some of his officers while preparing to march against the Persians.</p>
 <p>(2) <ref type="cross" target="crosscaelius">Caelius</ref>. A physician, a native of Numidia, who lived about the fourth or fifth century A.D. He left two books, one entitled, <title>Libri Quinque Tardarum sive Chronicarum Passionum</title>, and the other, <title>Libri Tres Celerum sive Acutarum Passionum.</title> Both are drawn from Greek authors,—from Themison, Thessalus, and, above all, Soranus. His work is particularly valuable, as preserving to us an account of many theories and views of practice which would otherwise have been lost; but even of itself it is deserving of much attention for the practical information which it contains. Caelius is remarkable for learning, understanding, and scrupulous accuracy; but his style is much loaded with technical terms, and by no means elegant. He has treated of the most important diseases which come under the care of a physician. He also wrote a compendium of the whole science of medicine in the form of a catechism (<title>Medicinales Responsiones</title>), of which considerable fragments remain. So far as known there are now no MSS. of Caelius Aurelianus in existence, the Lorsch codex used by Sichard in his <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> of the <bibl default="NO"><title>Tardae Passiones</title> (Basle, 1529)</bibl> having since that time been lost.

 <p> (<foreign lang="greek">χρυσός</foreign>). Gold, from its malleability and the circumstance that it is found lying in lumps, was one of the earliest of metals used by man, and among the most primitive resources of civilization. This was suspected by the ancients, who make the earliest age of the world's history an age of gold. In the Heroic Age we find that gold was put to a great variety of uses. Homer speaks of the houses of Menelaüs and Alcinoüs as full of silver and gold; the armour of Glaucus was of gold ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 6. 236" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>vi. 236</bibl>), so were the handmaids of Hephaestus ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18. 417" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xviii. 417</bibl>), and the doves on Nestor 's cup ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11. 632" default="NO" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>xi. 632</bibl>). So in the decoration of the shield of Achilles, the chest of Cypselus, and other works of art, much gold was employed. And that this plenty of gold was not a mere figment of the poet we know from the best testimony, that of graves. At Mycenae, which is in Homer called <foreign lang="greek">πολύχρυσος</foreign>, Dr. Schliemann has dug up a prodigious quantity of gold,—cups, and jugs, and masks, and ornaments of all sorts. The graves of the Crimea (though these are of later date) also yield abundance of gold, the corpses which are discovered in them being covered from head to foot with gold, beaten into the shape of animals, rosettes, and designs of all kinds. In the use of gold the wealthy Ionians of Asia Minor copied their neighbours, even binding their hair with it, in which custom the Athenians are said to have followed them ( <bibl n="Thuc.  1. 6" default="NO" valid="yes">Thuc.i. 6</bibl>). See <ref type="cross" target="crosscaelatura">Caelatura</ref>.</p>
 <p>There can be no question that to the smiths of early time gold must have been the metal which gave most scope for the artistic faculty. Its extreme softness and malleability enabled even workmen who had no more elaborate tools than a hammer and nails to work it into any given shape. All the vessels of Mycenae are thus hammered out and joined into shape by nails, and the earliest statues of the gods were produced by the same method, which was called by the ancients <foreign lang="greek">σφυρηλατεῖν</foreign>. They did indeed sometimes, instead of welding two surfaces of gold together, unite them by a solder of borax (Schliemann's <title>Mycenae.</title> p. 231), but practically this process was unusual. Casting in hollow moulds belongs to a later period.</p>
 <p>In the preparation of gold the ancients used only the simplest processes of melting and refining. When gold occurred mixed with silver they frequently did not separate the silver, but treated the mixed as a simple metal.</p>
 <p>Asia was the source of gold, from the days when the Argonauts sailed to Colchis in search of the golden fleece, to the days when Alexander and his captains seized and dispersed the enormous hoards laid up during many generations by the Babylonian kings and their Persian successors. Arrian and Diodorus give us accounts which might well seem fabulous of the quantities of gold seized in <cb /> the great cities of Asia. According to Diodorus (xvii. 71), in the city of Persepolis alone Alexander captured a treasure in gold and silver of 120,000 talents. The wealth in gold of Croesus is testified by his gift to Delphi ( <bibl n="Hdt.  1. 50" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.i. 50</bibl>) of above 100 solid bricks of the metal. A private individual, Pythius, in the reign of Xerxes, possessed three millions of gold darics ( <bibl n="Hdt.  7. 27" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.vii. 27</bibl>). The sources whence the gold of Asia was drawn were various—India was one of the chief. In Arabia, also, abundant gold was found and freely exported (Strabo, xvi. 3, 4). Lydia supplied great quantities of river-gold, both pure and mixed with silver. (See <ref type="cross" target="crosselectrum">Electrum</ref>.) But the richest source of all, in the opinion of the ancients, was the country of the <ref type="cross" target="crossarimaspi">Arimaspi</ref> (q.v.), where the gold was guarded by griffins, and with difficulty won from them by the hardy natives. Most modern writers suppose that the reality which gave rise to this fable was the gold mines of the Caucasus, whence gold penetrated through the country of the Scythians to Persia. A similar story was told or invented in regard to the Indian gold ( <bibl n="Hdt.  3. 102" default="NO" valid="yes">Herod.iii. 102</bibl>) —namely, that it was found in a country infested by huge ants (<foreign lang="greek">μύρμηκες</foreign>), from whose pursuit men could only escape when riding on swift camels. The motive of these stories for deterring adventurers is very manifest.</p>
 <p>The gold mines of Europe were also important. The Carthaginians, and after them the Romans, obtained their main supply from Spain, in the rivers of which country was a rich deposit of gold, notably in the Tagus. Both in Gaul and in Spain, at the time of the Roman conquests, whole districts were covered with rich auriferous deposits, yielding nuggets to the inhabitants on the application of the simplest systems of washing. In the provinces of Asturia and Lusitania, according to Pliny ( <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33. 78" default="NO" valid="yes">Pliny <title>H. N.</title>xxxiii. 78</bibl>), the workmen went through the laborious process of undermining whole hills by their excavations, and then turning on rivers to wash the fallen earth and separate the particles of metal. Gold was also found in the Italian Padus, in the Hebrus in Thrace, and other rivers. Polybius states (xxxiv. 10) that in his time great quantities of gold were found on the surface of the ground in Pannonia. In Greece proper, gold was found in small quantities in the islands of Siphnos and Thasos, and in larger quantities in the mountains of Thrace. These last, however, seem not to have yielded their full supply until they fell into the hands of Philip of Macedon, who procured from them, it is said, 1000 talents a year ( <bibl n="Diod.  16. 8" default="NO" valid="yes">Diod.xvi. 8</bibl>).</p>
 <p>Diodorus also informs us (iii. 12) that in Upper Egypt, on the confines of Aethiopia, were gold mines which were worked, from the time of the early kings of Egypt onwards, for the benefit of the state. But here the gold was not found as elsewhere, on the surface of the ground, but extracted from the heart of the mountains by a number of miserable slaves. Diodorus describes the process, which appears to be that of extracting gold from quartz. The stone, he says, which contained the metal was softened by fire, and then detached in masses by wedges of iron. These masses were brayed in stone mortars and ground to the fineness of sand. Finally, the gold was detached by washing, the workmen aiding the process with their hands and with fine sponges. The metal was purified by being placed, together with a certain quantity of lead, salt, tin, and bran, in jars hermetically sealed, and exposed for five days to the heat 
<pb n="174" /><cb />
 of a fire, after which time the foreign substances were found to have evaporated.</p>
 <p>In his thirty-third book the elder Pliny traces the history of the use of gold in Rome from earliest times. He says (chap. v.) that when the Gauls sacked the city no more than 1000 pounds' weight of gold could be found in it for ransom. The stock of gold in the treasury had increased seven years before the Third Punic War to 17,410 pounds; and after the successful termination of that war the metal came into commoner use for decoration, as for covering ceilings and walls, as well as for vessels. The custom of wearing gold rings was so late in Rome that even Marius wore one of iron. (See <ref type="cross" target="crossanulus">Anulus</ref>.) The great influx of the metal and its use for all purposes of luxury dated in Rome as in Greece from the time of Oriental conquest. For ancient testimonies as to gold mines, see Sabatier, <title>Production de l'Or, de l'Argent, et du Cuivre chez les Anciens;</title> and for the use of gold in coinage, see <ref type="cross" target="crossnumismatics">Numismatics</ref>.

<head orig="Aurum Coronarium">Aurum Coronarium</head>

 <p> When a general in a Roman province had obtained a victory, it was the custom for the cities in his own provinces, and for those from the neighbouring states, to send golden crowns to him, which were carried before him in his triumph at Rome. In the time of Cicero it appears to have been usual for the cities of the provinces, instead of sending crowns on occasion of a victory, to pay money, which was called <seg lang="la">aurum coronarium.</seg> This offering, which was at first voluntary, came to be regarded as a regular tribute, and seems to have been sometimes exacted by the governors of the provinces even when no victory had been gained. By a law of Iulius Caesar, it was provided that the aurum coronarium should not be given unless a triumph was decreed; but under the emperors it was exacted on many other occasions, as, for instance, on the adoption of Antoninus Pius. It continued to be collected, apparently as a part of the revenue, in the time of Valentinian I. and Theodosius.

<div2 id="crossausonius" type="entry" org="uniform" sample="complete">
 <head><surname full="yes">Ausonius</surname></head>, <foreName full="yes">Decīmus </foreName>
 <p>Magnus . The most remarkable Latin poet of the fourth century <hi rend="SmallCaps">a.d.;</hi> born about 310 at Burdigala (Bordeaux). He was son of the private physician of Valentinian I. and afterwards prefect of Illyria. Educated thoroughly in grammar, rhetoric, and law, he practised as an advocate in his native city, where he afterwards became professor of grammar and rhetoric. He was then invited by Valentinian to undertake the education of his son Gratian, who, after he had ascended the throne, conferred upon him the consulship and other distinctions. After the assassination of Gratian he retired to his estate near Burdigala, where he continued to reside, in full literary activity, till 390. He became a Christian, <cb /> probably on accepting the office of tutor to the prince. Besides composing a turgid address of thanks to Gratian, delivered at Trèves, Ausonius wrote a series of poems, including verses in memory of deceased relatives (<title>Parentalia</title>), verses commemorating his colleagues <title>(Commemoratio Professorum Burdigalensium), Epitaphia, Eclogae, Epistulae, Epigrammata</title>, and a number of miscellaneous pieces, one of which (<title>Mosella</title>) is the narrative of a tour from Bingen on the Rhine to Berncastel (Tabernae) on the Moselle, and then up the Moselle past Neumagen (Noviomagum) to Trèves. Its subject has secured the poem some renown.</p>
 <p>Ausonius is not a real poet, but he tries to make up for lack of genius by dexterity in metre, by the manipulation of words, and by ornaments of learning and rhetoric. The consequence is that his style is generally neither simple nor natural.</p>
 <p>The <seg lang="la">editio princeps</seg> of Ausonius was published in Venice (1472 foll.). There are separate editions of the <title>Mosella</title> by Böcking, with notes <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1828)</bibl>; a variorum <bibl default="NO">(Bonn, 1842)</bibl>, this with a German translation; and by Schenkl <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1883)</bibl>. There is an English translation by C. T. Brooks, in Waring's <bibl default="NO"><title>Bride of the Rhine</title> (Boston, 1878)</bibl>. The other poems may be found in the editions by Schenkl <bibl default="NO">(Berlin, 1883)</bibl> and Peiper <bibl default="NO">(Leipzig, 1886)</bibl>.

<note id="ref1" target="n1">* The original name for these abbreviations seems to have been litterae singulares or singulariae (cf.  Gell.xvii.9.1). At a later period notae became the more common term (cf. Festus, p. 184: Nota nunc significat signum at in pecoribus, tabulis, libris, litterae singulae vel binae). Valerius Probus wrote an elaborate work De Notis, only a part of which has been preserved. In the Digests of Justinian nota is displaced by the term sigla. The word is of doubtful origin. Most scholars regard it as a syncopated form of sigillum; others derive it from singuli; Mommsen thinks it a mere corruption from singulares.</note>
