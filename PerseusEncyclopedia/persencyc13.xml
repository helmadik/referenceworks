                <subhead>Physical Description</subhead>
                <p>Macedonia is part of a large region which received its name in Classical times. In antiquity Macedonia proper consisted of the coastal plain of the Thermaic Gulf, which has been formed by the rivers Axius, Lydias, and Haliacmon. The modern Greek province, much reduced since antiquity, is in the shape of the capital letter L lying on its side. The short arm extends south to <placeName>Mount Olympos</placeName>(2917 m) on the Thessalian border with Thrace. Geographically Macedonia forms the connecting link between the Balkans and the Greek Peninsula. The frontiers of northern Macedonia with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are formed by high mountain ranges, and its extensive plateaus are divided by lower ranges which drain into the lakes or one of rivers of the region, the Axius, the Lydias or the Haliacmon. All of these rivers flow through Macedonia to the Aegean Sea.</p>
                <p>The climate of Macedonia is continental, marked by cold winters with bitter north winds, and hot summers. Both in climate and terrain Macedonia resembles the Eastern Europe more than the Greek peninsula. Rich in timber, cattle, sheep, horses, cereals and vines, Macedonia has always been able to support a larger population than any other region in Greece. In climate, the Chalcidice peninsula has a Mediterranean climate and produces olives, fruits, and timber suitable for ship-construction.</p>
                <p>Chalcidice, with all its promontories, has the best harbors, but the principal harbor has been at Thessaloniki since antiquity. Three important routes converge on the Macedonian plain: from the Danube via the Morava and Axius valleys; from the Adriatic via Lake Ochrida; and from Thrace via Mygdonia. Contact with points south is made through the narrow vale of Tempe into Thessaly.</p>

                <subhead>History</subhead>
                <p>Occupied continuously since early Neolithic times, Macedonia possessed a distinctive culture in the Bronze Age, which was affected by Mycenaean civilization. After c. 1150 B.C. Macedonia entered a dark age. The nucleus of the Classical Macedonians was perhaps formed by the peoples called Macedoni who came from southwestern Macedonia. The tribes of upper Macedonia, however, were most likely composed of Greek, Illyrian and Thracian people who began moving into the region in the centuries following the Dorian invasion. Until the fourth century B.C. when Philip II incorporated Northern Macedonia, and annexed the Strymon valley and Chalcidice, Macedonia was divided and there was a constant struggle between the semi-independent principalities. After Philip's unification, Macedonia became a state with great economic and military strength ruled by Phillip's son, Alexander the Great, and a succession of monarchs until the Roman conquest.</p>

                <subhead>Sites</subhead>
                <p>Kavalla, located just west of Thrace and north of the island of Thasos, is the principal port of eastern Macedonia. The town boasts a spacious harbor which sits on the slopes of <placeName>Mount Mandra Kari</placeName>. Upon a rocky citadel jutting into the sea was the acropolis. Sixth century settlers from the island of Paros founded Kavalla and named it Neapolis. It rose to prosperity after discovery of gold in the nearby Panagaion hills and on the Island of Thasos. In antiquity Kavalla was the principal port of Philippi, a town lying 15 km to the northwest.</p>
                <p>Philippi was settled by people from Thasos who came to mine the gold in the Panagaion hills. They called it Krenides because of the springs in the area. In 361 B.C. new settlers established themselves in Krenides, and five years later, Philip II took the town and named it after himself. Philippi is best known as the location of the battle in which, in 42 B.C., Octavian defeated Brutus. Built into the hillside of the town is a fourth century B.C. theater, later altered by the Romans. The acropolis, now adorned with remains from Macedonian, Roman and Byzantine times, sat on a hill above the town.</p>
                <p>Continuing to the west, near the mouth of the river Strymon, lies the town of Amphipolis. Amphipolis was a major Greek stronghold and in Roman times an important station on the Via Egnatia, the main road from Byzantium to the Adriatic. The most striking monument of the town is a stone lion which stands just outside of Amphipolis west of the Strymon. Originally the lion may have honored Laomedon, a sailor from Lesbos who later became governor of Syria.</p>
                <p>Just 6 km off the coast of Kavalla sits Thasos, the most northerly of the Aegean islands. The island is almost circular in shape with an area of 379 sq. km. Being of volcanic origin, Thasos is fertile and hilly, its highest point being <placeName>Mount Hysaprion</placeName> at 1135 m in the center of the island. The mountainsides are covered with a variety of trees: pine, plane, and chestnut, which have always been in demand for ship building. The island has been important since the Phoenicians first occupied the island and mined the minerals, particularly gold. The harbor city of Thasos has an agora dating from the time of the original Greek settlement with Hellenistic additions and embellishments. Within the agora there are three stoas, a precinct of Zeus Agoraios, and several altars around which were arranged statues. Opening off the harbor are the Chariot gate and the gate of Hermes in the circuit of the fifth century B.C. wall. In the walls along the southwest side of the town are the gate of Zeus, the gate of Herakles, and the gate of Silenos (all named after reliefs found on the uprights of each gate). Within the walls are Sanctuaries to both Poseidon and Dionysos and a fourth century B.C. theater.</p>
                <p>Between 710 and 680 B.C. Thasos was occupied by settlers from the island of Paros, and it was here that the Archaic Parian poet Archilochos wrote his verse. Despite the protection of the solid walls of the city of Thasos, the islanders surrendered to the Persians in the fifth century B.C. The island was seized by Philip II in the fourth century B.C. and remained Macedonian until the Romans arrived in 196 B.C.</p>
                <p>Thessaloniki is the only important city of western Macedonia today. It rises on a protected bay on the Thermaic Gulf on the slopes of <placeName>Mount Khortiatis</placeName>1201 m, and has developed into an important port and center of communication between between Greece and the Balkan states. The town was founded by Kassandros in c. 315 B.C. near the settlement of Thermai and named after his wife Thessalonike, sister to Alexander the Great. During the Middle Ages it was the second city of the Byzantine Empire.</p>
                <p>Vergina is a village 75 km southwest of Thessaloniki on the southern edge of the Haliacmon plain, and is known for both the palace of Palatitsa and for the tomb of Vergina, dated to the Hellenistic period. Vergina is thought to be the ancient Macedonian capital of Aigai. The so-called palace of Palatitsa sits on a low hill marked by a large oak tree and dates to the reign of Antigonus Gonatas (c. 320-239 B.C.). Although the palace was destroyed by fire, it is clear that a triple propylaia leads through the east wing to a central peristyle of pilasters with 16 by 16 double engaged columns. Between the palace and the village of Palatitsa extends a large tumulus cemetery from the Early Iron Age (tenth to the seventh centuries B.C.). In the vicinity of this cemetery is the tomb of Vergina, a Macedonian temple tomb of the 4th century B.C. with an Ionic facade closed by two pairs of marble doors. Discovered in 1977 by Manolis Andronikos, this tomb with its splendid paintings, golden treasure, and cremated remains of an old warrior, is thought to be the burial of the Great Phillip, Alexander's father.</p>
                <p>Northwest of Thessaloniki is the city of Pella, thought by some archaeologists to be an ancient capital of the Macedonians. It has been excavated since 1957 by Greek archaeologists. The site is noted for blocks of well-built houses of the 4th century B.C. and earlier, many with mosaic floors of outstanding artistic quality.</p>

                <subhead>Physical Description</subhead>
                <p>Magnesia is a region in central Greece at the head of the Pagasitikos gulf, a splendid natural harbor that serves as the entrance to Thessaly. The shape of the district is that of a large crescent with its western point among the rolling hills of the mainland on the west, and in the east its other point is the splendid <placeName>Mount Pelion</placeName> that extends south into the Aegean sea towards the northern Sporades islands, then curves back to the east in a great crab clay that attempts to close the mouth of the Pagasitikos gulf. The modern town of Volos, the largest in central Greece, sits on a small plain midway along the crescent in the north at the top end of the gulf. The ancient sites of Magnesia cluster around Volos and its pocket plain and include the Neolithic towns of Sesklo and Dimini, the Bronze Age towns of Pefkakia and Iolkos, and the Classical cities of Phthiotic Thebes, Demetrias, and Pagasai.</p>

              <div4 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete">
                <subhead>History</subhead>
                <p>Magnesia, as the natural point of entry to the fertile plains of Thessaly, was settled by Neolithic immigrants early in the 7th millennium B.C., and a typical village of this period is found at Sesklo some 19 km west of Volos on the road to Larissa. The Thessalian Neolithic lasted 4000 years, and more than 350 artificial mounds (called tells) are scattered today across the plain. These tells were formed by the successive construction and destruction of farming villages on the same site, and the debris from the ruined houses of adobe brick helped raise the summit of the mounds above the level of the flood-prone plain. Dimini is another of these Neolithic villages, and like Sesklo it is near to Volos. Recent study of the geology of the district has shown that the coastline has been moving seawards over the last 8000 years as new alluvium has washed down from the mountain slopes, building the plain outwards at the coast. The villages were shifted periodically to keep them close to the moving coastline.</p>
                <p>In the 3rd millennium B.C., at the beginning of the Bronze Age, the center of population and the development of advanced civilization shifted to the Peloponnese, the Cycladic islands, and Crete in southern Greece. Thessaly had its own flourishing Bronze Age civilization at this time, but little is known about the history of this period. In Mycenaean times a major city known as Iolkos was the political center of the region. Greek archaeologists excavated the remains of a Mycenaean tell in the heart of modern Volos in the 1950's that are believed to be those of Iolkos. Jason and the Argonauts began their voyage according to tradition at Iolkos.</p>
                <p>The greatest prosperity and importance for Magnesia in Classical Antiquity was in the Hellenistic period, when the Macedonian kings who succeeded Alexander as rulers of Greece moved the principal city from Pagasai to the newly-built city of Demetrias. The latter became an important town in the 3rd-2nd centuries B.C., primarily as the exporter of Thessalian grain and war horses. The Macedonian kings used Demetrias as a port and regional capital during the wars with Rome, and after their defeat Demetrias became a Roman provincial town of no great significance.</p>
                <p>Magnesia and Thessaly were part of the Byzantine Empire until the Turks occupied them in the 15th century A.D., and they were only united with the modern Greek state after the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913. Partisans from the picturesque, and nearly impregnable, villages that cling to the high slopes of <placeName>Mount Pelion</placeName> above Volos played a heroic and still-remembered role in resisting Turkish dominion.</p>

              <div4 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete">
                <subhead>Sites</subhead>
                <p>Demetrias and Pagasai-The successive Classical and Hellenistic cities of Magnesia are found together at the southwest edge of the present city of Volos. There is little preserved at the surface. What is known about the sites has come from Greek and German excavations carried out intermittently during this century. The fortification walls, mostly belonging to the Hellenistic period, are the only conspicuous feature. It is from these walls that archaeologists have pulled a number of beautiful Classical painted grave stelae that were used as construction material in antiquity.</p>
                <p>Dimini-The site is perched on a rock at the northwest edge of the city of Volos. The site is confined to the summit of the rock, and was first cleared by Greek archaeologists in 1899, and subsequently explored in the 1970's by a team from the Volos archaeological museum. Foundations of concentric stone walls, with an inner courtyard, and a central megaron-style building were once part of a Neolithic and Early Bronze Age citadel complex. The lower town has not been explored. At the edge of the site is a fine small Mycenaean tholos tomb, possibly belonging to an important person from nearby Iolkos.</p>
                <p>Iolkos-Remains of two Mycenaean buildings, perhaps palaces, were found in excavations by Greek archaeologists in the 1950's in a tell in a suburb of Volos, about 2 km southeast of Dimini. These remains, the tholos tomb at Dimini, and other chance finds from the vicinity, have convinced many archaeologists that this is site is Mycenaean Iolkos. There is nothing to be seen at the site at present.</p>
                <p>Pefkakia-This small tell is found at the southwest edge of the Volos, and it was an important town in the Early Bronze Age. A succession of villages and towns, moving from Dimini, to Pefkakia, Iolkos, Pagasai, and Demetrias, were following the retreating coastline. Pefkakia was excavated briefly by German archaeologists in the 1970's, and some ruined walls are visible in a section at the site.</p>
                <p>Phthiotic Thebes-The Classical city of Phthiotic Thebes is located 20 km southwest of Volos, and it was the center of the mainland arm of Magnesia. The most conspicuous feature are the extensive Classical fortifications with 40 standing towers. There are also remains of a stone temple of Athena, a theater, and a stoa. The city was moved a few kilometers to the coast in the Late Roman period, and Greek archaeologists have uncovered a fascinating string of 5 Early Christian basilica churches with beautiful stone columns along the beach. In addition to the churches there are many fine mosaics, roads, public buildings, and houses tobe seen.</p>
                <p>Sesklo-This site is some 19 km northwest of Volos off the road to Larissa. This is one of the important Neolithic sites of Thessaly. Excavated by Greek archaeologists in 1900 and the 1960's and 1970's there are many interesting remains to be seen. First settled at the beginning of the Neolithic period c. 6800 B.C., the site was continuously occupied until the Early Bronze Age. A small acropolis has a Middle Neolithic (c. 5500 B.C.) megaron on its summit, and around it are many foundations of houses and other buildings, many showing clear traces of the fire that destroyed them. A stone fortification wall was built around the Neolithic acropolis after 4000 B.C., a time when the town reached its greatest size. Neolithic houses, possibly part of an extensive lower town, can be seen in the fields by the car park, about 100 m from the acropolis.</p>

              <p>With regard to vase painting, Beazley writes: "I am conscious that the vases placed under the heading 'manner of' an artist are not always in the same category: the list may include (1) vases which are like the painter's work, but can safely be said not to be from his hand, (2) vases which are like the painter's work, but about which I do not know enough to say that they are not from his hand, (3) vases which are like the painter's work, but of which, although I know them well, I cannot say whether they are from his hand or not." (ABV, p. x) Although this term is used in slightly different ways by Beazley, it is clear that he uses it when he is certain that the work of one artist dominates a particular period. As suggested by Robertson, it seems to be oftentimes used to describe the work of painters who were influenced by a central, highly productive artist of the time.</p>

                <subhead>Physical Description</subhead>
                <p>Directly to the west of Attica is the small territory of Megara. Megara links mainland Greece with the Peloponnese.</p>
                <p>The Megarid is situated in a fertile but narrow plain, .6 km from the Aegean sea. It lies between between Mts. Geranea, Kithairon, and Cerata which separated it from Corinthia to the south, Boeotia to the north, and Attica to the east and northeast. The small coastal plain below the city of Megara is very fertile and today is covered with more than a million olive trees.</p>
                <p>Communications with the Corinthian gulf are difficult due to the hilly terrain, but the region of Megara has good harbors on the Saronic gulf which enables the region to trade easily with the east. Its major seaport on the Saronic gulf was Nisaea, which was connected to the city of Megara by two long walls.</p>

                <subhead>History</subhead>
                <p>Directly east of the Megarid about .3 km is the island of Salamis, which in antiquity was administered by Megara. Unlike the Athenians, the Megarians spoke Doric Greek, and they were often politically aligned with their Dorian kinsmen in the Peloponnese. During the Dorian invasions of the twelfth century B.C. all the territories around Megarid were falling prey to the conquerors, until finally, Megarid was settled by Dorians who came from Corinthia, Messenia and other Dorian areas of the Peloponnese.</p>
                <p>In the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. Megara was powerful enough to send out colonies, but later it was dominated by its wealthy neighbor, Corinth. In the fifth century B.C., after Athens had become a leading city, Athens and Corinth vied for control of Megara because of its strategic location on the routes to Attica, Boeotia, and the Peloponnese.</p>

                <p>The city of Megara sits astride two low hills, Karia (268 m) to the east, and Alkathoos (285 m) to the west. These twin acropolises of the ancient city were connected by a long, narrow street. The main citadel was called Alkathoe after its reputed founder, Alkathous, son of <persName><surname full="yes">Pelops</surname></persName>. Megara was the birthplace of Theognis (c. 570-485 B.C.) the elegaic poet.</p>
                <p>Aigosthena is situated on the southern slopes of the Kithairon range at the northeast corner of the gulf of Corinth. Although Aigosthena was not very important historically, its fortifications, which are dated to the fourth century B.C., are among the most impressive in Greece. The acropolis is surrounded by a double wall with towers of regular ashlar masonry at intervals of 48 m. A defensive wall runs down from the northwest corner of the town to the sea. The walls enclosed a rectangular area about 545 m by 182 m.</p>

              <p>A cup whose bowl has no offset lip, but is shaped like a segment of a sphere. The foot is much taller and more slender than that on the Siana cup.</p>
              <p>History: The Merrythought cup is contemporary with the far more popular Siana cup. The senior Siana cup artist, the C Painter also decorates the Merrythought cups, which are the first of the Athenian cups without an offset lip.</p>
              <p>Term: The Merrythought cup is so called in modern times from the form of the handles, which recall a "merrythought" (British English for "wishbone").</p>

                <subhead>Physical Description</subhead>
                <p>Messenia comprises the southwestern region of the Peloponnese. It was one of six ancient counties of the Peloponnese and is one of seven modern nomes. On the north it is bounded by Elis, along the lower course of the river Neda, and also by Arcadia; on the south and west by the Ionian Sea; and on the east by Laconia, where the frontier follows the main ridge of Taygetus, but turns to the west and terminates at the river Choerius just a few kilometers south of the head of the Messenian Gulf. To the west Messenia is a bleak, mountainous region dominated by <placeName>Mount Aegaleos</placeName>, with its few settlements along the coast: Cyparissia, Coryphasion-Pylos, Methone, Asine, and Corone. The central and eastern regions were more populous and were watered by the river Pamisus and its tributaries. The lower plain, known in antiquity as Makaria, was famous for its fertility.</p>
                <p>Since Messenia combines a high rainfall with a southerly latitude, the region is rich in vines, olives, figs, and pasture land, while the alluvial plains of the west coast and of the Pamisus valley grow fine cereals.</p>
                <p>Its overland communications are difficult, and the value of its southern port for trade is impaired by the stormy conditions of the promontories which enclose the Messenian Gulf. Pylos on the west coast does possess a well protected harbor with sandy beaches which has always been an important station in the circumnavigation of the Peloponnese.</p>

                <subhead>History</subhead>
                <p>The earlier prehistory of Messenia is represented by a settlement at Malthi made up of irregular house-blocks and winding lanes. This settlement dates from the Neolithic era, but was heavily fortified in the the Middle Helladic period. In the Homeric age Messenia belonged to one of the princes of Pylos (the most famous being Nestor). The Dorians conquered Messenia and as a result Doric was the dialect of the region in Classical times. The name Pylos is strongly associated with the Mycenaean culture and especially with the Homeric Nestor who ruled the kingdom and whose palace was probably situated just north of the town. In the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. a Dorian settlement named Pylos was established on <placeName>Mount Koryfaision</placeName> at the north end of the Navarino Bay. Presently Pylos is on the western coast of Messenia south of the Mycenaean kingdom of the same name. In 425 B.C., during the Peloponnesian war, the town was occupied by the Athenians. Near the north end are traces of a ruined cyclopaean wall, but little additional evidence of Mycenaean habitation. In the summer of 425 B.C., a group of 420 occupying Spartans held out on the island of Sphakteria against an Athenian force under Demosthenes and Kleon. 292 survivors finally surrendered. The island of Sphakteria is a rocky uninhabited island 4.6 km long, with an elevation of 135 m which sits in the middle of Navarino Bay and provides the only large natural harbor on the west coast of the Peloponnese. Near the north end are traces of a ruined cyclopaean wall, but little additional evidence of Mycenaean habitation. Sphakteria was long famous as a stomping ground for pirates.</p>

                <subhead>Sites</subhead>
                <p>Excavations by Carl Blegen at Pylos revealed a Mycenaean palace with archives of clay tablets inscribed in Mycenaean Greek. These tablets revealed the detailed workings of the kingdom centered upon Pylos and its king. In the 1950's and 1960's a team from the University of Minnesota, led by William McDonald, explored the kingdom of Pylos by surface survey, revealing a long history of prehistoric and later settlement.</p>
                <p>Mycenaean Pylos is located at Ano Englianos, north of the bay of Navarino. Blegen's excavations in the 1950's uncovered a large palace complex with archives, wine cellars, craftsmen's workshops, and domestic quarters. The unwalled palace and associated cemeteries with Tholos tombs were constructed in the middle of the second millennium and were violently destroyed by fire c. 1200 B.C.</p>
                <p>Messene was founded in 396 B.C. to be the capital of Messenia. It was built in a hollow between three hills, with Eva to the southeast, Psoriari to the west and Ithome to the north, the acropolis being on Ithome. Within the walls of the city were built a theater, a synedrion, a temple of Artemis Orthia, a stadium, and an agora. All are excellent examples of fourth century military architecture.</p>
                <p>Methone, on the other hand, is a small, medieval village in a sandy bay 12 km south of Pylos. The city was held for a brief period after the Fourth Crusade by the Villehardouins, who ceded to Venice. The Venetians developed the city into a stronghold and naval station en route from the Adriatic to Crete. Currently, the Venetian fortress dominates the hill.</p>

              <p>(c. 550-489 B.C.) Miltiades, noted general and victor of the Battle of Marathon (490), was the son of <persName><surname full="yes">Cimon</surname><genName full="yes">I.</genName></persName>He was a member of Athens' rich and powerful Philaidai family. The family acquired interests in the Chersonese when the elder Miltiades, a second cousin of Miltiades Kimonos was invited there by the Dolonci to fortify a settlement for their protection. Miltiades' son, Cimon II, was an Athenian statesman and general of the first half of the fifth century.</p>
              <div4 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete">
                <subhead>Biography</subhead>
                <p>Although Miltiades' father had been murdered by Hippias and Hipparchus, sons of <persName><surname full="yes">Pisistratus</surname></persName>(<bibl n="Hdt. 6.103" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.103</bibl>), he was treated well by Hippias, who gave him his daughter in marriage. Hippias then sent Miltiades from Athens c. 524 to the Chersonese to take possession of the family's inheritance, left vacant upon the death of his brother, the younger Stesagoras. There, while continuing a policy of Athenian hegemony, Miltiades acted as virtual tyrant, arresting all of the leading men in the town upon his arrival and hiring a bodyguard of mercenary forces (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.39" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.39</bibl>).</p>
                <p>In c. 516 King Darius of Persia invaded Scythia, taking with him several Greeks, including Miltiades. At the river Danube, Darius left the Greeks to guard the bridge which they had constructed for sixty days, and he led the Persian army into Scythia (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.97.2-98.3" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.97.2-98.3</bibl>). The King decided to return, since the expedition did not produce a major engagement. The Scythians pursued him by an alternate route and reached the Danube first. By this time the sixty days had passed, and the Scythians asked the Ionians to break up the bridge. Miltiades is said to have argued for the destruction of the bridge, but the Greeks were won over by Histiaeus of Miletus, and the bridge was left intact (<bibl n="Hdt. 4.136.2-138.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 4.136.2-138.2</bibl>), thus allowing Darius to return safely to Persia. A problem with the Herodotean account is that Miltiades would not have been spared his life had he actually urged betrayal of the Persians. Again, it may be that a punitive expedition of the Scythians into the Chersonese soon afterwards resulting in Miltiades' flight from there was attributable to Darius' wrath (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.40" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.40</bibl>). Miltiades was brought back to the Chersonese by its inhabitants sometime before 499 (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.40.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.40.2</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Perhaps during this period Miltiades divorced the daughter of <persName><surname full="yes">Hippias</surname></persName>, who had become a political liability with that tyrant's fall in 510, and married the Thracian princess, Hegesipyle, daughter of <persName><surname full="yes">Olorus</surname></persName>; she was the mother of <persName><surname full="yes">Cimon</surname></persName>. At about this time Miltiades took the strategically important island of Lemnos, part of the Persian dominions in Ionia, and gave it to the Athenians (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.136.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.136.2</bibl>). He possibly took the island of Imbros at the same time, for he found safe haven there in the aftermath of the Ionian Revolt in 493 when the Phoenician fleet approached the Chersonese (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.104.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.104.1</bibl>). Miltiades escaped to Athens with four ships, but a fifth ship containing his older son Metiochos was captured by the Persians (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.41" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.41</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Upon his return to Athens, Miltiades was put on trial for tyranny in the Chersonese and acquitted (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.104.2" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.104.2</bibl>). Historians build a case for an alliance between Miltiades and Themistocles based on an anti-Persian stance the two may have held in common. One scenario holds it possible that Themistocles was Miltiades' judge, and that he biased the trial in Miltiades' favor. Between this trial and the Battle of Marathon he is mentioned only by Pausanias, who says that he had a herald of Darius killed (<bibl n="Paus. 3.12.7" default="NO" valid="yes">Paus. 3.12.7</bibl>), perhaps in order that the Persian king be angry with all of Athens as well as Miltiades himself.</p>
                <p>Darius was determined to punish the Athenians and the Eretrians for their part in the Ionian Revolt. In 490 his commanders Datis and Artaphernes sacked Eretria after a seven-day siege and led its inhabitants into captivity. The Persian fleet then made for the Bay of Marathon, on the east coast of Attica. At the time of the invasion Miltiades was serving as one of the ten generals of Athens (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.104" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.104</bibl>). The Athenians made the crucial decision to send out a force to oppose the Persians; they were joined by a contingent of Plataeans. The board of generals, which operated by concensus, was deadlocked whether or not to fight. There was an eleventh vote, however, that of the Polemarch, Callimachus of Aphidnae. Herodotus attributes to Miltiades a speech in which he persuades the Polemarch to cast his vote to fight, thereby turning the majority in favor of Miltiades' opinion (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.109" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.109</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Two issues are whether Callimachus and not Miltiades was actually in charge on the day of the battle, and if Miltiades, exactly how the command passed him. Herodotus says simply that each of the generals voting to fight resigned his presidency of the board in favor of Miltiades, who “accepted the office but did not make an attack until it was his own day to preside (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.110" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.110</bibl>).” On August 12, 490 the ten thousand or so Athenians and Plataeans, outnumbered perhaps ten to one, advanced at a run against the Persians (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.112.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.112.1</bibl>). In an attempt to cover the entire Persian front, the Athenians drew up in a line across the plain. This line was thin in the middle and deeper on each end. The Persians broke though the middle, but the Athenians and Plataeans routed the Persians on the flanks. Then, in a pincer movement, the Athenians turned their wings to crush the Persians who had broken through the center (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.110-115" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.110-115</bibl>). The Persians, having lost 6800 men, withdrew to the fleet. Of the Athenians, 192 fell.</p>
                <p>After the battle of Marathon, Miltiades was greatly esteemed in Athens. Consequently, he was able to convince the Athenians to send an expedition to take the island of Paros on the "pretext" (Herodotus' word) that “the Parians had brought this on themselves by first sending triremes with the Persian fleet to Marathon.” The historian goes on to allege that the real reason for the expedition was a grudge Miltiades held against a certain Parian, Lysagoras son of <persName><surname full="yes">Tisias</surname></persName>(<bibl n="Hdt. 6.133" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.133</bibl>). He besieged the city for 23 days, but received an injury in the leg (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.134" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.134</bibl>) and was forced to return Athens without taking the island.</p>
                <p>Upon his return charges were leveled against Miltiades that the Parian expedition had been an attempt to defraud the public. He was prosecuted by Xanthippus son of <persName><surname full="yes">Ariphron</surname></persName>, who called for the death penalty (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.136.1" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 6.136.1</bibl>); it is probable that this Xanthippus was the father of <persName><surname full="yes">Pericles</surname></persName>. Miltiades, weak from his wound and unable to defend himself, lay on a couch as his friends conducted his defence. The people found him guilty, but did not sentence him to death. Miltiades was fined 50 talents of silver, but died-in prison according to legend (Nepos, Milt. 8)-in 489 before he could pay the fine, which his son Cimon paid for him.</p>
